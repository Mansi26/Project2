   Post-Effective Amendment No. 60 to Registration Statement on Form N-4



   Prospectus Title: Multiple Sponsored Retirement Options



   File Nos.: 333-01107* and 811-02513



   Ladies and Gentlemen:



   The undersigned serves as counsel to ING Life Insurance and Annuity Company, a Connecticut life



   insurance company (the "Company"). It is my understanding that the Company, as depositor, has



   registered an indefinite amount of securities (the "Securities") under the Securities Act of 1933 (the



   "Securities Act") as provided in Rule 24f-2 under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the



   "Investment Company Act").



   In connection with this opinion, I have reviewed the N-4 Registration Statement, as amended to the



   date hereof, and this Post-Effective Amendment No. 60. I have also examined originals or copies,



   certified or otherwise identified to my satisfaction, of such documents, trust records and other



   instruments I have deemed necessary or appropriate for the purpose of rendering this opinion. For



   purposes of such examination, I have assumed the genuineness of all signatures on original documents



   and the conformity to the original of all copies.



   * Pursuant to Rule 429(a) under the Securities Act of 1933, Registrant has included a combined prospectus under this



   Registration Statement which includes all the information which would currently be required in a prospectus relating



   to the securities covered by the following earlier Registration Statements: 33-88720, 33-75964 (which had included



   a combined prospectus for earlier Registration Statements: 33-75958, 33-75960, and 33-75994); 33-75986 (which



   had included a combined prospectus for earlier Registration Statements: 33-75970, 33-75954, and 33-75956); 33-



   75982 (which had included a combined prospectus for earlier Registration Statements: 33-75986, 33-75966, 33-



   75990, and the individual deferred compensation contracts covered by Registration Statement No. 33-75992); and



   33-91846 (which had included a combined prospectus for earlier Registration Statement: 33-75976).

   I am admitted to practice law in Connecticut, and do not purport to be an expert on the laws of any



   other state. My opinion herein as to any other law is based upon a limited inquiry thereof which I have



   deemed appropriate under the circumstances.



   Based upon the foregoing, and, assuming the Securities are sold in accordance with the provisions of



   the prospectus, I am of the opinion that the Securities being registered will be legally issued and will



   represent binding obligations of the Company.



   I consent to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit to the Registration Statement.



   Sincerely,



   /s/ J. Neil McMurdie
