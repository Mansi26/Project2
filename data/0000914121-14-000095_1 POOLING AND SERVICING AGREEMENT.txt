 REMIC I



 As provided herein, with respect to the Trust, the Certificate Administrator on behalf of the Trustee will make an election for the segregated pool of assets described in the first (1st) paragraph of Section 12.1(a) hereof (including the Mortgage Loans (other than any Excess Interest payable with respect to such Mortgage Loans)) to be treated for federal income tax purposes as a REMIC ("REMIC I").  The REMIC I Regular Interests will be designated as the "regular interests" in REMIC I and the Class R Certificates will evidence the sole class of "residual interests" in REMIC I for purposes of the REMIC Provisions.



 Each REMIC I Regular Interest will relate to, and constitute the "Corresponding REMIC I Regular Interest" with respect to, a separate specific Mortgage Loan (including an REO Mortgage Loan) and any Qualifying Substitute Mortgage Loan that may replace such Mortgage Loan.  Each REMIC I Regular Interest will have a Pass-Through Rate equal to the applicable REMIC I Net Mortgage Rate from time to time, an initial REMIC I Principal Amount equal to the Cut-Off Date Principal Balance of the Mortgage Loan to which such REMIC I Regular Interest relates, and a "latest possible maturity date" set to the Rated Final Distribution Date.  The Class R Certificates will have no principal amount and no Pass-Through Rate, but (insofar as such Certificates represent the REMIC I Residual Interest) will entitle Holders thereof to receive the proceeds of any assets remaining in REMIC I after all the REMIC I Regular Interests have been paid in full.



 REMIC II



 As provided herein, with respect to the Trust, the Certificate Administrator on behalf of the Trustee will make an election for the segregated pool of assets described in the second (2nd) paragraph of Section 12.1(a) hereof consisting of the REMIC I Regular Interests to







 be treated for federal income tax purposes as a REMIC ("REMIC II").  The REMIC II Regular Interests will be designated as the "regular interests" in REMIC II and the Class R Certificates will evidence the sole class of "residual interests" in REMIC II for purposes of the REMIC Provisions.



 The following table sets forth the designation, the initial REMIC II Principal Amount, the corresponding Class of Principal Balance Certificates (the "Corresponding Certificates") and corresponding Class X REMIC III Regular Interest (the "Corresponding Class X REMIC III Regular Interest") with respect to each REMIC II Regular Interest.  Each REMIC II Regular Interest will have a Pass-Through Rate equal to the Weighted Average REMIC I Net Mortgage Rate from time to time.  The Class R Certificates will have no principal amount and no Pass-Through Rate, but (insofar as such Certificates represent the REMIC II Residual Interest) will entitle Holders thereof to receive the proceeds of any assets remaining in REMIC II after all the REMIC II Regular Interests have been paid in full.

On each Distribution Date, the Pass-Through Rate for each Class of Certificates (other than the Class PST and Class R Certificates) will be determined as set forth herein under the definition of "Pass-Through Rate."  The Class R Certificates will have no Aggregate Certificate Balance or Pass-Through Rate, but (insofar as such Certificates represent the REMIC III Residual Interest) will entitle the Holders thereof to receive the proceeds of any remaining assets in REMIC III after the Aggregate Certificate Balance of the Class A-1, Class A-2, Class A-SB, Class A-3, Class A-4, Class A-S, Class B, Class PST, Class C, Class D, Class E, Class F, Class G and Class H Certificates have been reduced to zero and any Collateral Support Deficits previously allocated thereto (and any interest thereon) have been reimbursed.

 (a)           Notwithstanding the terms of any related Mortgage Loan documents or other provisions of this Agreement, if any action under any Mortgage Loan documents or this Agreement requires a Rating Agency Confirmation as a condition precedent to such action, if the party (the "Requesting Party") attempting to obtain such Rating Agency Confirmation from each Rating Agency has made a request to any Rating Agency for such Rating Agency Confirmation and, within 10 Business Days of the Rating Agency Confirmation request being posted to the 17g-5 Information Provider's Website, such Rating Agency has not replied to such request or has responded in a manner that indicates that such Rating Agency is neither reviewing such request nor waiving the requirement for Rating Agency Confirmation, then (i) such Requesting Party shall (without providing notice to the 17g-5 Information Provider) confirm that the applicable Rating Agency has received the Rating Agency Confirmation request, and, if it has not, promptly request the related Rating Agency Confirmation again and (ii) if there is no response to either such Rating Agency Confirmation request within 5 Business Days of such second request or such Rating Agency has responded in a manner that indicates it is neither reviewing such request nor waiving the requirement for Rating Agency Confirmation, (x) with respect to any such condition in any Mortgage Loan document requiring such Rating Agency Confirmation or any other matter under this Agreement relating to the servicing of the Mortgage Loans (other than as set forth in clause (y) below), the Requesting Party (or, if the Requesting Party is the related Mortgagor, then the Master Servicer (with respect to non-Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans) or the Special Servicer (with respect to Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans and REO Loans), as applicable) shall determine, in accordance with its duties under this Agreement and, in the case of the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, in accordance with the Servicing Standard, whether or not such action would be in the best interests of the Certificateholders and, in the case of an A/B Whole Loan or Loan Pair, Certificateholders and any holder of the related B Note or Serviced Companion Loan (as a collective whole as if such Certificateholders and B Note or







 Serviced Companion Loan holder constituted a single lender), and if the Requesting Party (or, if the Requesting Party is the related Mortgagor, then the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as applicable) determines that such action would be in the best interest of such parties, then the requirement for a Rating Agency Confirmation will be deemed not to apply, and (y) with respect to a replacement of the Master Servicer or Special Servicer, such condition shall be deemed to be satisfied if (i) if Fitch is the non-responding Rating Agency, the applicable replacement is rated at least "CMS3" (in the case of the Master Servicer) or "CSS3" (in the case of the Special Servicer); or (ii) if Fitch is not the non-responding Rating Agency, the non-responding Rating Agency has not cited servicing concerns of the applicable replacement as the sole or material factor in any qualification, downgrade or withdrawal of the ratings (or placement on "watch status" in contemplation of a ratings downgrade or withdrawal) of securities in any other CMBS transaction rated by such non-responding Rating Agency and serviced by the applicable servicer prior to the time of determination.



 Promptly following the Master Servicer's or Special Servicer's determination to take any action discussed in this Section 1.7(a) following any requirement to obtain a Rating Agency Confirmation being considered satisfied, the Master Servicer or Special Servicer, as the case may be, shall provide electronic written notice to the 17g-5 Information Provider of the action taken for the particular item at such time, and the 17g-5 Information Provider shall post such notice on the 17g-5 Information Provider's Website in accordance with Section 5.7 of this Agreement.



 (b)           Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 1.7, for purposes of the provisions of any Mortgage Loan document relating to defeasance (including without limitation the type of collateral acceptable for use as defeasance collateral), release or substitution of any collateral, any Rating Agency Confirmation requirement in the Mortgage Loan documents with respect to which the Master Servicer or Special Servicer would have been required to make the determination described in Section 1.7(a) shall be deemed not to apply regardless of any such determination by the Requesting Party (or, if the Requesting Party is the related Mortgagor, the Master Servicer (with respect to non-Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans) or the Special Servicer (with respect to Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans and REO Loans), as applicable); provided, that the Requesting Party (or the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as applicable) shall in any event review the other conditions required under the related Mortgage Loan documents with respect to such defeasance, release or substitution and confirm to its satisfaction in accordance with the Servicing Standard that such conditions (other than the requirement for a Rating Agency Confirmation) have been satisfied.



 (c)           For all other matters or actions not specifically discussed in Section 1.7(a) above, the applicable Requesting Party shall deliver a Rating Agency Confirmation from each Rating Agency.

 ISSUANCES OF CERTIFICATES



 Section 2.1     Conveyance of Mortgage Loans.



 (a)           Effective as of the Closing Date, the Depositor does hereby establish a trust designated as "Morgan Stanley Bank of America Merrill Lynch Trust 2013-C12" and assign in trust to the Trustee, without recourse, for the benefit of the Certificateholders all the right, title and interest of the Depositor, in, to and under (i) the Mortgage Loans identified on the Mortgage Loan Schedule including the related Mortgage Notes, Mortgages, security agreements and title, hazard and other insurance policies, including all Qualifying Substitute Mortgage Loans, all distributions with respect thereto payable after the Cut-Off Date, the Mortgage File and all rights, if any, of the Depositor in the Distribution Account, all REO Accounts, the Collection Account and the Reserve Accounts, (ii) the Depositor's rights under each Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement that are permitted to be assigned to the Trustee pursuant to Section 14 thereof, (iii) the Initial Deposit, (iv) the Depositor's rights under any Intercreditor Agreement, Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan Intercreditor Agreement and the related Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan Pooling and Servicing Agreement with respect to any Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan, (v) with respect to the Exchangeable Certificates, each of the EC REMIC III Regular Interests and (vi) all other assets included or to be included in REMIC I or the Grantor Trust.  Such assignment includes all interest and principal received or receivable on or with respect to the Mortgage Loans and due after their respective Due Dates in October 2013.  The transfer of the Mortgage Loans and the related rights and property accomplished hereby is absolute and is intended by the parties to constitute a sale.  In connection with the initial sale of the Certificates by the Depositor, the purchase price to be paid includes a portion attributable to interest accruing on the Certificates from and after October 1, 2013.  The transfer and assignment of any Non-Serviced Mortgage Loans to the Trustee and the right to service such Mortgage Loans are subject to the terms and conditions of the related Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan Pooling and Servicing Agreement and the related Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan Intercreditor Agreement, and the Trustee, by the execution and delivery of this Agreement, hereby agrees that such Mortgage Loans remain subject to the terms of the related Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan Intercreditor Agreement and, with respect to each Serviced Pari Passu Mortgage Loan and Serviced Companion Loan, the related Intercreditor Agreement.  The transfer and assignment of any A Notes and Serviced Pari Passu Mortgage Loans to the Trustee and the right to service such Mortgage Loans are subject to the terms of the related Intercreditor Agreements, and the Trustee, by the execution and delivery of this Agreement, hereby agrees, that such Mortgage Loans remain subject to the terms of the related Intercreditor Agreements (or with respect to a Joint Mortgage Loan treated as a Loan Pair in accordance with Section 8.30 hereof, the applicable Mortgage Loan documents and Section 8.30 hereof).



 (b)           In connection with the Depositor's assignment pursuant to Section 2.1(a) above, the Depositor shall direct, and hereby represents and warrants that it has directed, each Seller pursuant to the applicable Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement to deliver to and deposit with, or cause to be delivered to and deposited with the Custodian (on behalf of the Trustee), on or before the Closing Date, the Mortgage Note for each Mortgage Loan so assigned, endorsed to the Trustee as specified in clause (i) of the definition of "Mortgage File."  Each Seller is







 required, pursuant to the applicable Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement, to deliver to the Custodian (on behalf of the Trustee) the remaining documents constituting the Mortgage File for each Mortgage Loan within the time period set forth therein.  None of the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator, any Custodian, the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer shall be liable for any failure by any Seller or the Depositor to comply with the document delivery requirements of the Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreements and this Section 2.1(b).  Promptly upon receipt (but no later than ten (10) Business Days after the Closing Date), the Custodian shall deliver to the Master Servicer each original letter of credit set forth on Schedule XVI hereto, and the Master Servicer shall hold such original letters of credit on behalf of the Trustee pursuant to and in accordance with clause (xii) of the definition of "Mortgage File".  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, with respect to a Joint Mortgage Loan, the obligations of each of the applicable Sellers to deliver a Mortgage Note to the Custodian (on behalf of the Trustee), shall be limited to delivery of only the Mortgage Note held by such party to the Custodian (on behalf of the Trustee).  With respect to a Joint Mortgage Loan, the obligations of the applicable Sellers to deliver the remaining portion of the related Mortgage File or any document required to be delivered with respect thereto shall be joint and several, provided that either of the applicable Sellers may deliver one Mortgage File or one of any other document required to be delivered with respect to such Mortgage Loan hereunder and such delivery shall satisfy such delivery requirements for each of the applicable Sellers.



 (c)           The applicable Seller has agreed in the applicable Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement, at the expense of such Seller as to each of its respective Mortgage Loans (other than with respect to any Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan), (i) in the case of clauses (iv) and (vi)(B) of the definition of "Mortgage File" within forty-five (45) days following the Closing Date and (ii) in the case of clause (ix)(B) of the definition of "Mortgage File" within ninety (90) days following the Closing Date, to deliver for submission for recording or filing by the Depositor, the Custodian (on behalf of the Trustee) or the agents of either, as the case may be, in the appropriate public office for real property records or UCC financing statements, as appropriate, each assignment referred to in clauses (iv), (vi)(B) and (ix)(B) of the definition of "Mortgage File."  Each such assignment shall reflect that it should be returned by the public recording office to the Custodian (on behalf of the Trustee) following recording or filing; provided that in those instances where the public recording office retains the original Assignment of Mortgage, assignment of Assignment of Leases or assignment of UCC financing statements, the applicable Seller shall obtain therefrom a certified copy of the recorded original and forward such copy to the Custodian (on behalf of the Trustee) and the Special Servicer.  If any such document or instrument is lost or returned unrecorded or unfiled, as the case may be, because of a defect therein, the applicable Seller shall, pursuant to the applicable Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement, promptly prepare or cause to be prepared a substitute therefor or cure such defect, as the case may be, and thereafter the applicable Seller shall, at its own expense (except in the case of a document or instrument that is lost by the Custodian), upon receipt thereof cause the same to be duly recorded or filed, as appropriate.



 The parties acknowledge the obligation of each Seller pursuant to Section 2 of the related Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement to deliver to or on behalf of the Trustee, on or before the fifth (5th) Business Day after the Closing Date, five (5) limited powers of attorney substantially in the form attached as Exhibit 4 to the Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement in favor of the Custodian (on behalf of the Trustee) and the Special Servicer to empower the Custodian (on







 behalf of the Trustee) and, in the event of the failure or incapacity of the Custodian (on behalf of the Trustee), the Special Servicer, to submit, or to cause the Custodian to submit for recording, at the expense of the applicable Seller, any mortgage loan documents required to be recorded as set forth in the preceding paragraph and any intervening assignments with evidence of recording thereon that are required to be included in the Mortgage Files (so long as original counterparts have previously been delivered to or on behalf of the Trustee).  The Sellers agree to reasonably cooperate with the Custodian, the Trustee and the Special Servicer in connection with any additional powers of attorney or revisions thereto that are requested by such parties for purposes of such recordation.  The Trustee and each other party hereto agrees that no such power of attorney shall be used with respect to any Mortgage Loan by or under authorization by any party hereto except to the extent that the absence of a document described in the second (2nd) preceding sentence with respect to such Mortgage Loan remains unremedied as of the earlier of (i) the date that is 180 days following the delivery of notice of such absence to the related Seller, but in no event earlier than 18 months from the Closing Date, and (ii) the date (if any) on which such Mortgage Loan becomes a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan.  The Custodian shall submit such documents for recording, at the related Seller's expense, after the periods set forth above; provided, the Custodian shall not submit such assignments for recording if the applicable Seller produces evidence that it has sent any such assignment for recording and certifies that it is awaiting its return from the applicable recording office.  Each of the Sellers has engaged a separate third party agent other than the Custodian or the Trustee to perform the recording obligations described in this Section 2.1(c).



 (d)           All relevant servicing or loan documents and records in the possession of the Depositor or the Sellers that relate to the Mortgage Loans, Serviced Companion Loans or B Notes and that are not required to be a part of a Mortgage File in accordance with the definition thereof shall be delivered to the Master Servicer, on or before the date that is forty-five (45) days following the Closing Date and shall be held by the Master Servicer on behalf of the Trustee in trust for the benefit of the Certificateholders.  To the extent delivered to the Master Servicer by the related Seller, the Servicer Mortgage File shall include, to the extent required to be (and actually) delivered to the applicable Seller pursuant to the applicable Mortgage Loan documents, copies of each item set forth in the definition of "Servicer Mortgage File" in this Agreement.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Seller shall be required to deliver any draft documents, or any attorney-client communications that are privileged communications or constitute legal or other due diligence analyses or attorney work product, or internal communications of the Seller or its affiliates among themselves or with their respective attorneys, or credit underwriting or other analyses or data (and, if received, shall be returned and any copies thereof destroyed).  Delivery of any of the foregoing documents to a sub-servicer shall be deemed delivery to the Master Servicer and satisfy the Depositor's obligations under this Section 2.1(d).  Neither the Master Servicer nor the Special Servicer shall have any liability for the absence of any of the foregoing items from the Servicer Mortgage File if such item was not delivered by the related Seller.



 (e)            In connection with the Depositor's assignment pursuant to Section 2.1(a) above, the Depositor shall deliver to the Trustee on or before the Closing Date a copy of a fully executed counterpart of each Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement, as in full force and effect on the Closing Date, which Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreements shall contain the representations







 and warranties (and the exceptions thereto) made by the Sellers with respect to each related Mortgage Loan as of the Closing Date.



 (f)            In connection herewith, the Depositor has acquired the MSMCH Loans from MSMCH, the BANA Loans from BANA and the CIBC Loans from CIBC.  The Depositor shall deliver or cause to be delivered the original Mortgage Notes (or lost note affidavits with copies of the related Mortgage Notes, as set forth in the definition of "Mortgage File") relating to the Mortgage Loans to the Custodian (on behalf of the Trustee), endorsed as otherwise provided herein, to effect the transfer to the Trustee of such Mortgage Notes and all related deeds of trust, mortgages and other loan documents.  To avoid the unnecessary expense and administrative inconvenience associated with the execution and recording or filing of multiple assignment documents, BANA, MSMCH and CIBC, as applicable, are required under the Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreements to deliver Assignments of Mortgages, and assignments of Assignments of Leases and assignments of UCC financing statements naming the Trustee, on behalf of the Certificateholders, as assignee.  Notwithstanding the fact that such Assignments of Mortgages, assignments of Assignments of Leases (to the extent separate from the Assignments of Mortgages) and assignments of UCC financing statements shall name the Trustee, on behalf of the Certificateholders, as the assignee, the parties hereto acknowledge and agree that for all purposes the MSMCH Loans shall be deemed to have been transferred from MSMCH to the Depositor, the BANA Loans shall be deemed to have been transferred from BANA to the Depositor, and the CIBC Loans shall be deemed to have been transferred from CIBC to the Depositor, and all Mortgage Loans shall be deemed to have been transferred from the Depositor to the Trustee on behalf of the Certificateholders.



 Section 2.2     Acceptance by Trustee.  The Custodian (on behalf of the Trustee) hereby acknowledges receipt of a Trust Mortgage File for each Mortgage Loan and confirms that, with respect to each Mortgage Loan, all documents listed in clauses (i), (ii), (vii), (viii), (x) and (xii) of the definition of "Mortgage File" are in its possession.  Within ten (10) days of the Closing Date, the Custodian shall provide a copy of all documents listed in clauses (i), (ii), (vii), (viii), (x) and (xii) of the definition of "Mortgage File" to the Master Servicer.  The Custodian will hold (i) the documents constituting a part of the Mortgage Files delivered to it or the Custodian on its behalf, (ii) the REMIC I Regular Interests, (iii) the REMIC II Regular Interests, in each case on behalf of the Trustee in trust for the use and benefit of all present and future Certificateholders and (iv) the EC REMIC III Regular Interests, in each case on behalf of the Trustee in trust for the use and benefit of all present and future Holders of the Exchangeable Certificates.  To the extent that the contents of the Mortgage File for any A Note relate to the corresponding B Note, the Custodian (on the Trustee's behalf), will also hold such Mortgage File in trust for the benefit of the holder of the related B Note; provided, that if a B Note remains outstanding following payment in full of the amounts due under the related A Notes, the Mortgage Loan documents relating to such A/B Whole Loan (exclusive of any such documents related solely to the A Notes) shall be assigned to the holder of the B Note or its designee at the expense of the holder of the B Note and delivered to such B Note holder.  To the extent that the contents of the Mortgage File for any Serviced Pari Passu Mortgage Loan relate to the corresponding Serviced Companion Loan, the Trustee, or the Custodian, on the Trustee's behalf, will also hold such Mortgage File in trust for the benefit of the holder of the related Serviced Companion Loan.







 On the Closing Date in respect of the Initial Certification, and within seventy-five (75) days after the Closing Date in respect of the Final Certification, the Custodian (on the Trustee's behalf) shall examine the Mortgage Files in its possession, and shall deliver to the Depositor, the Sellers, the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator, the 17g-5 Information Provider, the Controlling Class Representative and, upon request, the holder of any Serviced Companion Loan a certification (the "Initial Certification" and the "Final Certification", respectively, in the respective forms set forth as Exhibit B-1 and Exhibit B-2 hereto), which shall be in electronic format (i) in the case of the Initial Certification, as to each Mortgage Loan listed in the Mortgage Loan Schedule, except as may be specified in the schedule of exceptions attached thereto, to the effect that:  (A) all documents listed in clauses (i), (ii), (vii), (viii), (x) and (xii) of the definition of "Mortgage File" are in its possession, (B) such documents have been reviewed by it and have not been materially mutilated, damaged, defaced, torn or otherwise physically altered, and such documents relate to such Mortgage Loan, and (C) each Mortgage Note has been endorsed as provided in clause (i) of the definition of "Mortgage File", and (ii) in the case of the Final Certification, as to each Mortgage Loan listed in the Mortgage Loan Schedule, except as may be specified in the schedule of exceptions attached thereto, to the effect that:  (A) all documents listed in clauses (i), (ii), (iv), (v), (vi), (vii), (viii), (x) and (xii) of the definition of "Mortgage File" required to be included in the Mortgage File (to the extent required to be delivered pursuant to this Agreement), and with respect to all documents specified in the other clauses of the definition of "Mortgage File" to the extent known by a Responsible Officer of the Custodian (on the Trustee's behalf) to be required pursuant to this Agreement, are in its possession, (B) such documents have been reviewed by it and have not been materially mutilated, damaged, defaced, torn or otherwise physically altered, and such documents relate to such Mortgage Loan, (C) based on its examination and only as to the Mortgage Note and Mortgage, the street address (excluding zip code) of the Mortgaged Property set forth in the Mortgage Loan Schedule respecting such Mortgage Loan accurately reflects the information contained in the documents in the Mortgage File, and (D) each Mortgage Note has been endorsed.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the delivery of a commitment to issue a Title Insurance Policy in lieu of the delivery of the actual Title Insurance Policy shall not be considered a Material Document Defect with respect to any Mortgage File if such actual Title Insurance Policy is delivered to the Custodian (on the Trustee's behalf) not later than the 180th day following the Closing Date.



 Within 360 days after the Cut-Off Date, the Custodian (on the Trustee's behalf) shall provide a confirmation of receipt of recorded assignments of Mortgage (as set forth in the definition of "Mortgage File," with evidence of recording thereon) or otherwise provide evidence of such recordation to the Trustee, the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Certificate Administrator, the 17g-5 Information Provider (who shall promptly post such confirmation to the 17g-5 Information Provider's Website pursuant to Section 5.7), the Controlling Class Representative and each Seller.  The Custodian (on behalf of the Trustee) shall use reasonable efforts to submit for recording any unrecorded assignments of Mortgage that have been delivered to it (including effecting such recordation process through or cooperating with the applicable Seller), such recordation to be at the expense of the applicable Seller; provided, that the Custodian (on the Trustee's behalf) shall not submit for recording any such assignments if the applicable Seller produces evidence that it has sent any such assignment for recording and is awaiting its return from the applicable recording office.  In giving the certifications required above, neither the Trustee nor the Custodian (on the Trustee's behalf) shall be under any







 obligation or duty to inspect, review or examine any such documents, instruments, securities or other papers to determine whether they or the signatures thereon are valid, legal, genuine, enforceable, in recordable form or appropriate for their represented purposes, or that they are other than what they purport to be on their face, or to determine whether any Mortgage File should include any assumption agreement, modification agreement, consolidation agreement, extension agreement, Assignment of Lease, ground lease, UCC financing statement, guaranty, written assurance, substitution agreement, lock box agreement, intercreditor agreement, management agreement or letter of credit.



 If any exceptions are noted on a schedule of exceptions attached to the Final Certification, including exceptions resulting from the fact that the recordation and/or filing has not been completed (based solely on the absence of receipt by the Custodian (on the Trustee's behalf) of the particular documents showing evidence of the recordation and/or filing), then the Custodian (on the Trustee's behalf) shall continuously update such schedule of exceptions to reflect receipt of any corrected documents, additional documents or instruments or evidences of recordation and/or filing, as to each Mortgage Loan, until the earliest of the following dates:  (i) the date on which all such exceptions are eliminated (any such elimination resulting from the fact that recordation and/or filing has been completed shall be based solely on receipt by the Custodian (on the Trustee's behalf) of the particular documents showing evidence of the recordation and/or filing), (ii) the date on which all the affected Mortgage Loans are removed from the Trust and (iii) the second (2nd) anniversary of the Closing Date, and shall provide such updated schedule of exceptions (which may be in electronic format) to each of the Trustee, the Depositor, each Seller (as to its respective Mortgage Loans only), the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Certificate Administrator, the 17g-5 Information Provider (who shall post such updated schedule of exceptions on the 17g-5 Information Provider's Website pursuant to Section 5.7), the Controlling Class Representative and the holder of any Serviced Companion Loan on or about the date that is 180 days after the Closing Date and then again every ninety (90) days thereafter (until the earliest date specified above).  Upon request, the Master Servicer shall provide to the Trustee and to the Custodian the names and addresses of each holder of a Serviced Companion Loan of which the Master Servicer has received notice in accordance with this Agreement and/or the related Intercreditor Agreement.



 The Custodian or its authorized agents shall retain possession and custody of each Trust Mortgage File in accordance with and subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein.



 The Custodian shall hold that portion of the Trust Fund delivered to the Custodian consisting of "instruments" (as such term is defined in Section 9-102 of the Uniform Commercial Code as in effect in Minnesota on the date hereof) in Minnesota and, except as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement, shall not remove such instruments from Minnesota unless it receives an Opinion of Counsel (obtained and delivered at the expense of the Person requesting the removal of such instruments from Minnesota) that if the transfer of the Mortgage Loans to the Trustee is deemed not to be a sale, after such removal, the Trustee will possess a first priority perfected security interest in such instruments.







 Section 2.3     Sellers' Repurchase of Mortgage Loans for Material Document Defects and Material Breaches of Representations and Warranties.



 (a)           If any party hereto discovers that any document or documents constituting a part of a Mortgage File has not been delivered as and when required, has not been properly executed, or is defective on its face or discovers or receives notice of a breach of any of the representations and warranties relating to the Mortgage Loans required to be made by a Seller regarding the characteristics of the Mortgage Loans and/or related Mortgaged Properties as set forth in Exhibit 2 of the related Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreements, and either (i) the defect or breach, as the case may be, materially and adversely affects the interests of the holders of the Certificates in the related Mortgage Loan or (ii) both (A) the defect or breach materially and adversely affects the value of the Mortgage Loan and (B) the Mortgage Loan is a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan or Rehabilitated Mortgage Loan (any such defect described in the preceding clause (i) or (ii), a "Material Document Defect", and such a breach described in the preceding clause (i) or (ii), a "Material Breach"), then the party determining that such Material Document Defect or Material Breach exists shall give prompt written notice to the Depositor, the other parties hereto, the related Seller and the 17g-5 Information Provider subject to the terms of the applicable Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement.  Promptly (but in any event within three (3) Business Days) upon determining (or becoming aware of another party's determination) that any such Material Document Defect or Material Breach exists (which determination shall, absent evidence to the contrary, be presumed to be no earlier than three (3) Business Days prior to the delivery of the notice referred to below), the Master Servicer shall, and the Special Servicer may, request that the related Seller, not later than ninety (90) days from such Seller's receipt of the notice of such Material Document Defect or Material Breach, cure such Material Document Defect or Material Breach, as the case may be, in all material respects; provided, that if such Material Document Defect or Material Breach, as the case may be, cannot be corrected or cured in all material respects within such 90-day period, and such Material Document Defect or Material Breach would not cause the Mortgage Loan to be other than a "qualified mortgage" (as defined in the Code) but the related Seller is diligently attempting to effect such correction or cure, as certified by such Seller in an Officer's Certificate delivered to the Trustee and the Custodian, then the cure period will be extended for an additional ninety (90) days unless, solely in the case of a Material Document Defect, (x) the Mortgage Loan is then a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan and a Servicing Transfer Event has occurred as a result of a monetary default or as set forth in clause (ii) or clause (v) of the definition of "Servicing Transfer Event" and (y) the Material Document Defect was identified in a certification delivered to the Seller by the Custodian (on behalf of the Trustee) pursuant to Section 2.2 not less than ninety (90) days prior to the receipt by the applicable Seller of the notice of such Material Document Defect.  The parties acknowledge that neither delivery of a certification or schedule of exceptions to a Seller pursuant to Section 2.2 or otherwise nor possession of such certification or schedule by the Seller shall, in and of itself, constitute delivery of notice of any Material Document Defect or knowledge or awareness by the Seller or any party hereto of any Material Document Defect listed therein.



 If any Material Document Defect or Material Breach that exists cannot be corrected or cured in all material respects within the above cure periods, the related Seller is obligated under the related Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement, not later than the last day of such permitted cure period, subject to Section 5.12 of each Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement,







 to (i) repurchase the affected Mortgage Loan (or, with respect to any Joint Mortgage Loan, the related Seller's pro rata share based on such Seller's percentage interest as of the date of the applicable Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement in such Joint Mortgage Loan) or REO Mortgage Loan (or, with respect to any Joint Mortgage Loan, the related Seller's pro rata share based on such Seller's percentage interest as of the date of the applicable Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement in such Joint Mortgage Loan) from the Trust at the applicable Purchase Price in accordance with the related Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement, or (ii) if within the three-month period commencing on the Closing Date (or prior to the second anniversary of the Closing Date if the related Mortgage Loan is a "defective obligation" within the meaning of Section 860G(a)(4)(B)(ii) of the Code and Treasury Regulations Section 1.860G-2(f)), at the related Seller's option, without recourse (other than the representations and warranties made with respect thereto), replace such Mortgage Loan (or, with respect to any Joint Mortgage Loan, the related Seller's pro rata share based on such Seller's percentage interest as of the date of the applicable Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement in such Joint Mortgage Loan) or REO Mortgage Loan (or, with respect to any Joint Mortgage Loan, the related Seller's pro rata share based on such Seller's percentage interest as of the date of the applicable Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement in such Joint Mortgage Loan) with a Qualifying Substitute Mortgage Loan and pay a substitution shortfall amount equal to the excess, if any, of the applicable Purchase Price for the Mortgage Loan or REO Mortgage Loan to be replaced, over the Stated Principal Balance of the Qualifying Substitute Mortgage Loan.  If such Material Document Defect or Material Breach would cause the Mortgage Loan to be other than a "qualified mortgage" (as defined in the Code), then notwithstanding the previous sentence or the previous paragraph, the cure, repurchase or substitution must occur within eighty-five (85) days from the date the related Seller was notified of the defect or breach; provided, that in any event any such cure, repurchase or substitution must occur no later than eighty-five (85) days from the date of determination of the existence of a Material Document Defect or Material Breach as determined in this Section 2.3(a).



 As to any Qualifying Substitute Mortgage Loan or Loans, the Master Servicer shall not execute any instrument effecting the substitution unless the related Seller has delivered to the Custodian (on the Trustee's behalf) for such Qualifying Substitute Mortgage Loan or Loans, the Mortgage Note, the Mortgage, the related Assignment of Mortgage, and such other documents and agreements as are required by Section 2.1, with the Mortgage Note endorsed as required by Section 2.1, and the Master Servicer shall be entitled to rely on statements and certifications from the Custodian for this purpose.  No substitution may be made in any calendar month after the Determination Date for such month.  Monthly payments due with respect to Qualifying Substitute Mortgage Loans in the month of substitution shall not be part of the Trust and will be retained by Master Servicer and remitted by the Master Servicer to the related Seller on the next succeeding Distribution Date.  For the month of substitution, distributions to Certificateholders will include the Scheduled Payment due on the related Deleted Mortgage Loan for such month and thereafter the related Seller shall be entitled to retain all amounts received in respect of such Deleted Mortgage Loan.



 The Master Servicer shall amend or cause to be amended the Mortgage Loan Schedule to reflect the removal of such Deleted Mortgage Loan and the substitution of the Qualifying Substitute Mortgage Loan or Loans and upon such amendment the Master Servicer shall deliver or cause to be delivered such amended Mortgage Loan Schedule to the Trustee, the Custodian, the Certificate Administrator and the Special Servicer.  Upon such substitution, the







 Qualifying Substitute Mortgage Loan or Loans shall be subject to the terms of this Agreement in all respects.  Upon receipt of the Trust Mortgage File pertaining to any Qualifying Substitute Mortgage Loans, the Custodian shall release the Trust Mortgage File relating to such Deleted Mortgage Loan to the related Seller, and the Trustee (and the Depositor, if necessary) shall execute and deliver such instruments of transfer or assignment in the form presented to it, in each case without recourse, representation or warranty, as shall be necessary to vest title (to the extent that such title was transferred to the Trustee or the Depositor) in the related Seller or its designee to any Deleted Mortgage Loan (including any property acquired in respect thereof or any insurance policy proceeds relating thereto) substituted for pursuant to this Section 2.3.



 If (x) a Mortgage Loan is to be repurchased or replaced as contemplated above (a "Defective Mortgage Loan"), (y) such Defective Mortgage Loan is cross-collateralized and cross-defaulted with one or more other Mortgage Loans (such Defective Mortgage Loan and such other Mortgage Loans, collectively, "Crossed Mortgage Loans") and (z) the applicable document defect or breach does not constitute a Material Document Defect or Material Breach, as the case may be, as to such other Crossed Mortgage Loans (without regard to this paragraph), then the applicable document defect or breach (as the case may be) shall be deemed to constitute a Material Document Defect or Material Breach (as the case may be) as to each such other Crossed Mortgage Loan for purposes of the above provisions, and the related Seller shall be obligated to repurchase or replace each such other Crossed Mortgage Loan in accordance with the provisions above unless, in the case of such breach or document defect, (A) the Seller provides a Nondisqualification Opinion to the Trustee at the expense of the Seller and (B) both of the following conditions would be satisfied if the related Seller were to repurchase or replace only those Mortgage Loans as to which a Material Breach or Material Document Defect had occurred without regard to this paragraph (the "Affected Loan(s)"):  (i) the Debt Service Coverage Ratio for all such Crossed Mortgage Loans (excluding the Affected Loan(s)) for the four (4) calendar quarters immediately preceding the repurchase or replacement is not less than the lesser of (A) 0.10x below the debt service coverage ratio for all such Crossed Mortgage Loans (including the Affected Loan(s)) set forth in Appendix I to the Prospectus Supplement and (B) the Debt Service Coverage Ratio for all such Crossed Mortgage Loans (including the Affected Loan(s)) for the four (4) preceding calendar quarters preceding the repurchase or replacement, and (ii) the Loan-to-Value Ratio for all such Crossed Mortgage Loans (excluding the Affected Loan(s)) is not greater than the greater of (A) the loan-to-value ratio, expressed as a whole number (taken to one decimal place), for all such Crossed Mortgage Loans (including the Affected Loan(s)) set forth in Appendix I to the Prospectus Supplement plus 10% and (B) the Loan-to-Value Ratio for all such Crossed Mortgage Loans (including the Affected Loan(s)), at the time of repurchase or replacement.  The determination of the Master Servicer as to whether the conditions set forth above have been satisfied shall be conclusive and binding in the absence of manifest error.  The Master Servicer will be entitled to cause to be delivered, or direct the related Seller to (in which case the related Seller shall be required under the related Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement to) cause to be delivered to the Master Servicer, an Appraisal of any or all of the related Mortgaged Properties for purposes of determining whether the condition set forth in clause (ii) above has been satisfied, in each case at the expense of the related Seller if the scope and cost of the Appraisal is approved by the related Seller (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld).







 With respect to any Defective Mortgage Loan, to the extent that the applicable Seller is required to repurchase or substitute for such Defective Mortgage Loan (each, a "Repurchased Loan") in the manner prescribed above while the Custodian (on the Trustee's behalf) continues to hold any Crossed Mortgage Loan, the applicable Seller and the Depositor have agreed in the related Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement to forbear from enforcing any remedies against the other's Primary Collateral but each is permitted to exercise remedies against the Primary Collateral securing its respective Mortgage Loans, including with respect to the Trustee, the Primary Collateral securing Mortgage Loans still held by the Trustee or the Custodian, so long as such exercise does not impair the ability of the other party to exercise its remedies against its Primary Collateral.  If the exercise of remedies by one party would impair the ability of the other party to exercise its remedies with respect to the Primary Collateral securing the Mortgage Loan or Mortgage Loans held by such party, then both parties have agreed to forbear from exercising such remedies until the loan documents evidencing and securing the relevant Mortgage Loans can be modified in a manner that complies with the applicable Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement to remove the threat of impairment as a result of the exercise of remedies.  Any reserve or other cash collateral or letters of credit securing the Crossed Mortgage Loans shall be allocated between such Mortgage Loans in accordance with the Mortgage Loan documents, or otherwise on a pro rata basis based upon their outstanding principal balances.  All other terms of the Mortgage Loans shall remain in full force and effect, without any modification thereof.  The Mortgagors set forth on Schedule VI hereto are intended third-party beneficiaries of the provisions set forth in this paragraph and the preceding paragraph.  The provisions of this paragraph and the preceding paragraph may not be modified with respect to any Mortgage Loan without the related Mortgagor's consent.



 Any of the following document defects shall be conclusively presumed materially and adversely to affect the interests of Certificateholders in a Mortgage Loan and be a Material Document Defect:  (A) the absence from the Mortgage File of the original signed Mortgage Note, unless the Mortgage File contains a signed lost note affidavit and indemnity that appears to be regular on its face (if such absence results from the related Seller's failure to deliver such item); (B) the absence from the Mortgage File of the original signed Mortgage (or with respect to any Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan, a copy thereof) that appears to be regular on its face, unless there is included in the Mortgage File a certified copy of the Mortgage by the local authority with which the Mortgage was recorded (if such absence results from the related Seller's failure to deliver such item); (C) the absence from the Mortgage File of the item called for by paragraph (viii) of the definition of "Mortgage File" (or with respect to any Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan, a copy thereof) (if such absence results from the related Seller's failure to deliver such item); (D) the absence from the Mortgage File of the original or a copy of any letter of credit in effect as of the Closing Date (if such absence results from the related Seller's failure to deliver such item); or (E) the absence from the Mortgage File of a copy of the item specified in paragraph (x) of the definition of "Mortgage File" (if such absence results from the related Seller's failure to deliver such item) if the related Mortgage Loan is secured only by the related ground lease, space lease or air rights lease.  If any party hereto notifies the Trustee of the occurrence of any of the foregoing Material Document Defects, the Trustee (or as set forth in this Section 2.3(a), the Master Servicer) shall take the steps described elsewhere in this Section 2.3(a), including the giving of notices to the related Seller, the Rating Agencies (subject to Section 5.7), the parties hereto and, to the extent any Material Document Defect relates to a Serviced Pari Passu Mortgage Loan, the holder of the related Serviced Companion Loan, and the Master







 Servicer shall make demand upon the related Seller for the cure of the document defect or repurchase or replacement of the related Mortgage Loan.



 If the related Seller disputes that a Material Document Defect or Material Breach exists with respect to a Mortgage Loan or otherwise refuses (i) to effect a correction or cure of such Material Document Defect or Material Breach, (ii) to repurchase the affected Mortgage Loan from the Trust or (iii) to replace such Mortgage Loan with a Qualifying Substitute Mortgage Loan, each in accordance with the related Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement, then provided that (x) the period of time provided for the related Seller to correct, repurchase or cure has expired and (y) the Mortgage Loan is then in default and is then a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan, the Special Servicer may, subject to the Servicing Standard, modify, workout or foreclose, sell or otherwise liquidate (or permit the liquidation of) the Mortgage Loan pursuant to Section 9.5, Section 9.12, Section 9.13, Section 9.15, Section 9.16, Section 9.17 and Section 10.3 and the terms and conditions of any related Intercreditor Agreement, as applicable, while pursuing the repurchase claim.  The related Seller has acknowledged and agreed under the related Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement that any modification of the Mortgage Loan pursuant to a workout shall not constitute a defense to any repurchase claim nor shall such modification and workout change the Purchase Price due from the related Seller for any repurchase claim.  In the event of any such modification and workout, the related Seller has agreed under the related Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement to repurchase the Mortgage Loan as modified and that the Purchase Price shall include any Workout Fee paid to the Special Servicer up to the date of repurchase plus the present value (calculated at the applicable Calculation Rate) of the Workout Fee that would have been payable to the Special Servicer in respect of such Mortgage Loan if the Mortgage Loan performed in accordance with its terms to its Maturity Date, provided that no amount shall be paid by the related Seller in respect of any Workout Fee if a Liquidation Fee already comprises (or will comprise) a portion of the Purchase Price or if the related Mortgagor has already paid such fee.  The related Seller shall be notified promptly and in writing by the Special Servicer of any offer that it receives to purchase the applicable Mortgage Loan or REO Property, each in connection with such liquidation.  Any sale of the related Mortgage Loan, or foreclosure upon such Mortgage Loan and sale of the related REO Property, to a Person other than the related Seller shall be without (i) recourse of any kind (either expressed or implied) by such Person against the related Seller and (ii) representation or warranty of any kind (either expressed or implied) by the related Seller to or for the benefit of such Person.



 The fact that a Material Document Defect or Material Breach is not discovered until after the completion of foreclosure (but in all instances prior to the sale of the related REO Property) shall not prejudice any claim against the Seller for repurchase of the REO Property (or the Trust's interest therein).  In such an event, the Master Servicer shall notify the related Seller of the discovery of the Material Document Defect or Material Breach and the related Seller shall have ninety (90) days to correct or cure such Material Document Defect or Material Breach or purchase the REO Property (or the Trust's interest therein) at the Purchase Price.  If the related Seller fails to correct or cure the Material Document Defect or Material Breach or purchase the REO Property, then the provisions above regarding notice of offers related to such REO Property shall apply.  After a final liquidation of the Mortgage Loan or REO Property, if a court of competent jurisdiction issues a final order after the expiration of any applicable appeal period that the related Seller is or was obligated to repurchase the related Mortgage Loan or REO







 Property (a "Final Judicial Determination") or the related Seller otherwise accepts liability, then, but in no event later than the termination of the Trust pursuant to Section 11.1, the related Seller will be obligated to pay to the Trust the difference between any Liquidation Proceeds received upon such liquidation (including those arising from any sale to the related Seller) and the Purchase Price.



 In any month in which the related Seller substitutes one or more Qualifying Substitute Mortgage Loans for one or more Deleted Mortgage Loans, the Master Servicer will determine the amount (if any) by which the aggregate Stated Principal Balance of all such Qualifying Substitute Mortgage Loans as of the date of substitution is less than the aggregate Stated Principal Balance of all such Deleted Mortgage Loans (in each case after application of scheduled principal portion of the monthly payments received in the month of substitution).  The Depositor shall cause the related Seller to deposit the amount of such shortage into the Collection Account in the month of substitution, without any reimbursement thereof.  In addition, the Depositor shall cause the related Seller to deposit into the Collection Account, together with such shortage, if any, an amount equal to interest on the Deleted Mortgage Loans at a rate equal to the sum of the applicable Mortgage Rate from the Due Date as to which interest was last paid up to the Due Date next succeeding such substitution together with the amount of unreimbursed Servicing Advances, amounts required to be paid to the Special Servicer but remaining unpaid or unreimbursed, and interest on unreimbursed Advances with respect to such Deleted Mortgage Loans at the Advance Rate.  The Depositor shall cause the related Seller, in the case of the Mortgage Loans, to give notice in writing (accompanied by an Officer's Certificate as to the calculation of such shortage) to the Trustee, the Custodian, the Certificate Administrator and the Master Servicer of such event which notice shall be accompanied by an Officer's Certificate as to the calculation of such shortfall.



 If the affected Mortgage Loan is to be repurchased, the Master Servicer shall designate the Collection Account as the account to which funds in the amount of the Purchase Price are to be wired.  Any such purchase of a Mortgage Loan shall be on a whole loan, servicing released basis.



 Notwithstanding the foregoing, if there is a breach of the representations and warranties set forth in paragraph 30 or paragraph 32 in Exhibit 2 to any Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement, and as a result the payments by a Mortgagor of reasonable costs and expenses associated with securing the consent or approval of the holder of the Mortgage for a waiver of a "due-on-sale" or "due-on-encumbrance" clause or the defeasance of a Mortgage Loan are insufficient such that the Trust incurs an Additional Trust Expense in an amount equal to such reasonable costs and expenses not paid by such Mortgagor, the related Seller has agreed to reimburse the Trust within ninety (90) days of the receipt of notice of such breach in an amount sufficient to avoid such Additional Trust Expense.  With respect to any Joint Mortgage Loan, the applicable Seller's obligation shall be such Seller's pro rata share based on such Seller's percentage interest as of the date of the applicable Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement in such Joint Mortgage Loan.  The parties hereto acknowledge that such reimbursement shall be the only obligation of the related Seller with respect to the breach discussed in the second preceding sentence.







 If a Mortgage Loan or REO Property is repurchased or replaced by a Seller as contemplated by this Section 2.3, the Master Servicer shall provide prompt electronic notice to the Certificate Administrator (who shall promptly post such notice on the Certificate Administrator's Website pursuant to Section 5.4) and the 17g-5 Information Provider (who shall promptly post such notice on the 17g-5 Information Provider's Website pursuant to Section 5.7).



 With respect to any Joint Mortgage Loan, the obligations of each of the applicable Sellers to repurchase or substitute with respect to a Material Document Defect or Material Breach with respect to the related Mortgage Loan shall be limited to a repurchase or substitution with respect to the Mortgage Note it sold to the Depositor in accordance with the related Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement.  With respect to any Joint Mortgage Loan, any cure by either of the applicable Sellers with respect to the Mortgage Note sold by it to the Depositor in accordance with the related Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement that also cures the Material Document Defect or Material Breach with respect to the entire related Joint Mortgage Loan shall satisfy the cure obligations of both Sellers with respect to such Joint Mortgage Loan.



 (b)           In connection with any repurchase of or substitution for a Mortgage Loan contemplated by this Section 2.3, the Trustee, the Custodian, the Master Servicer and the Special Servicer shall each tender to the related Seller, after delivery to each of them of a receipt executed by such Seller, all portions of the Mortgage File and other documents pertaining to such Mortgage Loan possessed by it, and each document that constitutes a part of the Mortgage File shall be endorsed or assigned to the extent necessary or appropriate to the related Seller or its designee in the same manner, and pursuant to appropriate forms of assignment, substantially similar to the manner and forms pursuant to which documents were previously assigned to the Trustee, but in any event, without recourse, representation or warranty; provided that such tender by the Trustee and the Custodian shall be conditioned upon its receipt from the Master Servicer of a Request for Release.  The Master Servicer shall, and is hereby authorized and empowered by the Trustee to, prepare, execute and deliver in its own name, on behalf of the Certificateholders and the Trustee or any of them, the endorsements and assignments contemplated by this Section 2.3, and the Trustee shall execute and deliver any powers of attorney substantially in the form of Exhibit O-1 (or such other form as mutually agreed to by the Trustee and the Master Servicer) necessary to permit the Master Servicer to do so.  The Master Servicer shall, and is also hereby authorized and empowered by the Trustee to, reconvey to the related Seller any deposits then held in an Escrow Account relating to the Mortgage Loan being repurchased or substituted for.  The Master Servicer shall indemnify the Trustee for all costs, liabilities and expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by the Trustee in connection with any negligent or intentional misuse of any such powers of attorney by the Master Servicer.



 (c)           The Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreements provide the sole remedies available to the Certificateholders, or the Trustee on behalf of the Certificateholders, respecting any Material Document Defect or Material Breach.  The parties hereunder understand that (i) MSMCH, as Seller under Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement II, will be providing the remedies with respect to the MSMCH Loans, (ii) BANA, as Seller under Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement I, will be providing the remedies with respect to the BANA Loans, and (iii) CIBC, as Seller under Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement III, will be providing the remedies with respect to the CIBC Loans.







 (d)           The Master Servicer or the Special Servicer may enforce the provisions of this Section 2.3.



 (e)           If the Depositor, the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer (each a "Repurchase Request Recipient"):  (1) receives notice of a Demand; or (2) receives notice of a withdrawal of a Demand by the Person making such Demand, then such party shall give written notice thereof to the applicable Seller and the other parties hereto within ten (10) Business Days from the date of receipt of such notice.  Each notice required by this Section 2.3(e) (a "Rule 15Ga-1 Notice") shall include:  (i) the date the Demand was delivered to the Repurchase Request Recipient or was withdrawn by the Person making such Demand, as the case may be; (ii) the identity of the related Mortgage Loan and the identity of the Person making such Demand; (iii) the breach of representation or warranty or document deficiency asserted by the Person making the Demand, to the extent known to the Repurchase Request Recipient; and (iv) a statement from the Repurchase Request Recipient as to whether it currently plans to pursue such Demand.  Each Rule 15Ga-1 Notice may be delivered by electronic means.  A Repurchase Request Recipient shall not be required to provide any information under this Section 2.3(e) if and to the extent that such information is protected by either the attorney-client privilege or the attorney work product doctrines.  Each Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement will provide that (i) any Rule 15Ga-1 Notice is provided only to assist the Depositor, the related Seller and their respective Affiliates in complying with Rule 15Ga-1, Items 1104 and 1121 of Regulation AB and/or any other law or regulation, and (ii) (A) no action taken by, or inaction of, a Repurchase Request Recipient, and (B) no information provided pursuant to this Section 2.3(e) by a Repurchase Request Recipient, shall be deemed to constitute a waiver or defense to the exercise of any legal right the Repurchase Request Recipient may have with respect to the related Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement, including with respect to any Repurchase Request that is the subject of a Rule 15Ga-1 Notice



 If the Trustee, Custodian or the Certificate Administrator receives a Demand, then such party shall promptly (but in no event later than ten (10) calendar days following receipt by the Certificate Administrator, Custodian or the Trustee, as the case may be) forward such Demand to the Master Servicer, if relating to a Mortgage Loan that is not a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan or REO Mortgage Loan, or to the Special Servicer, if relating to a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan or an REO Mortgage Loan, and shall include the following statement in the related correspondence:  "This is a "Demand" under Section 2.3 of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement relating to the MSBAM 2013-C12 Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates requiring action by you as the "Repurchase Request Recipient" thereunder".  Upon receipt of a Demand by the Master Servicer or Special Servicer, as applicable, pursuant to the prior sentence, such party shall be deemed a Repurchase Request Recipient in respect of such Demand, and such party shall comply with the procedures set forth in the prior paragraph of this Section 2.3(e) with respect to such Demand.  None of the Trustee, the Custodian or the Certificate Administrator shall accept any oral Demands, and each of the Trustee, the Custodian and the Certificate Administrator shall direct any Person making a Demand to submit it in writing to the Certificate Administrator (who will then act in accordance with the first sentence of this paragraph).  Any Demand to the Certificate Administrator must be submitted in writing or by email to mmgrepurchases@wellsfargo.com (or such other email address as the Certificate Administrator shall designate from time to time) with a subject line of "Repurchase Request - MSBAM 2013-C12".

No Certificate shall be entitled to any benefit under this Agreement, or be valid for any purpose, unless there appears on such Certificate a certificate of authentication substantially in the form provided for herein, executed by an authorized officer of the Authenticating Agent by manual signature, and such certification upon any Certificate shall be conclusive evidence, and the only evidence, that such Certificate has been duly authenticated and delivered hereunder.  All Certificates shall be dated the date of their authentication.  At any time and from time to time after the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Depositor may deliver Certificates to the Authenticating Agent for authentication and the Authenticating Agent shall authenticate and deliver such Certificates only as provided for in this Agreement.  If additional Certificates need to be prepared at any time subsequent to the Closing Date, the Depositor shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, deliver, or cause to be delivered, at the Depositor's expense, any such additional







 Certificates.  With respect to the REMIC III Regular Certificates and Exchangeable Certificates that are issued in book-entry form, on the Closing Date, the Authenticating Agent upon the order of the Depositor shall authenticate Book-Entry Certificates that are issued to a Clearing Agency or its nominee as provided in Section 3.7 against payment of the purchase price thereof.  With respect to the Non-Registered Certificates that are issued in definitive form, on the Closing Date, the Authenticating Agent upon the order of the Depositor shall authenticate Definitive Certificates that are issued to the registered holder thereof against payment of the purchase price thereof.



 Section 3.2     Registration.  The Certificate Administrator shall be the initial Certificate Registrar in respect of the Certificates and the Certificate Registrar shall maintain books for the registration and for the transfer of Certificates (the "Certificate Register").  The Certificate Registrar may resign or be discharged or removed by the Certificate Administrator or the Certificateholders, and a new successor may be appointed, in accordance with the procedures and requirements set forth in Sections 7.6 and 7.7 hereof with respect to the resignation, discharge or removal of the Certificate Administrator and the appointment of a successor Certificate Administrator.  The Certificate Registrar may appoint, by a written instrument delivered to the Holders and the Trustee, any trust company to act as co-registrar under such conditions as the Certificate Registrar may prescribe; provided that the Certificate Registrar shall not be relieved of any of its duties or responsibilities hereunder by reason of such appointment.



 Section 3.3     Transfer and Exchange of Certificates.



 (a)           A Certificate may be transferred by the Holder thereof only upon presentation and surrender of such Certificate at the Corporate Trust Office of the Certificate Administrator, duly endorsed or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer duly executed by such Holder or such Holder's duly authorized attorney in such form as shall be satisfactory to the Certificate Registrar.  Upon the transfer of any Certificate in accordance with the preceding sentence, and subject to the restrictions set forth in the other subsections of this Section 3.3, the Certificate Registrar shall execute, and the Authenticating Agent shall authenticate and deliver to the transferee, one or more new Certificates of the same Class and evidencing, in the aggregate, the same aggregate initial Certificate Balance, initial Notional Amount or Percentage Interest, as the case may be, as the Certificate being transferred.  No service charge shall be made to a Certificateholder for any registration of transfer of Certificates, but the Certificate Registrar may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any registration or transfer of Certificates.  The Certificate Registrar may decline to accept any request for a registration of transfer of any Certificate during the period beginning five (5) calendar days prior to any Distribution Date.



 (b)           A Certificate may be exchanged by the Holder thereof for any number of new Certificates of the same Class, in authorized denominations, representing in the aggregate the same initial Certificate Balance, initial Notional Amount or Percentage Interest, as the case may be, as the Certificate surrendered, upon surrender of the Certificate to be exchanged at the offices of the Certificate Registrar duly endorsed or accompanied by a written instrument of exchange duly executed by such Holder or such Holder's duly authorized attorney in such form as is satisfactory to the Certificate Registrar.  Certificates delivered upon any such exchange will evidence the same obligations, and will be entitled to the same rights and privileges, as the







 Certificates surrendered.  No service charge shall be made to a Certificateholder for any exchange of Certificates, but the Certificate Registrar may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any exchange of Certificates.  Whenever any Certificates are so surrendered for exchange, the Certificate Registrar shall execute and the Authenticating Agent shall authenticate, date and deliver the Certificates which the Certificateholder making the exchange is entitled to receive.



 (c)           No transfer, sale, pledge or other disposition of any Non-Registered Certificate or interest therein shall be made unless such transfer, sale, pledge or other disposition is exempt from the registration and/or qualification requirements of the Securities Act and any applicable state securities laws, or is otherwise made in accordance with the Securities Act and such state securities laws.  If a transfer of any Non-Registered Certificate held as a Definitive Certificate is to be made without registration under the Securities Act (other than in connection with the initial issuance of the Certificates or a transfer of such Non-Registered Certificate by the Depositor or one of its Affiliates), then the Certificate Registrar shall refuse to register such transfer unless it receives (and upon receipt, may conclusively rely upon) either:  (i) a certificate from the Certificateholder desiring to effect such transfer substantially in the form attached as Exhibit D-1 hereto and a certificate from such Certificateholder's prospective Transferee substantially in the form attached either as Exhibit D-2A hereto or as Exhibit D-2B hereto; or (ii) an opinion of counsel satisfactory to the Certificate Registrar to the effect that such transfer shall be made without registration under the Securities Act, together with the written certification(s) as to the facts surrounding such transfer from the Certificateholder desiring to effect such transfer and/or such Certificateholder's prospective Transferee on which such opinion of counsel is based (which opinion of counsel shall not be an expense of the Trust or of the Depositor, the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Certificate Administrator, the Custodian, the Trustee, the Trust Advisor or the Certificate Registrar in their respective capacities as such).  No transfer of a Class R Certificate may be made in book-entry form or otherwise to a Person that is not a Qualified Institutional Buyer, and any certificate and/or opinion of counsel delivered pursuant to the preceding sentence must reflect that the Transferee of a Class R Certificate is a Qualified Institutional Buyer.  No Person may hold an interest in a Rule 144A Global Certificate unless that Person is a Qualified Institutional Buyer, and no "UxxPDSxxPD person" (as that term is defined in Rule 902(k) under the Securities Act) may hold an interest in a Regulation S Global Certificate, and transfers of interests in the Global Certificates that would result in a violation of the foregoing are prohibited.  No party to this Agreement is obligated to register or qualify any Class of Non-Registered Certificates under the Securities Act or any other securities law or to take any action not otherwise required under this Agreement to permit the transfer of any Certificate.  Any Certificateholder or Certificate Owner desiring to effect a transfer of Non-Registered Certificates or interests therein shall, and does hereby agree to, indemnify each Underwriter, each Initial Purchaser and each party to this Agreement against any liability that may result if the transfer is not exempt from such registration or qualification or is not made in accordance with such federal and state laws.



 (d)           No transfer of a Class R Certificate or other Non-Investment Grade Certificate or any interest therein shall be made (A) to any employee benefit plan or other retirement arrangement, including individual retirement accounts and annuities, Keogh plans and collective investment funds and separate accounts in which such plans, accounts or arrangements are invested, including, without limitation, insurance company general accounts, that is subject to







 Title I of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or any applicable federal, state or local law ("Similar Laws") materially similar to the foregoing provisions of ERISA or the Code (each, a "Plan"), or (B) to any Person who is directly or indirectly purchasing such Certificate or interest therein on behalf of, as named fiduciary of, as trustee of, or with "plan assets" of a Plan, unless:  (i) except in the case of a Class R Certificate, the purchase and holding of such Certificate or interest therein qualifies for the exemptive relief available under Sections I and III of UxxPDSxxPD Department of Labor Prohibited Transaction Class Exemption ("PTCE") 95-60; or (ii) in the case of a Non-Investment Grade Certificate (other than a Class R Certificate) held as a Definitive Certificate, the prospective Transferee provides the Certificate Registrar with a certification of facts and an Opinion of Counsel which establish to the satisfaction of the Certificate Registrar that such transfer will not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or subject any party to this Agreement to any obligation in addition to those undertaken in this Agreement.  Each Person who acquires any Class R Certificate or other Non-Investment Grade Certificate as a Definitive Certificate (unless it shall have acquired such Certificate from the Depositor or an Affiliate thereof or unless, in the case of a Non-Investment Grade Certificate (other than a Class R Certificate), it shall have delivered to the Certificate Registrar the certification of facts and Opinion of Counsel referred to in clause (ii) of the preceding sentence) shall be required to deliver to the Certificate Registrar a certification in the form of Exhibit D-2A or Exhibit D-2B hereto that includes a certification to the effect that:  (i) it is neither a Plan nor any Person who is directly or indirectly purchasing such Certificate or interest therein on behalf of, as named fiduciary of, as trustee of, or with "plan assets" of a Plan; or (ii) that, except in the case of a Class R Certificate, the purchase and holding of such Certificate or interest therein by such Person qualifies for the exemptive relief available under Sections I and III of PTCE 95-60 or another exemption from the "prohibited transactions" rules under ERISA issued by the UxxPDSxxPD Department of Labor or similar exemption under Similar Laws.



 (e)           Each Person who has or who acquires any Ownership Interest in a Class R Certificate shall be deemed by the acceptance or acquisition of such Ownership Interest to have agreed to be bound by the following provisions and to have irrevocably authorized the Certificate Administrator under clause (F) below to deliver payments to a Person other than such Person and to have irrevocably authorized the Certificate Registrar under clause (G) below to negotiate the terms of any mandatory sale and to execute all instruments of Transfer and to do all other things necessary in connection with any such sale.  The rights of such person acquiring any Ownership Interest in a Class R Certificate are expressly subject to the following provisions:



 (A)           (1) Each Person holding or acquiring any Ownership Interest in a Class R Certificate shall be a Permitted Transferee and a United States Tax Person other than a partnership (including any entity treated as a partnership for UxxPDSxxPD federal income tax purposes) any interest in which is owned (or, may be owned pursuant to the applicable partnership agreement) directly or indirectly (other than through a UxxPDSxxPD corporation) by any person that is not a United States Tax Person, and shall promptly notify the Certificate Registrar of any change or impending change in its status as a Permitted Transferee and (2) each Person holding or acquiring any Ownership Interest in a Class R Certificate shall be a Qualified Institutional Buyer and shall promptly notify the Certificate Registrar of any change or impending change in its status as a Qualified Institutional Buyer.







 (B)           In connection with any proposed Transfer of any Ownership Interest in a Class R Certificate, the Certificate Registrar shall require delivery to it, and no Transfer of any Class R Certificate shall be registered until the Certificate Registrar receives, an affidavit and agreement substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit E-1 (a "Transferee Affidavit and Agreement") from the proposed Transferee, in form and substance satisfactory to the Certificate Registrar, representing and warranting, among other things, that such Transferee is a Permitted Transferee, that it is a Qualified Institutional Buyer, that it is not acquiring its Ownership Interest in the Class R Certificate that is the subject of the proposed Transfer as a nominee, trustee or agent for any Person that is not a Permitted Transferee, that for so long as it retains its Ownership Interest in a Class R Certificate, it will endeavor to remain a Permitted Transferee, that it is a United States Tax Person other than a partnership (including any entity treated as a partnership for UxxPDSxxPD federal income tax purposes) any interest in which is owned (or, may be owned pursuant to the applicable partnership agreement) directly or indirectly (other than through a UxxPDSxxPD corporation) by any person that is not a United States Tax Person, that if such Transferee is a partnership, trust or disregarded entity for UxxPDSxxPD federal income tax purposes, then each Person that may be allocated income from a Class R Certificate is a United States Tax Person, that it is not a foreign permanent establishment or fixed base, within the meaning of any applicable income tax treaty, of any United States Tax Person, that it has historically paid its debts as they have come due and will continue to do so in the future, that it understands that its tax liability with respect to the Class R Certificates may exceed cash flows thereon and it intends to pay such taxes as they come due, that it will not cause income with respect to the Class R Certificates to be attributable to a foreign permanent establishment or fixed base, within the meaning of any applicable income tax treaty, of such proposed Transferee or any other United States Tax Person, that it will provide the Certificate Registrar with all information necessary to determine that the applicable paragraphs of Section 13 of such Transferee Affidavit and Agreement are true or that Section 13 is not applicable, and that it has reviewed the provisions of this Section 3.3(e) and agrees to be bound by them.



 (C)           Notwithstanding the delivery of a Transferee Affidavit and Agreement by a proposed Transferee under clause (B) above, if a Responsible Officer of the Certificate Registrar has actual knowledge that the proposed Transferee is not a Permitted Transferee or is not a United States Tax Person, no Transfer of an Ownership Interest in a Class R Certificate to such proposed Transferee shall be effected.



 (D)           Each Person holding or acquiring an Ownership Interest in a Class R Certificate shall agree (1) to require a Transferee Affidavit and Agreement from any prospective Transferee to whom such Person attempts to transfer its Ownership Interest in such Class R Certificate and (2) not to transfer its Ownership Interest in such Class R Certificate unless it provides to the Certificate Registrar a certificate substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit E-2 stating, among other things that (x) it has conducted a reasonable investigation of the financial condition of the proposed Transferee and, as a result of the investigation, the Transferor determines that the proposed Transferee had historically paid its debts as they came due and found no significant evidence that the proposed Transferee will not continue to pay its debts as they come due in the future and, (y) it has no actual knowledge that such prospective Transferee is not a Permitted







 Transferee, is not a United States Tax Person or a partnership (including any entity treated as a partnership for UxxPDSxxPD federal income tax purposes) any interest in which is owned (or, may be owned pursuant to the applicable partnership agreement) directly or indirectly (other than through a UxxPDSxxPD corporation) by any person that is not a United States Tax Person, is a foreign permanent establishment or fixed base, within the meaning of any applicable income tax treaty, of any United States Tax Person or is a Person with respect to which income on the Class R Certificate is attributable to a foreign permanent establishment or fixed base, within the meaning of any applicable income tax treaty.



 (E)           Each Person holding or acquiring an Ownership Interest in a Class R Certificate that is a "pass-through interest holder" within the meaning of temporary Treasury Regulations Section 1.67-3T(a)(2)(i)(A) or is holding an Ownership Interest in a Class R Certificate on behalf of a "pass-through interest holder", by purchasing an Ownership Interest in such Certificate, agrees to give the Certificate Registrar written notice of its status as such immediately upon holding or acquiring such Ownership Interest in a Class R Certificate.



 (F)           If any purported Transferee shall become a Holder of a Class R Certificate in violation of the provisions of this Section 3.3(e) or if any Holder of a Class R Certificate shall lose its status as a Permitted Transferee or a United States Tax Person, then the last preceding Holder of such Class R Certificate that was in compliance with the provisions of this Section 3.3(e) shall be restored, to the extent permitted by law, to all rights and obligations as Holder thereof retroactive to the date of registration of such Transfer of such Class R Certificate.  None of the Trustee, the Custodian, the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Trust Advisor, the Certificate Registrar or the Certificate Administrator shall be under any liability to any Person for any registration of Transfer of a Class R Certificate that is in fact not permitted by this Section 3.3(e) or for making any payments due on such Certificate to the Holder thereof or for taking any other action with respect to such Holder under the provisions of this Agreement.



 (G)           If any purported Transferee shall become a Holder of a Class R Certificate in violation of the restrictions in this Section 3.3(e), or if any Holder of a Class R Certificate shall lose its status as a Permitted Transferee or a United States Tax Person, and to the extent that the retroactive restoration of the rights and obligations of the prior Holder of such Class R Certificate as set forth in clause (F) above shall be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, then the Certificate Registrar shall have the right, without notice to the Holder or any prior Holder of such Class R Certificate, but not the obligation, to sell or cause to be sold such Class R Certificate to a purchaser selected by the Certificate Registrar on such terms as the Certificate Registrar may choose.  Such noncomplying Holder shall promptly endorse and deliver such Class R Certificate in accordance with the instructions of the Certificate Registrar.  Such purchaser may be the Certificate Registrar itself or any Affiliate of the Certificate Registrar.  The proceeds of such sale, net of the commissions (which may include commissions payable to the Certificate Registrar or its Affiliates), expenses and taxes due, if any, will be remitted by the Certificate Registrar to such noncomplying Holder.  The terms and conditions of any sale under this clause (G) shall be determined in the sole discretion of the Certificate







 Registrar, and the Certificate Registrar shall not be liable to any Person having an Ownership Interest in a Class R Certificate as a result of its exercise of such discretion.



 The Certificate Administrator shall make available to the Internal Revenue Service and those Persons specified by the REMIC Provisions, all information in its possession necessary to compute any tax imposed (i) as a result of the Transfer of an Ownership Interest in a Class R Certificate to any Person who is not a Permitted Transferee, including the information described in Treasury Regulations Sections 1.860D-1(b)(5) and 1.860E-2(a)(5) with respect to the "excess inclusions" of such Class R Certificate and (ii) as a result of any regulated investment company, real estate investment trust, common trust fund, partnership, trust, estate or organization described in Section 1381 of the Code that holds an Ownership Interest in a Class R Certificate having as among its record holders at any time any Person which is not a Permitted Transferee.  The Person holding such Ownership Interest shall be responsible for the reasonable compensation of the Master Servicer and the Certificate Administrator for providing such information.



 The provisions of this Section 3.3(e) may be modified, added to or eliminated, provided that there shall have been delivered to the Trustee, the Custodian, the Certificate Administrator, the Certificate Registrar, the Master Servicer and the Depositor, an Opinion of Counsel (subject to Section 5.7, a copy of which shall be provided to each Rating Agency), in form and substance satisfactory to the Trustee, the Certificate Registrar and the Depositor, to the effect that such modification of, addition to or elimination of such provisions will not cause any REMIC Pool to (A) cease to qualify as a REMIC or (B) be subject to an entity-level tax caused by the Transfer of any Class R Certificate to a Person which is not a Permitted Transferee, or cause a Person other than the prospective Transferee to be subject to a tax caused by the Transfer of a Class R Certificate to a Person which is not a Permitted Transferee.



 (f)           None of the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Trust Advisor, the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator, the Custodian or the Certificate Registrar shall have any liability to the Trust arising from a transfer of any Certificate in reliance upon a certification, ruling or opinion of counsel described in this Section 3.3; provided, that the Certificate Registrar shall not register the transfer of a Class R Certificate if it has actual knowledge that the proposed transferee does not meet the qualifications of a permitted Holder of a Class R Certificate as set forth in Section 3.3(e); provided, further, that the Certificate Registrar shall not register the transfer of a Class R Certificate if it shall have received notice that the Transferor has determined, as a result of the investigation under Section 3.3(e)(D), that the proposed Transferee has not paid its debts as they came due or that it will not pay its debts as they come due in the future.  The Certificate Registrar shall have no obligation or duty to monitor, determine or inquire as to compliance with any restriction on transfer or exchange of Certificates or any interest therein imposed under this Article III or under applicable law other than to require delivery of the certifications and/or opinions described in this Article III; provided, that the Certificate Registrar shall not register the transfer of a Class R Certificate if it has actual knowledge that the proposed transferee does not meet the qualifications of a permitted Holder of a Class R Certificate as set forth in Section 3.3(e).  The Certificate Registrar shall have no liability for transfers (including without limitation transfers made through the book-entry facilities of the Depository or between or among Participants or Certificate Owners) made in







 violation of applicable restrictions, provided that the Certificate Registrar has satisfied its duties expressly set forth in Sections 3.3(c), 3.3(d) and 3.3(e).



 (g)           All Certificates surrendered for transfer and exchange shall be physically cancelled by the Certificate Registrar, and the Certificate Registrar shall hold such cancelled Certificates in accordance with its standard procedures.



 (h)           The Certificate Registrar shall provide the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer and the Depositor, upon written request, with an updated copy of the Certificate Register within a reasonable period of time following receipt of such request.



 (i)           Unless and until it is exchanged in whole for the individual Certificates represented thereby, a Global Certificate representing all of the Certificates of a Class may not be transferred, except as a whole by the Depository to a nominee of the Depository or by a nominee of the Depository to the Depository or another nominee of the Depository or by the Depository or any such nominee to a successor Clearing Agency or a nominee of such successor Clearing Agency, and no such transfer to any such other Person may be registered; provided that this subsection (i) shall not prohibit any transfer of a Certificate of a Class that is issued in exchange for a Global Certificate of the same Class pursuant to Section 3.9 below.  Nothing in this subsection (i) shall prohibit or render ineffective any transfer of a beneficial interest in a Global Certificate effected in accordance with the other provisions of this Section 3.3.



 Section 3.4     Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost or Stolen Certificates.  If (A) any mutilated Certificate is surrendered to the Certificate Registrar, or the Certificate Registrar receives evidence to its satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Certificate and (B) except in the case of a mutilated Certificate so surrendered, there is delivered to the Certificate Registrar such security or indemnity as may be required by it to save it harmless, then, in the absence of notice to the Certificate Registrar that such Certificate has been acquired by a bona fide purchaser, the Certificate Registrar shall execute, and the Authenticating Agent shall authenticate and deliver, in exchange for or in lieu of any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Certificate, a new Certificate of like tenor and interest in the Trust.  In connection with the issuance of any new Certificate under this Section 3.4, the Certificate Registrar may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Certificate Registrar) connected therewith.  Any replacement Certificate issued pursuant to this Section 3.4 shall constitute complete and indefeasible evidence of ownership in the Trust, as if originally issued, whether or not the lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate shall be found at any time.



 Section 3.5     Persons Deemed Owners.  Prior to presentation of a Certificate for registration of transfer, the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Trustee, the Custodian, the Trust Advisor, the Certificate Administrator and any agent of any such party, may treat the Person in whose name any Certificate is registered as of the related Record Date as the owner of such Certificate for the purpose of receiving distributions as provided in this Agreement and for all other purposes whatsoever, and no such party (nor any agent thereof) shall be affected by any notice to the contrary.







 Section 3.6     Access to List of Certificateholders' Names and Addresses.



 (a)           If any three (3) or more Certifying Certificateholders or any party to this Agreement (i) request in writing from the Certificate Registrar a list of the names and addresses of Certificateholders and (ii) in the case of a request by Certificateholders, state that such Certificateholders desire to communicate with other Certificateholders with respect to their rights under this Agreement or under the Certificates, then the Certificate Registrar shall, within ten (10) Business Days after the receipt of such request, at no cost to such requesting party, afford such Certificateholders or applicable party to this Agreement, as applicable, access during normal business hours to a current list of the Certificateholders or, if requested, shall provide such list electronically to the applicable requesting party; provided, that the Certificate Registrar shall not be required to determine the identity of any Certificate Owner of any Book-Entry Certificate.  Every Certificateholder, by receiving and holding a Certificate, agrees that none of the Certificate Registrar or any other party to this Agreement shall be held accountable by reason of the disclosure of any such information as to the list of the Certificateholders hereunder, regardless of the source from which such information was derived.



 (b)           Upon the written request of any Certifying Certificateholder that (i) states that such Certificateholder desires the Certificate Registrar to transmit a notice to all Certificateholders stating that such Certificateholder wishes to be contacted by other Certificateholders, setting forth the relevant contact information and briefly stating the reason for the requested contact and (ii) provides a copy of the Special Notice which such Certificateholder proposes to transmit, the Certificate Registrar shall deliver such Special Notice to the Certificate Administrator, who shall make a copy of such Special Notice available electronically on the Certificate Administrator's Website pursuant to Section 5.4.  The costs and expenses of the Certificate Registrar associated with delivering any such Special Notice shall be borne by the party or parties requesting delivery of such Special Notice.  Every Certificateholder, by receiving and holding a Certificate, agrees that the Certificate Registrar shall not be held accountable by reason of the disclosure of any such Special Notice to Certificateholders, regardless of the information set forth in such Special Notice.



 Section 3.7                      Book-Entry Certificates.



 (a)           The REMIC III Regular Certificates and Exchangeable Certificates (exclusive of any Non-Registered Certificates that are sold in the United States to Institutional Accredited Investors that are not Qualified Institutional Buyers), in the case of each Class thereof, upon original issuance, shall be issued in the form of one or more Global Certificates representing the Book-Entry Certificates of such Class, to be delivered to the Certificate Registrar, as custodian for the Depository, the initial Clearing Agency, by, or on behalf of, the Depositor, provided, that any Non-Registered Certificates sold to Institutional Accredited Investors that are not Qualified Institutional Buyers, together with the Class R Certificates, will be issued as Definitive Certificates.  The Global Certificates shall initially be registered on the Certificate Register in the name of Cede & Co., the nominee of the Depository, as the initial Clearing Agency, and no Certificate Owner will receive a Definitive Certificate representing such Certificate Owner's interest in the Global Certificates, except as provided in Section 3.9.  With respect to those Classes of Certificates issued as Global Certificates, unless and until Definitive Certificates have been issued to the related Certificate Owners pursuant to Section 3.9:







 (i)          the provisions of this Section 3.7 shall be in full force and effect with respect to each such Class;



 (ii)         the Depositor, the Master Servicer, the Certificate Administrator, the Certificate Registrar, the Custodian and the Trustee may deal with the Clearing Agency for all purposes (including the making of distributions on the Certificates) as the authorized representative of the Certificate Owners;



 (iii)        to the extent that the provisions of this Section 3.7 conflict with any other provisions of this Agreement, the provisions of this Section 3.7 shall control with respect to each such Class; and



 (iv)        the rights of the Certificate Owners of each such Class shall be exercised only through the Clearing Agency and the applicable Participants and shall be limited to those established by law and agreements between such Certificate Owners and the Clearing Agency and/or the Participants.  Pursuant to the Depository Agreement, unless and until Certificates are issued pursuant to Section 3.9, the initial Clearing Agency will make book-entry transfers among the Participants and receive and transmit distributions of principal and interest on the related Certificates to such Participants.



 (b)           For purposes of any provision of this Agreement requiring or permitting actions with the consent of, or at the direction of, Holders of the Certificates evidencing a specified percentage of the aggregate unpaid principal amount of Certificates, such direction or consent may be given by the Clearing Agency at the direction of Certificate Owners owning Certificates evidencing the requisite percentage of principal amount of Certificates.  The Clearing Agency may take conflicting actions with respect to the Certificates to the extent that such actions are taken on behalf of the Certificate Owners.



 (c)           The Certificates of each Class of Non-Registered Certificates (other than the Class R Certificates) initially sold in reliance on Rule 144A shall be represented by the Rule 144A Global Certificate for such Class, which shall be deposited with the Certificate Registrar, as custodian for the Depository and registered in the name of Cede & Co. as nominee of the Depository.  The Non-Registered Certificates initially sold to Institutional Accredited Investors that are not Qualified Institutional Buyers, together with the Class R Certificates, shall be represented by Definitive Certificates for such Class.  The Non-Registered Certificates evidenced by any Rule 144A Global Certificate or Definitive Certificate shall be subject to certain restrictions on transfer as set forth in Section 3.3 hereof and shall bear legend(s) regarding such restrictions described herein.



 (d)           The Certificates of each Class of Non-Registered Certificates (other than the Class R Certificates) initially sold in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S shall be represented by the Regulation S Temporary Global Certificate for such Class, which shall be deposited with the Certificate Registrar, as custodian for the Depository and registered in the name of Cede & Co. as nominee of the Depository.  Not earlier than the Release Date, beneficial interests in any Regulation S Temporary Global Certificate shall be exchangeable for beneficial interests in the Regulation S Permanent Global Certificate for such Class.  Beneficial interests in any Regulation S Temporary Global Certificate may be held only through Euroclear Bank or







 Clearstream Bank; provided, that such interests may be exchanged for interests in the Rule 144A Global Certificate for such Class in accordance with the certification requirements described in Section 3.7(f).  The Regulation S Permanent Global Certificates shall be deposited with the Certificate Registrar, as custodian for the Depository and registered in the name of Cede & Co. as nominee of the Depository.



 On or prior to the Release Date and on or prior to any Distribution Date occurring prior to the Release Date, each Certificate Owner of a Regulation S Temporary Global Certificate that holds a beneficial interest therein on the Release Date or on any such Distribution Date, as the case may be, must deliver to Euroclear Bank or Clearstream Bank (as applicable) a Regulation S Certificate; provided, that any Certificate Owner that holds a beneficial interest in a Regulation S Temporary Global Certificate on the Release Date or on any such Distribution Date that has previously delivered a Regulation S Certificate to Euroclear Bank or Clearstream Bank with respect to its interest therein does not need to deliver any subsequent Regulation S Certificate (unless the certificate previously delivered is no longer true as of such subsequent date, and such Certificate Owner must promptly notify Euroclear Bank or Clearstream Bank, as applicable, thereof).  Euroclear Bank or Clearstream Bank, as applicable, shall be required to promptly deliver to the Certificate Registrar a certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit H hereto to the effect that it has received the requisite Regulation S Certificates for each such Class, and no Certificate Owner (or transferee from any such Certificate Owner) shall be entitled to receive an interest in the Regulation S Permanent Global Certificate for such Class or any payment or principal or interest with respect to its interest in such Regulation S Temporary Global Certificate prior to the Certificate Registrar receiving such certification from Euroclear Bank or Clearstream Bank with respect to the portion of the Regulation S Temporary Global Certificate owned by such Certificate Owner (and, with respect to an interest in the applicable Regulation S Permanent Global Certificate, prior to the Release Date).  After the Release Date, distributions due with respect to any beneficial interest in a Regulation S Temporary Global Certificate shall not be made to the holders of such beneficial interests unless exchange for a beneficial interest in the related Regulation S Permanent Global Certificate is improperly withheld or refused.  No interest in a Regulation S Global Certificate may be held by or transferred to a UxxPDSxxPD Person (as defined in Regulation S) except for exchanges for a beneficial interest in the Rule 144A Global Certificate for such Class as set forth in Section 3.7(f).



 (e)           Except in the limited circumstances described below in Section 3.9, owners of beneficial interests in Global Certificates shall not be entitled to receive physical delivery of Definitive Certificates.  The Certificates are not issuable in bearer form.  Upon the issuance of each Global Certificate, the Depository or its custodian shall credit, on its internal system, the respective principal amount of the individual beneficial interests represented by such Global Certificate to the accounts of Persons who have accounts with such Depository.  Such accounts initially shall be designated by or on behalf of the Underwriters and the Initial Purchasers.  Ownership of beneficial interests in a Global Certificate shall be limited to Customers or Persons who hold interests directly or indirectly through Customers.  Ownership of beneficial interests in the Global Certificates shall be shown on, and the transfer of that ownership shall be effected only through, records maintained by the Depository or its nominee (with respect to interests of Customers) and the records of Customers (with respect to interests of Persons other than Customers).







 So long as the Depository, or its nominee, is the registered holder of a Global Certificate, the Depository or such nominee, as the case may be, shall be considered the sole owner and holder of the Certificates represented by such Global Certificate for all purposes under this Agreement and the Certificates, including, without limitation, obtaining consents and waivers thereunder, and the Trustee, the Custodian, the Certificate Administrator and the Certificate Registrar shall not be affected by any notice to the contrary.  Except under the circumstance described in Section 3.9, owners of beneficial interests in a Global Certificate will not be entitled to have any portions of such Global Certificate registered in their names, will not receive or be entitled to receive physical delivery of Definitive Certificates in certificated form and shall not be considered the owners or holders of the Global Certificate (or any Certificates represented thereby) under this Agreement or the Certificates.  In addition, no Certificate Owner of an interest in a Global Certificate shall be able to transfer that interest except in accordance with the Depository's applicable procedures (in addition to those under this Agreement and, if applicable, those of Euroclear Bank and Clearstream Bank).



 (f)           Any holder of an interest in a Regulation S Global Certificate shall have the right, upon prior written notice to the Certificate Registrar, Euroclear Bank or Clearstream Bank, as applicable, and the Depository, in the form of an Exchange Certification (substantially in the form of Exhibit G attached hereto), to exchange all or a portion of such interest (in authorized denominations as set forth in Section 3.1(b)) for an equivalent interest in the Rule 144A Global Certificate for such Class in connection with a transfer of its interest therein to a transferee that is eligible to hold an interest in such Rule 144A Global Certificate as set forth herein; provided that no Exchange Certification shall be required if any such exchange occurs after the Release Date.  Any holder of an interest in the Rule 144A Global Certificate shall have the right, upon prior written notice to the Certificate Registrar, the Depository and Euroclear Bank or Clearstream Bank, as applicable, in the form of an Exchange Certification (substantially in the form of Exhibit G attached hereto), to exchange all or a portion of such interest (in authorized denominations as set forth in Section 3.1(b)) for an equivalent interest in the Regulation S Global Certificate for such Class in connection with a transfer of its interest therein to a transferee that is eligible to hold an interest in such Regulation S Global Certificate as set forth herein; provided, that if such exchange occurs prior to the Release Date, the transferee shall acquire an interest in a Regulation S Temporary Global Certificate only and shall be subject to all of the restrictions associated therewith described in Section 3.7(d).  Following receipt of any Exchange Certification or request for transfer, as applicable, by the Certificate Registrar:  (i) the Certificate Registrar shall endorse the schedule to any Global Certificate representing the Certificate or Certificates being exchanged to reduce the stated principal amount of such Global Certificate by the denominations of the Certificate or Certificates for which such exchange is to be made, and (ii) the Certificate Registrar shall endorse the schedule to any Global Certificate representing the Certificate or Certificates for which such exchange is to be made to increase the stated principal amount of such Global Certificate by the denominations of the Certificate or Certificates being exchanged therefor.  The form of the Exchange Certification shall be available from the Certificate Registrar.



 (g)           If a Holder of a Definitive Certificate wishes at any time to exchange such Definitive Certificate for an interest in the Rule 144A Global Certificate of the same Class, or to transfer such Definitive Certificate to a Person who is entitled to take delivery thereof in the form of an interest in the Rule 144A Global Certificate of the same Class, such Holder may, subject to







 the rules and procedures of the Depository, cause the exchange of such Definitive Certificate for an equivalent beneficial interest in the Rule 144A Global Certificate of the same Class; provided that such Holder shall pay all reasonable costs and expenses associated therewith.  Upon receipt by the Certificate Registrar, as registrar, at its Corporate Trust Office, of (1) such Definitive Certificate, duly endorsed as provided herein, (2) instructions from such Holder directing the Certificate Registrar, as registrar, to credit, or cause to be credited, a beneficial interest in the applicable Rule 144A Global Certificate equal to the Certificate Balance of the Definitive Certificate to be exchanged or transferred, such instructions to contain information regarding the participant account with the Depository to be credited with such increase, and (3) a certificate in the form of Exhibit D-3 hereto, then the Certificate Registrar, as registrar, shall cancel or cause the cancellation of such Definitive Certificate and shall instruct the Depository to increase, or cause to be increased, the Certificate Balance of the applicable Rule 144A Global Certificate by the aggregate Certificate Balance of the Definitive Certificate to be exchanged or transferred and to credit, or cause to be credited, to the account of the Person specified in such instructions a beneficial interest in the applicable Rule 144A Global Certificate equal to the Certificate Balance of the Definitive Certificate so canceled.



 Section 3.8     Notices to Clearing Agency.  Whenever notice or other communication to the Certificateholders is required under this Agreement, unless and until Definitive Certificates shall have been issued to the related Certificateholders pursuant to Section 3.9, the Certificate Administrator shall give all such notices and communications specified herein to be given to Holders of the Book-Entry Certificates to the Clearing Agency which shall give such notices and communications to the related Participants in accordance with its applicable rules, regulations and procedures.



 Section 3.9      Definitive Certificates.



 (a)           Definitive Certificates will be issued to the owners of beneficial interests in a Global Certificate or their nominees if (i) the Clearing Agency notifies the Depositor and the Certificate Registrar in writing that the Clearing Agency is unwilling or unable to continue as depositary for such Global Certificate and a qualifying successor depositary is not appointed by the Depositor within ninety (90) days thereof or (ii) the Trustee has instituted or caused to be instituted or has been directed to institute any judicial proceeding in a court to enforce the rights of the Certificateholders under this Agreement and under such Global Certificate and the Trustee has been advised by counsel that in connection with such proceeding it is necessary or advisable for the Trustee or its custodian to obtain possession of such Global Certificate; provided, that under no circumstances will Definitive Certificates be issued to Certificate Owners of the Regulation S Temporary Global Certificate.  Upon notice of the occurrence of any of the events described in the preceding sentence, the Certificate Registrar shall notify the Clearing Agency and request the Clearing Agency to notify all Certificate Owners, through the applicable Participants, of the occurrence of the event and of the availability of Definitive Certificates to such Certificate Owners requesting the same.  Upon surrender to the Certificate Registrar of the Global Certificates by the Clearing Agency, accompanied by registration instructions from the Clearing Agency for registration, the Certificate Registrar shall execute, and the Authenticating Agent shall authenticate and deliver, the Definitive Certificates.  None of the Depositor, the Trustee, the Custodian, the Certificate Administrator or the Certificate Registrar shall be liable for any delay in delivery of such instructions and may conclusively rely on, and shall be







 protected in relying on, such instructions.  Upon the issuance of Definitive Certificates, all references herein to obligations imposed upon or to be performed by the Clearing Agency shall be deemed to be imposed upon and performed by the Certificate Registrar, to the extent applicable with respect to such Definitive Certificates, and the Certificate Registrar and the Trustee and the Certificate Administrator shall recognize the Holders of Definitive Certificates as Certificateholders hereunder.



 (b)           If any Certificate Owner wishes to transfer its interest in a Rule 144A Global Certificate to an Institutional Accredited Investor that is not a Qualified Institutional Buyer, or wishes to transfer its interest in a Regulation S Global Certificate to a "UxxPDSxxPD person" (as that term is defined in Rule 902(k) under the Securities Act) that is an Institutional Accredited Investor but not a Qualified Institutional Buyer, then the transferee shall take delivery in the form of a Definitive Certificate, subject to the restrictions on the transfer of such Definitive Certificate in Section 3.3.  No such transfer shall be made and the Certificate Registrar shall not register any such transfer unless such transfer complies with the provisions of Section 3.3 applicable to transfers of Definitive Certificates.  Upon acceptance for exchange or transfer of a beneficial interest in a Global Certificate for a Definitive Certificate, as provided herein, the Certificate Registrar shall endorse on the schedule affixed to the related Global Certificate (or on a continuation of such schedule affixed to such Global Certificate and made a part thereof) an appropriate notation evidencing the date of such exchange or transfer and a decrease in the denomination of such Global Certificate equal to the denomination of such Definitive Certificate issued in exchange therefor or upon transfer thereof.



 (c)           Distributions of principal and interest on the Definitive Certificates shall be made by the Certificate Administrator directly to holders of Definitive Certificates in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Agreement.



 Section 3.10     Exchanges of Exchangeable Certificates.



 (a)           On the Closing Date, the Grantor Trust shall issue the several Classes of Exchangeable Certificates.  Each Class of Exchangeable Certificates shall be issued on the Closing Date with the respective Aggregate Certificate Balance set forth in the Preliminary Statement hereto.



 (b)           At the request of the Holder of Class A-S, Class B and Class C Certificates in the Exchange Proportion, and upon the surrender of such Exchangeable Certificates, the Certificate Administrator shall exchange such Exchangeable Certificates for Class PST Certificates with an original Aggregate Certificate Balance equal to the original Aggregate Certificate Balance of the Class A-S, Class B and Class C Certificates exchanged therefor.  At the request of the Holder of Class PST Certificates, and upon the surrender of such Exchangeable Certificates, the Certificate Administrator shall exchange such Exchangeable Certificates for Class A-S, Class B and Class C Certificates in the Exchange Proportion and with an original Aggregate Certificate Balance equal to the original Aggregate Certificate Balance of the Class PST Certificates exchanged therefor.  No service charge (other than administrative fees charged by the Depository) shall be payable by a Certificateholder in connection with any exchange of Certificates pursuant to this Section 3.10.  There shall be no limitation on the number of exchanges authorized pursuant to this Section 3.10; provided, that (i) each of the







 Class A-S, Class B and Class C Certificates exchanged (whether surrendered or received) in such exchange shall have denominations no smaller than the minimum denominations set forth in Section 3.1 and (ii) exchanges pursuant to this Section 3.10 shall not be permitted after the Certificate Balance of the Class A-S REMIC III Regular Interest (and therefore the Aggregate Certificate Balance of the Class A-S Certificates and the Class PST Component A-S Principal Amount of the Class PST Component A-S) has been reduced to zero or if any Class of Exchangeable Certificates is no longer maintained as a Book-Entry Certificate.   In addition, the Depositor shall have the right to make or cause exchanges on the Closing Date pursuant to instructions delivered to the Certificate Administrator on the Closing Date.



 (c)           [Reserved].



 (d)           In connection with any exchange of Exchangeable Certificates, the Certificate Registrar shall reduce the outstanding Aggregate Certificate Balance of such Class or Classes of Exchangeable Certificates surrendered by the applicable Holder on the Certificate Register and shall increase the outstanding Aggregate Certificate Balance of the related Class or Classes of Exchangeable Certificates received by such Holder in such exchange on the Certificate Register and the Certificate Registrar or the Certificate Administrator, as applicable, shall give appropriate instructions to the Depository and make appropriate notations on the Registered Global Certificate for each Class of Exchangeable Certificates to reflect such reductions and increases.



 (e)           In order to effect an exchange of Exchangeable Certificates, the Certificateholder shall notify the Certificate Administrator in writing or by e-mail to cts.cmbs.bond.admin@wellsfargo.com (with a subject line referencing "MSBAM 2013-C12" and setting forth the proposed Exchange Date) no later than three (3) Business Days before the proposed exchange date (the "Exchange Date").  The Exchange Date may be any Business Day other than the first or last Business Day of the month.  The notice must (i) be set forth on the applicable Certificateholder's letterhead, (ii) carry a medallion stamp guarantee and (iii) set forth the following information: the CUSIP number of each Exchangeable Certificate to be exchanged and each Exchangeable Certificate to be received; the outstanding Certificate Balance and the initial Certificate Balance of the Exchangeable Certificates to be exchanged, the Certificateholder's DTC participant number; and the proposed Exchange Date.  The Certificateholder and the Certificate Administrator shall utilize the "deposit and withdrawal system" at the Depository to effect such exchange of the applicable Exchangeable Certificates. A notice shall become irrevocable on the second Business Day before the proposed Exchange Date.  Exchangeable Certificates shall be exchangeable on the books of the Depository for the corresponding Exchangeable Certificates on and after the Closing Date, by notice to the Certificate Administrator substantially in the form of Exhibit Q.



 (f)           The Certificate Administrator shall make the first distribution on an Exchangeable  Certificate received by a Certificateholder in any exchange on the Distribution Date in the month following the month of exchange to the Certificateholder of record as of the applicable Record Date for such Certificate and Distribution Date.  If an Exchange Date occurs in any month before the Distribution Date in such month, then any distributions to be made on such Distribution Date on any Certificates surrendered in the exchange shall be so made to the Certificateholder of record as of the applicable Record Date for such Certificates and such







 Distribution Date.  Neither the Certificate Administrator nor the Depositor will have any obligation to ensure the availability in the market of the applicable Certificates to accomplish any exchange.



 ARTICLE IV

 ADVANCES



 Advances shall be made as provided herein by the Master Servicer and, if the Master Servicer does not make such Advances, by the Trustee except to the extent that the Master Servicer or the Trustee, as applicable, determines in accordance with Section 4.4 below, that any such Advance would be a Nonrecoverable Advance.



 Section 4.1     P&I Advances by Master Servicer.



 (a)           On or prior to the Advance Report Date, the Master Servicer shall notify the Trustee and the Certificate Administrator if the P&I Advance Amount for such Distribution Date is greater than zero (provided that such notice shall be deemed given if the Master Servicer complies with its obligations under Section 8.11(a) or Section 8.11(d)(v)), and the Master Servicer shall make a P&I Advance in respect of each applicable Mortgage Loan of such amount no later than the Master Servicer Remittance Date.  It is understood that the obligation of the Master Servicer to make such P&I Advances is mandatory and shall apply through any court appointed stay period or similar payment delay resulting from any insolvency of the Mortgagor or related bankruptcy, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Master Servicer shall not be required to make such P&I Advance if the Master Servicer determines, in accordance with Section 4.4 below, that any such P&I Advance would be a Nonrecoverable Advance and shall not make such P&I Advance if such P&I Advance if made would be a Nonrecoverable Advance as determined by the Special Servicer in accordance with the Servicing Standard, in which event the Special Servicer shall promptly direct the Master Servicer not to make such P&I Advance; provided that the Special Servicer has no obligation to make such determination.  Such determination shall be conclusive and binding on the Trustee and the Certificateholders.  The Special Servicer shall not make P&I Advances under this Agreement.  If the Master Servicer fails to make a P&I Advance that it is required to make under this Section 4.1, it shall promptly notify the Trustee and the Certificate Administrator of such failure.



 (b)           If the Master Servicer determines that there is a P&I Advance Amount for a Distribution Date, the Master Servicer shall on the related Master Servicer Remittance Date either (A) deposit in the Collection Account an amount equal to the P&I Advance Amount or (B) utilize funds in the Collection Account being held for future distributions or withdrawals to make such Advance.  Any funds being held in the Collection Account for future distribution or withdrawal and so used shall be replaced by the Master Servicer from its own funds by deposit in the Collection Account on or before any future Master Servicer Remittance Date to the extent that funds in the Collection Account on such Master Servicer Remittance Date shall be less than payments to the Certificate Administrator or other Persons required to be made on such date.



 (c)           In no event shall the Master Servicer (or the Trustee, as applicable) be obligated to make a P&I Advance with respect to a B Note or a Serviced Companion Loan.







 (d)           In no event shall the Master Servicer (or the Trustee, as applicable) be obligated to make a P&I Advance with respect to any Mortgage Loan if the sum of all outstanding P&I Advances in respect of such Mortgage Loan (together with Advance Interest) is equal to or greater than the Stated Principal Balance plus all overdue amounts on such Mortgage Loan.



 Section 4.1A     P&I Advances with Respect to Non-Serviced Mortgage Loans and Serviced Pari Passu Mortgage Loans.  With respect to the Non-Serviced Mortgage Loans and Serviced Pari Passu Mortgage Loans (the "P&I Pari Passu Loans"), the Master Servicer shall make its determination that a P&I Advance previously made on any P&I Pari Passu Loan is a Nonrecoverable Advance or that any proposed P&I Advance, if made, would constitute a Nonrecoverable Advance with respect to such P&I Pari Passu Loan in accordance with Section 4.1 independently of any determination made by any Other Master Servicer under the related Other Companion Loan Pooling and Servicing Agreement in respect of any P&I Pari Passu Loan following deposit of the Non-Serviced Companion Loans or Serviced Companion Loans into a commercial mortgage securitization trust, and the Other Master Servicer shall make its own determination that it has made a P&I Advance that is a Nonrecoverable Advance (both as defined in the related Other Companion Loan Pooling and Servicing Agreement) or that any proposed P&I Advance, if made, would constitute a Nonrecoverable Advance (both as defined in the related Other Companion Loan Pooling and Servicing Agreement) with respect to the Non-Serviced Companion Loans or Serviced Companion Loans, as applicable, in accordance with the related Other Companion Loan Pooling and Servicing Agreement.  No determination by either the Master Servicer or the Other Master Servicer that any such P&I Advance is nonrecoverable shall be binding on the Other Master Servicer or the Master Servicer, as applicable, the Certificateholders or the holders of any securities relating to the Non-Serviced Companion Loans or Serviced Companion Loans, as applicable.



 The Master Servicer shall not be required to make a P&I Advance with respect to any P&I Pari Passu Loan after its receipt of notice from the related Other Master Servicer that it has determined that it has made a P&I Advance that is a Nonrecoverable Advance on the Non-Serviced Companion Loans or Serviced Companion Loans, as applicable, or that any proposed P&I Advance, if made, would constitute a Nonrecoverable Advance pursuant to the relevant Other Companion Loan Pooling and Servicing Agreement.  If the Master Servicer determines that a P&I Advance would be (if made), or any outstanding P&I Advance previously made is, a Nonrecoverable Advance, the Master Servicer shall provide the Other Master Servicer written notice of such determination.  If the Master Servicer receives written notice by the Other Master Servicer that it has determined, with respect to any Mortgage Loan, that any proposed future P&I Advance would be, or any outstanding P&I Advance is, a Nonrecoverable Advance, the Master Servicer shall use reasonable efforts to consult on a non-binding basis with the Other Master Servicer regarding the circumstances with respect to such Mortgage Loan, but the Master Servicer shall be allowed to ultimately make its own determination.  Any determination that a P&I Advance would be a Nonrecoverable Advance with respect to any Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan by the Master Servicer or any Other Master Servicer may, in all cases, be relied on by the Trustee and the Master Servicer.  If the Master Servicer or the Trustee does not receive notice of an Appraisal Reduction with respect to any Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan, the Master Servicer or the Trustee, as applicable, shall not be obligated to proportionately reduce the amount of any







 P&I Advance required to be made by it, except to the extent an Appraisal Reduction is applied as described in the last sentence of the definition of "Appraisal Reduction."



 Following a securitization of a Serviced Companion Loan, the Master Servicer shall be required to deliver to the related Other Master Servicer the following information:  (i) any loan related information (in the form received), including without limitation CREFCÂ® Reports relating to the related Serviced Pari Passu Mortgage Loan, applicable to a determination that an Advance is or would be a Nonrecoverable Advance, within one (1) Business Day of the Master Servicer's receipt thereof, (ii) notice of any Servicing Advance it, the Special Servicer or the Trustee makes with respect to the related Serviced Pari Passu Mortgage Loan within one (1) Business Day of the making of such Advance and (iii) notice of any determination that any Servicing Advance is a Nonrecoverable Advance within one (1) Business Day thereof.



 Section 4.2     Servicing Advances.  The Master Servicer and, if the Master Servicer does not, the Trustee to the extent the Trustee receives written notice from the Certificate Administrator that such Advance has not been made by the Master Servicer, shall make Servicing Advances to the extent provided in this Agreement, except to the extent that the Master Servicer or the Trustee as applicable, determines in accordance with Section 4.4 below, that any such Advance would be a Nonrecoverable Advance and, subject to the last sentence of this paragraph, except to the extent the Special Servicer determines in accordance with the Servicing Standard and Section 4.4 that such Advance, if made, would be a Nonrecoverable Advance, in which event the Special Servicer shall promptly direct the Master Servicer not to make such Advance; provided that the Special Servicer has no obligation to make such determination.  Such determination by the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer shall be conclusive and binding on the Trustee and the Certificateholders and, in the case of any B Note, the holder of the related B Note and, in the case of any Serviced Pari Passu Mortgage Loan, the holder of the related Serviced Companion Loan.  The Special Servicer shall not be required to make Servicing Advances under this Agreement but may make such Servicing Advances (on an emergency basis) at its option in which event the Master Servicer shall reimburse the Special Servicer for such Servicing Advance (together with Advance Interest) promptly (but no later than five (5) Business Days) following receipt of a statement therefor.  Promptly after discovering that the Master Servicer has failed to make a Servicing Advance that the Master Servicer is required to make hereunder, the Certificate Administrator shall promptly notify the Trustee (if the Certificate Administrator is not also the Trustee) in writing of the failure by the Master Servicer to make such Servicing Advance.  The Master Servicer may make Servicing Advances in its own discretion if it determines that making such Servicing Advance is in the best interest of the Certificateholders, as a collective whole (and, in the case of any A/B Whole Loan, in the best interest of the holder of the related B Note and the Trust as a collective whole and, in the case of any Loan Pair, in the best interest of the holder of the related Serviced Companion Loan and the Trust as a collective whole), even if the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer has determined, in accordance with Section 4.4 below, that any such Advance would be a Nonrecoverable Advance.



 The applicable Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan Master Servicer is obligated to make "Servicing Advances" as defined in, and pursuant to, the related Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan Pooling and Servicing Agreement with respect to any Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan, and







 the Master Servicer shall have no obligation or authority to make Servicing Advances with respect to such Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan.



 Section 4.3     Advances by the Trustee.



 (a)           To the extent that the Master Servicer fails to make a P&I Advance with respect to a Mortgage Loan by the Master Servicer Remittance Date (other than a P&I Advance that the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer determines is a Nonrecoverable Advance), the Trustee shall make such P&I Advance with respect to such Mortgage Loan to the extent the Trustee receives written notice from the Certificate Administrator not later than 10:00 axxPDmxxPD (New York City time) on the Distribution Date that such Advance has not been made by the Master Servicer on the Master Servicer Remittance Date unless the Trustee determines (in its good faith business judgment) that such P&I Advance, if made, would be a Nonrecoverable Advance.  The Certificate Administrator shall notify (i) the Trustee (if the Certificate Administrator is not also the Trustee) in writing as soon as practicable, but not later than 10:00 axxPDmxxPD (New York City time) on the Distribution Date if the Master Servicer has failed to make a P&I Advance and (ii) the Master Servicer in writing as soon as practicable, but not later than 5:00 pxxPDmxxPD (New York City time) on the Master Servicer Remittance Date, if it has not received a P&I Advance with respect to any Mortgage Loan set forth in the Master Servicer Remittance Report provided to the Certificate Administrator on the related Advance Report Date; provided, the failure of the Certificate Administrator to provide any such notice within such timeframe shall not diminish in any respect the obligation of the Master Servicer or the Trustee, as applicable, to make such P&I Advance.



 (b)           To the extent that the Master Servicer fails to make a Servicing Advance by the date such Servicing Advance is required to be made (other than a Servicing Advance that the Master Servicer determines is a Nonrecoverable Advance), and a Responsible Officer of the Trustee receives actual notice thereof, the Trustee shall make such Servicing Advance promptly, but in any event, not later than five (5) Business Days after notice thereof in accordance with Section 4.2, unless the Trustee determines (in its good faith business judgment) that such Servicing Advance, if made, would be a Nonrecoverable Advance.



 (c)           In no event shall the Trustee be obligated to make a P&I Advance with respect to a B Note or a Serviced Companion Loan or any Servicing Advance with respect to a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan.



 Section 4.4     Evidence of Nonrecoverability.



 (a)           If the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer determines at any time, in its sole discretion, exercised in good faith, that any Advance previously made (or Unliquidated Advance in respect thereof) constitutes, or any proposed Advance, if made, would constitute, a Nonrecoverable Advance, such determination shall be evidenced by an Officer's Certificate delivered to the other such party, the Trustee, the Depositor, the Certificate Administrator, the 17g-5 Information Provider, the Trust Advisor (other than during any Subordinate Control Period), the Controlling Class Representative (during any Subordinate Control Period and any Collective Consultation Period) and the holder of the related B Note or Serviced Companion Loan (if the Advance relates to an A/B Whole Loan or a Loan Pair, as applicable) by the







 Business Day prior to the Distribution Date.  Such Officer's Certificate shall set forth the reasons for such determination of nonrecoverability, together with, to the extent such information, report or document is in the Master Servicer's or Special Servicer's possession, and, if such information, reports or documents are used by the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as applicable, to determine that any P&I Advance or Servicing Advance, as applicable, would be a Nonrecoverable Advance, any related financial information such as related income and expense statements, rent rolls, occupancy status, property inspections and any Appraisals performed within the last twelve (12) months on the Mortgaged Property, any engineers' reports, environmental surveys, internal final valuations or other information relevant thereto which support such determination.  If the Trustee determines at any time that any Advance previously made by the Trustee constitutes, or any proposed Advance, if made by the Trustee, would constitute, a Nonrecoverable Advance, such determination shall be evidenced by an Officer's Certificate of a Responsible Officer of the Trustee delivered to the Depositor, the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Certificate Administrator, the 17g-5 Information Provider, the holder of any related B Note or Serviced Companion Loan (if the Advance relates to an A/B Whole Loan or a Loan Pair, as applicable), the Trust Advisor (other than during any Subordinate Control Period) and the Controlling Class Representative (during any Subordinate Control Period and any Collective Consultation Period), stating the reasons for such determination.  In making any nonrecoverability determination as set forth above, the relevant party shall be entitled (i) to consider (among other things) the obligations of the Mortgagor under the terms of the Mortgage Loan as it may have been modified, (ii) to consider (among other things) the related Mortgaged Properties in their "as is" or then-current conditions and occupancies as they actually are or may be modified by such party's assumptions (consistent with the Servicing Standard in the case of the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer) regarding the possibility and effects of future adverse change with respect to such Mortgaged Properties and/or (iii) to estimate and consider, consistent with the Servicing Standard in the case of the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer (among other things), future expenses and/or the timing of recovery to such party.  In addition, any Person, in considering whether any proposed P&I Advance or Servicing Advance would be a Nonrecoverable Advance, shall be entitled to give due regard to the existence of any Nonrecoverable Advance (including any related Advance Interest) or Workout-Delayed Reimbursement Amounts with respect to other Mortgage Loans, A/B Whole Loans or Loan Pairs which, at the time of such consideration, the reimbursement of which is being deferred or delayed by the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer or the Trustee because there is insufficient principal available for such reimbursement, in light of the fact that proceeds on the related Mortgage Loan, A/B Whole Loan or Loan Pair are a source of recovery not only for the Advance under consideration, but also as a potential source of recovery of such Nonrecoverable Advance or Workout-Delayed Reimbursement Amounts which are or may be being deferred or delayed.  Furthermore, the relevant party may, consistent with the Servicing Standard in the case of the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, update or change its nonrecoverability determinations at any time in accordance with the terms hereof and may, consistent with the Servicing Standard in the case of the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, obtain from the Special Servicer any analysis, appraisals or other information in the possession of the Special Servicer for such purposes.



 (b)           The Trustee shall not be required to make an Advance that the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer (or with respect to a Mortgage Loan included in a Loan Pair or any Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan, the related Other Master Servicer) has previously determined







 to be a Nonrecoverable Advance.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, none of the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer or the Trustee shall be obligated to, nor shall it, make any Advance or make any payment that is designated in this Agreement to be an Advance, if it determines, with regard to the Trustee, in its good faith business judgment or, with respect to the Master Servicer or Special Servicer, in accordance with the Servicing Standard that such Advance or such payment (including interest accrued thereon at the Advance Rate) would be a Nonrecoverable Advance.  Absent bad faith, the Master Servicer's and Special Servicer's determinations in accordance with the above provisions shall be conclusive and binding on the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator and the Certificateholders and may be relied on by the Trustee and each other.  The Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as applicable, shall consider Unliquidated Advances in respect of prior P&I Advances and Servicing Advances as outstanding Advances for purposes of nonrecoverability determinations as if such Unliquidated Advance were a P&I Advance or Servicing Advance, as applicable.



 (c)        Any Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan Master Servicer, Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan Trustee or Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan Fiscal Agent, as applicable, shall be entitled to reimbursement for Pari Passu Loan Nonrecoverable Advances pursuant to and to the extent set forth in the related Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan Intercreditor Agreement (with, in each case, any accrued and unpaid interest thereon provided for under the related Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan Pooling and Servicing Agreement) in the manner set forth in Section 5.2.



 Section 4.5     Interest on Advances; Calculation of Outstanding Advances with Respect to a Mortgage Loan.  Any unreimbursed Advance funded from the Master Servicer's, the Special Servicer's or the Trustee's own funds shall accrue interest, compounded annually, at a per annum rate equal to the Advance Rate, from and including the date such Advance was made to but not including the date on which such Advance has been reimbursed; provided that neither the Master Servicer nor any other party shall be entitled to interest accrued on the amount of any P&I Advance with respect to any Mortgage Loan for the period commencing on the date of such P&I Advance and ending on the day on which the grace period applicable to the related Mortgagor's obligation to make the related Scheduled Payment expires pursuant to the related Mortgage Loan documents.  All Late Collections on any Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan in respect of interest shall, promptly following receipt thereof, be applied by the Master Servicer to reimburse the interest component of any P&I Advance outstanding with respect to such Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan.  Any party that makes a P&I Advance with respect to any Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan shall provide to the applicable Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan Master Servicer monthly, at least two (2) Business Days prior to the next succeeding Due Date for such Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan, written notice of whether (and, if any, how much) Advance Interest will be payable on the interest component of that P&I Advance through the next succeeding related Master Servicer Remittance Date.  For purposes of determining whether a P&I Advance is outstanding, amounts collected with respect to a particular Mortgage Loan (including an REO Mortgage Loan) and treated as collections of principal or interest shall be applied first to reimburse the earliest P&I Advance, and then each succeeding P&I Advance to the extent not inconsistent with Section 4.6.  The Master Servicer shall use efforts consistent with the Servicing Standard to collect (but shall have no further obligation to collect), with respect to the Mortgage Loans (other than a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan) and the Serviced Companion Loans that are not Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans, Penalty Charges from the Mortgagor in an amount sufficient to pay Advance Interest.  The







 Master Servicer shall be entitled to retain Excess Penalty Charges paid by any Mortgagor during a Collection Period with respect to any Mortgage Loan (other than the portion of such Excess Penalty Charges that relate to the period commencing after the Servicing Transfer Event in respect of a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan, as to which the Special Servicer shall retain Excess Penalty Charges with respect to such Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan) as additional servicing compensation.  Penalty Charges shall be applied in accordance with Section 5.2(b).



 Section 4.6     Reimbursement of Advances and Advance Interest.



 (a)           Advances made with respect to each Mortgage Loan, Serviced Companion Loan, B Note, Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan or REO Property (including Advances later determined to be Nonrecoverable Advances) and Advance Interest thereon shall be reimbursed to the extent of the amounts identified to be applied therefor in Section 5.2.  The aggregate of the amounts available to repay Advances and Advance Interest thereon pursuant to Section 5.2 collected in any Collection Period with respect to Mortgage Loans, any Serviced Companion Loan or any B Note or Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans or REO Property shall be an "Available Advance Reimbursement Amount."



 (b)           To the extent that Advances have been made on the Mortgage Loans, any Loan Pair, any A/B Whole Loan or any REO Loans, the Available Advance Reimbursement Amount with respect to any Master Servicer Remittance Date shall be applied to reimburse (i) the Trustee for any Advances outstanding to the Trustee with respect to any of such Mortgage Loans, Loan Pairs, A/B Whole Loans and/or REO Loans, plus any Advance Interest owed to the Trustee with respect to such Advances, and then (ii) the Master Servicer and the Special Servicer for any Advances outstanding thereto with respect to any of such Mortgage Loans, Loan Pairs, A/B Whole Loans and/or REO Loans, plus any Advance Interest owed to the Master Servicer and the Special Servicer with respect to such Advances.  To the extent that any Advance Interest payable to the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer or the Trustee with respect to an Advance on a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan or REO Loan cannot be recovered from the related Mortgagor, the amount of such Advance Interest shall be payable to the Trustee, the Special Servicer or the Master Servicer, as the case may be, from amounts on deposit in the Collection Account (or sub-account thereof) or the Distribution Account, to the extent of amounts identified to be applied therefor, pursuant to Section 5.2(a), Section 5.2(b) or Section 5.3(b)(ii).  The Master Servicer's, the Special Servicer's and the Trustee's right of reimbursement under this Agreement for Advances, together with Advance Interest thereon, shall be prior to the rights of the Certificateholders (and, in the case of a Serviced Companion Loan, the holder thereof and, in the case of a B Note, the holder thereof) to receive any amounts recovered with respect to such Mortgage Loans, Serviced Companion Loans, B Notes or REO Loans.



 (c)           Advance Interest will be paid to the Trustee, the Master Servicer and/or the Special Servicer (in accordance with the priorities specified in the preceding paragraph) first, in accordance with Section 5.2(b), from Penalty Charges and Allocable Modification Fees collected from the Mortgage Loans and, subject to the related Intercreditor Agreements, the Serviced Companion Loans and B Note (including REO Loans) during any particular Collection Period during which the related Advance is reimbursed, and then from Excess Liquidation Proceeds then available, prior to payment from any other amounts.  Advance Interest payable to the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer or the Trustee in respect of Servicing Advances on any







 Loan Pair shall be allocated to the Serviced Pari Passu Mortgage Loan and the Serviced Companion Loan on a pro rata basis based upon the respective Unpaid Principal Balances thereof.



 (d)           Amounts applied to reimburse Advances shall first be applied to reduce Advance Interest thereon that was not paid from amounts specified in the preceding paragraph (c) and then to reduce the outstanding amount of such Advances.



 (e)           To the extent that the Special Servicer incurs out-of-pocket expenses, in accordance with the Servicing Standard, in connection with servicing Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans, the Master Servicer shall reimburse the Special Servicer for such expenditures with interest at the Advance Rate promptly (but no later than five (5) days) after receiving an invoice and a report from the Special Servicer, subject to Section 4.4.  The Special Servicer shall not invoice the Master Servicer more than once per calendar month and shall provide an Officer's Certificate setting forth its expenses and appropriate documentation evidencing such reimbursements.  With respect to each Collection Period, the Special Servicer shall deliver such invoice and report to the Master Servicer by the following Determination Date.  All such amounts reimbursed by the Master Servicer shall be a Servicing Advance, subject to Section 4.4.  If the Master Servicer fails to reimburse the Special Servicer hereunder or the Master Servicer determines that such Servicing Advance was or, if made, would be a Nonrecoverable Advance and the Master Servicer does not make such payment, the Special Servicer shall notify the Master Servicer and the Certificate Administrator in writing of such nonpayment and the amount payable to the Special Servicer and shall be entitled to receive reimbursement from the Trust in the same manner as the Master Servicer would have been reimbursed for the Advance with interest at the Advance Rate.  The Master Servicer, the Certificate Administrator and the Trustee shall have no obligation to verify the amount payable to the Special Servicer pursuant to this Section 4.6(e) and circumstances surrounding the notice delivered by the Special Servicer pursuant to this Section 4.6(e).

 (A)           to the extent consistent with the related Intercreditor Agreement, the Master Servicer shall be entitled to make transfers from time to time, from the related Serviced Companion Loan Custodial Account to the portion of the Collection Account that does not constitute any Serviced Companion Loan Custodial Account, of amounts necessary for the payments or reimbursement of amounts described in any one or more of clauses (i), (ii), (iv), (vi), (vii) and (viii) above, but only insofar as the payment or reimbursement described therein arises from or is related to the corresponding Loan Pair and is allocable to, and may (in accordance with the related Intercreditor Agreement) be paid out of amounts otherwise payable to the holder of, the related Serviced Companion Loan, and the Master Servicer shall also be entitled to make transfers from time to time, from the related Serviced Companion Loan Custodial Account to the portion of the Collection Account that does not constitute any Serviced Companion Loan Custodial Account, of amounts transferred to the related Serviced Companion Loan Custodial Account in error, and amounts necessary for the clearing and termination of the Collection Account in connection with the termination of the Trust;



 (B)           the Master Servicer shall be entitled to make transfers from time to time, from the related Serviced Companion Loan Custodial Account to the portion of the Collection Account that does not constitute any Serviced Companion Loan Custodial Account, of amounts not otherwise described in clause (A) above to which the holder of the related Serviced Pari Passu Mortgage Loan is entitled under the related Intercreditor Agreement (including in respect of interest, principal and Prepayment Premiums); and



 (C)           the Master Servicer shall, on either (x) the date set forth in the related Intercreditor Agreement for remittances (or, if none, on the first (1st) Business Day after receipt) or (y) such other date as may be agreed to between the Master Servicer and the holder of the related Serviced Companion Loan (in their respective sole discretion), remit to the holder of the related Serviced Companion Loan all amounts on deposit in such related Serviced Companion Loan Custodial Account (net of amounts permitted or required to be transferred therefrom as set forth in clauses (A) and/or (B) above), to the extent that the holder of such Serviced Companion Loan is entitled thereto under the related Intercreditor Agreement.



 The Master Servicer shall pay to each of the Special Servicer (or, in the case of an emergency, to third party contractors at the written direction of the Special Servicer), the Trust Advisor, the Custodian, the Trustee and the Certificate Administrator, as applicable, from the







 applicable Collection Account, amounts permitted to be paid thereto from such account promptly upon receipt on or prior to the related Determination Date of a written statement of an officer of the Special Servicer, an officer of the Trust Advisor or a Responsible Officer of the Trustee, the Custodian or the Certificate Administrator, as the case may be, describing the item and amount to which the Special Servicer (or, in the case of an emergency, such third party contractor), the Trust Advisor, the Trustee, the Custodian or the Certificate Administrator, as the case may be, is entitled (unless such payment to the Special Servicer, the Trust Advisor, the Trustee, the Custodian or the Certificate Administrator, as the case may be, is clearly required pursuant to this Agreement, in which case a written statement is not required).  The Master Servicer may rely conclusively on any such written statement and shall have no duty to recalculate or investigate (absent manifest error) the amounts stated therein.  The parties seeking payment pursuant to this Section shall each keep and maintain a separate accounting for the purpose of justifying any request for withdrawal from each Collection Account, on a loan by loan basis.



 No decision by the Master Servicer or the Trustee under either this Section 5.2(a)(I) or subsection (iv) of Section 5.2(a)(II), to defer the reimbursement of Advances and/or Advance Interest shall be construed as an agreement by the Master Servicer to subordinate (in respect of realizing losses), to any Class of Certificates, such party's right to such reimbursement during such period of deferral.



 Expenses incurred with respect to any A/B Whole Loan or Loan Pair shall be allocated in accordance with the related Intercreditor Agreement (or with respect to a Joint Mortgage Loan treated as a Loan Pair in accordance with Section 8.30 hereof, the applicable Mortgage Loan documents).  The Master Servicer shall keep and maintain a separate accounting for each Mortgage Loan, Serviced Companion Loan and B Note for the purpose of justifying any withdrawal or transfer from the Collection Account, each Serviced Companion Loan Custodial Account and any A/B Whole Loan Custodial Account, as applicable.  If funds collected in respect of the A Notes are insufficient to pay the Master Servicing Fee, then the Master Servicer shall be entitled to withdraw the amount of such shortfall from the collections on, and other proceeds of, the B Note that are held in the related A/B Whole Loan Custodial Account.  The Master Servicer shall not be permitted to withdraw any funds from the portion of the Collection Account that does not constitute the A/B Whole Loan Custodial Account unless there are no remaining funds in the related A/B Whole Loan Custodial Account available and required to be paid in accordance with the related Intercreditor Agreement.



 Subsection (II).  The provisions of this subsection II of this Section 5.2(a) shall apply notwithstanding any contrary provision of subsection (I) of this Section 5.2(a):



 (i)             Identification of Workout-Delayed Reimbursement Amounts.  If any Advance made with respect to any Mortgage Loan on or before the date on which such Mortgage Loan becomes (or, but for the requirement that the Mortgagor shall have made three (3) consecutive scheduled payments under its modified terms, would then constitute) a Rehabilitated Mortgage Loan, together with Advance Interest accrued thereon, is not, pursuant to the operation of the provisions of Section 5.2(a)(I), reimbursed to the Person who made such Advance on or before the date, if any, on which such Mortgage Loan becomes a Rehabilitated Mortgage Loan, such Advance, together with such Advance Interest, shall constitute a "Workout-Delayed Reimbursement







 Amount" to the extent that such amount has not been determined to constitute a Nonrecoverable Advance.  All references herein to "Workout-Delayed Reimbursement Amount" shall be construed always to mean the related Advance and any Advance Interest thereon, together with any further Advance Interest that accrues on the unreimbursed portion of such Advance from time to time in accordance with the other provisions of this Agreement.  That any amount constitutes all or a portion of any Workout-Delayed Reimbursement Amount shall not in any manner limit the right of any Person hereunder to determine that such amount instead constitutes a Nonrecoverable Advance.



 (ii)            General Relationship of Provisions.  Subsection (iii) below (subject to the terms and conditions thereof) sets forth the terms of and conditions to the right of a Person to be reimbursed for any Workout-Delayed Reimbursement Amount to the extent that such Person is not otherwise entitled to reimbursement and payment of such Workout-Delayed Reimbursement Amount pursuant to the operation of Section 5.2(a)(I) above.  Subsection (iv) below (subject to the terms and conditions thereof) authorizes the Master Servicer to abstain from reimbursing itself (or, if applicable, the Trustee to abstain from obtaining reimbursement) for Nonrecoverable Advances under certain circumstances at its sole option.  Upon any determination that all or any portion of a Workout-Delayed Reimbursement Amount constitutes a Nonrecoverable Advance, then the reimbursement or payment of such amount (and any further Advance Interest that may accrue thereon) shall cease to be subject to the operation of subsection (iii) below, such amount (and further Advance Interest) shall be as fully payable and reimbursable to the relevant Person as would any other Nonrecoverable Advance (and Advance Interest thereon) and, as a Nonrecoverable Advance, such amount may become the subject of the Master Servicer's (or, if applicable, the Trustee's) exercise of its sole option authorized by subsection (iv) below.



 (iii)           Reimbursements of Workout-Delayed Reimbursement Amounts.  The Master Servicer, the Special Servicer and the Trustee, as applicable, shall be entitled to reimbursement and payment for all Workout-Delayed Reimbursement Amounts in each Collection Period; provided that the aggregate amount (for all such Persons collectively) of such reimbursements and payments in such Collection Period shall not exceed (and the reimbursement and payment shall be made from) the aggregate amount in the Collection Account allocable to principal received with respect to the Mortgage Loans for such Collection Period contemplated by clause (I)(A) of the definition of Principal Distribution Amount (but not including any such amounts that constitute Advances) and net of any Nonrecoverable Advances then outstanding and reimbursable from such principal in accordance with Section 5.2(a)(II)(iv) below.  As and to the extent provided in clause (II)(A) of the definition thereof, the Principal Distribution Amount for the Distribution Date related to such Collection Period shall be reduced to the extent that such payment or reimbursement of a Workout-Delayed Reimbursement Amount is made from the aggregate amount in the Collection Account allocable to principal pursuant to the preceding sentence.



 (iv)           Reimbursement of Nonrecoverable Advances; Sole Option to Abstain from Reimbursements of Certain Nonrecoverable Advances.  To the extent that







 Section 5.2(a)(I) otherwise entitles each of the Master Servicer and the Trustee to reimbursement for any Nonrecoverable Advance (or payment of Advance Interest thereon from a source other than Penalty Charges and Allocable Modification Fees on the related Mortgage Loan) during any Collection Period, then, notwithstanding any contrary provision of subsection (I) above, (a) to the extent that one or more such reimbursements and payments of Nonrecoverable Advances (and such Advance Interest thereon) are made, such reimbursements and payments shall be made, first, from the aggregate amount in the Collection Account allocable to principal received with respect to the Mortgage Loans for such Collection Period contemplated by clause (I)(A) of the definition of Principal Distribution Amount (but not including any such amounts that constitute Advances, and prior to any deduction for Workout-Delayed Reimbursement Amounts (and Advance Interest thereon) that were reimbursed or paid during the related Collection Period from amounts allocable to principal received with respect to the Mortgage Loans, as described by clause (II)(A) of the definition of Principal Distribution Amount and pursuant to subsection (iii) of Section 5.2(a)(II)), and then from other collections (including interest) on the Mortgage Loans for such Collection Period, and (b) if and to the extent that the amount of such a Nonrecoverable Advance (and Advance Interest thereon), together with all Nonrecoverable Advances (and Advance Interest thereon) theretofore reimbursed during such Collection Period, would exceed such principal on the Mortgage Loans for such Collection Period (and Advance Interest thereon), the Master Servicer (and the Trustee, if it made the relevant Advance) is hereby authorized (but shall not be construed to have any obligation whatsoever), if it elects at its sole option, to abstain from reimbursing itself (notwithstanding that it is entitled to such reimbursement) during that Collection Period for all or a portion of such Nonrecoverable Advance (and Advance Interest thereon), provided that the aggregate amount that is deferred with respect to all Nonrecoverable Advances (and Advance Interest thereon) with respect to all Mortgage Loans for any particular Collection Period is less than or equal to such excess described above in this clause (b).  If the Master Servicer (or the Trustee) makes such an election at its sole option to defer reimbursement with respect to all or a portion of a Nonrecoverable Advance (and Advance Interest thereon), then such Nonrecoverable Advance (and Advance Interest thereon) or portion thereof shall continue to be fully reimbursable in any subsequent Collection Period to the same extent as set forth above.  In connection with a potential election by the Master Servicer or the Trustee to abstain from the reimbursement of a particular Nonrecoverable Advance or portion thereof during the Collection Period for any Distribution Date, the Master Servicer (or the Trustee) shall further be authorized to wait for principal collections to be received before making its determination of whether to abstain from the reimbursement of a particular Nonrecoverable Advance or portion thereof until the end of the Collection Period.



 None of the Master Servicer or the Trustee shall have any liability whatsoever for making an election, or refraining from making an election, that is authorized under this subsection (II)(iv).  The foregoing shall not, however, be construed to limit any liability that may otherwise be imposed on such Person for any failure by such Person to comply with the conditions to making such an election under this subsection (II)(iv) or to comply with the terms of this subsection (II)(iv) and the other provisions of this Agreement that apply once such an election, if any, has been made.







 Any election by the Master Servicer (or the Trustee) to abstain from reimbursing itself for any Nonrecoverable Advance (and Advance Interest thereon) or portion thereof with respect to any Collection Period shall not be construed to impose on the Master Servicer (or the Trustee) any obligation to make such an election (or any entitlement in favor of any Certificateholder or any other Person to such an election) with respect to any subsequent Collection Period or to constitute a waiver or limitation on the right of the Master Servicer (or the Trustee) to otherwise be reimbursed for such Nonrecoverable Advance (and Advance Interest thereon).  Any election by the Master Servicer or the Trustee to abstain from reimbursing itself for any Nonrecoverable Advance or portion thereof with respect to any one or more Collection Periods shall not limit the accrual of Advance Interest on the unreimbursed portion of such Nonrecoverable Advance for the period prior to the actual reimbursement of such Nonrecoverable Advance.  None of the Master Servicer, the Trustee or the other parties to this Agreement shall have any liability to one another or to any of the Certificateholders or any holder of a B Note or Serviced Companion Loan for any such election that such party makes as contemplated by this subsection or for any losses, damages or other adverse economic or other effects that may arise from such an election.  The foregoing statements in this paragraph shall not limit the generality of the statements made in the immediately preceding paragraph.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Master Servicer nor the Trustee shall have the right to abstain from reimbursing itself for any Nonrecoverable Advance to the extent of the amount described in clause (I)(A) of the definition of Principal Distribution Amount.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, neither the Master Servicer nor the Trustee may abstain from reimbursing itself for any particular Nonrecoverable Advance for a period in excess of twelve (12) months, and during any Subordinate Control Period and any Collective Consultation Period, neither the Master Servicer nor the Trustee may abstain from reimbursing itself for any particular Nonrecoverable Advance for a period in excess of six (6) months without the consent of the Controlling Class Representative.



 (v)           Reimbursement Rights of the Master Servicer, Special Servicer and Trustee Are Senior.  Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to create in any Certificateholder a right to prior payment of distributions over the Master Servicer's, the Special Servicer's or the Trustee's right to reimbursement for Advances plus Advance Interest (whether those that constitute Workout-Delayed Reimbursement Amounts, those that have been the subject of the Master Servicer's election authorized in subsection (iv) or otherwise).



 (b)           On each Master Servicer Remittance Date, the Master Servicer shall withdraw from the Collection Account and apply as follows all Penalty Charges (subject to any allocation provision with respect to Penalty Charges in any related Intercreditor Agreement) and Allocable Modification Fees (in that order) received with respect to a Mortgage Loan or, unless otherwise required to be paid to the holder thereof pursuant to the related Intercreditor Agreement, a Serviced Companion Loan or B Note during the most recently ended Collection Period:



 (i)            first, to pay or reimburse the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer and/or the Trustee, as applicable, for all outstanding Nonrecoverable Advances (together with all







 unpaid Advance Interest on such Nonrecoverable Advances), all unpaid Advance Interest on any other Advances and any other outstanding Additional Trust Expenses, in each case, with respect to such Mortgage Loan or, if applicable, the related Loan Pair or A/B Whole Loan;



 (ii)            second, as a reimbursement to the Trust of all Advances (and related Advance Interest) with respect to such Mortgage Loan or, if applicable, the related Loan Pair or A/B Whole Loan previously determined to be Nonrecoverable Advances and previously reimbursed to the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer and/or Trustee, as applicable, from amounts (other than related Penalty Charges and Allocable Modification Fees) on deposit in the Collection Account  (and such amounts will be retained or deposited in the Collection Account as recoveries of such Nonrecoverable Advances and related Advance Interest);



 (iii)           third, as a reimbursement to the Trust of all other Additional Trust Expenses with respect to such Mortgage Loan or, if applicable, the related Loan Pair or A/B Whole Loan previously paid from the Collection Account (and such amounts will be retained or deposited in the Collection Account as recoveries of such Additional Trust Expenses); and



 (iv)           fourth, to pay any remaining Penalty Charges and Allocable Modification Fees to the Master Servicer and/or the Special Servicer, as applicable, as compensation as set forth in either Section 8.10 or Section 9.11, as applicable.



 (c)           With respect to any Master Servicer Remittance Date, Scheduled Payments due in a Collection Period succeeding the Collection Period relating to such Master Servicer Remittance Date, Principal Prepayments received after the related Collection Period, or other amounts not distributable on the related Distribution Date, shall be held in the Collection Account (or a sub-account thereof) and shall be remitted to the Distribution Account on the applicable successive Master Servicer Remittance Date or Dates.  The Master Servicer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to remit to the Distribution Account on any Master Servicer Remittance Date for a Collection Period any Balloon Payments received during the period that that begins two (2) Business Days immediately preceding the related Master Servicer Remittance Date and ends on such Master Servicer Remittance Date.  In connection with the deposit of any Balloon Payments to the Distribution Account in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence, the Master Servicer shall promptly notify the Certificate Administrator and the Certificate Administrator shall, if it has already reported anticipated distributions to the Depository, use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Depository to make the revised distribution on a timely basis on such Distribution Date.  Neither the Master Servicer nor the Certificate Administrator shall be liable or held responsible for any resulting delay or failure in the making of such distribution to Certificateholders.  For purposes of the definition of "Available Distribution Amount" and "Principal Distribution Amount," any Balloon Payments that are received prior to the Master Servicer Remittance Date in any Collection Period but are includable in the distributions on the Distribution Date in such Collection Period as provided above, shall each be deemed to have been collected in the prior Collection Period.







 Section 5.3     Distribution Account and Reserve Accounts.



 (a)           The Certificate Administrator, on behalf of the Trustee shall establish (with respect to clause (i) and clause (ii), on or prior to the Closing Date, and with respect to clause (iii) and clause (iv), on or prior to the date the Certificate Administrator determines is necessary) and maintain in its name, on behalf of the Trustee, (i) an account (the "Distribution Account"), to be held for the benefit of the Holders until disbursed pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, titled:  "Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Certificate Administrator on behalf of UxxPDSxxPD Bank National Association, as Trustee, for the benefit of the Holders of Morgan Stanley Bank of America Merrill Lynch Trust 2013-C12, Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2013-C12, Distribution Account", (ii) an account (the "Interest Reserve Account") to be held for the benefit of the Holders until disbursed pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, titled:  "Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Certificate Administrator on behalf of UxxPDSxxPD Bank National Association, as Trustee, for the benefit of the Holders of Morgan Stanley Bank of America Merrill Lynch Trust 2013-C12, Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2013-C12, Interest Reserve Account", (iii) an account (the "Excess Liquidation Proceeds Reserve Account") to be held for the benefit of the Holders until disbursed pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, titled:  "Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Certificate Administrator on behalf of UxxPDSxxPD Bank National Association, as Trustee, for the benefit of the Holders of Morgan Stanley Bank of America Merrill Lynch Trust 2013-C12, Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2013-C12, Excess Liquidation Proceeds Reserve Account", and (iv) an account (the "TA Unused Fees Reserve Account") to be held for the benefit of the Holders until disbursed pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, titled:  "Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Certificate Administrator on behalf of UxxPDSxxPD Bank National Association, as Trustee, for the benefit of the Holders of Morgan Stanley Bank of America Merrill Lynch Trust 2013-C12, Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2013-C12, TA Unused Fees Reserve Account".  The Distribution Account and the Reserve Accounts shall be Eligible Accounts.  Funds in the Reserve Accounts shall not be invested.  The Distribution Account and the Reserve Accounts shall be held separate and apart from and shall not be commingled with any other monies of or held by the Certificate Administrator, it being understood, however, that each Reserve Account shall be a subaccount of the Distribution Account.



 Funds in the Distribution Account may be invested and, if invested, shall be invested by, and at the risk of, the Certificate Administrator in Eligible Investments selected by the Certificate Administrator which shall mature, unless payable on demand, not later than such time on the Distribution Date which will allow the Certificate Administrator to make withdrawals from the Distribution Account under Section 5.3(b), and any such Eligible Investment shall not be sold or disposed of prior to its maturity unless payable on demand.  All such Eligible Investments shall be made in the name of "UxxPDSxxPD Bank National Association, as Trustee for the Holders of the Morgan Stanley Bank of America Merrill Lynch Trust 2013-C12, Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2013-C12."  None of the Depositor, the Mortgagors, the Special Servicer, the Master Servicer, the Custodian or the Trustee shall be liable for any loss incurred on such Eligible Investments.



 An amount equal to all income and gain realized from any such investment (to the extent not applied to offset losses on other investments) shall be paid to the Certificate







 Administrator as additional compensation and shall be subject to its withdrawal at any time from time to time.  The amount of any losses incurred in respect of any such investments shall be for the account of the Certificate Administrator which shall deposit the amount of such loss (to the extent not offset by income from other investments) in the Distribution Account, as the case may be, out of its own funds immediately as realized.  If the Certificate Administrator deposits in or transfers to the Distribution Account, as the case may be, any amount not required to be deposited therein or transferred thereto, it may at any time withdraw such amount or retransfer such amount from the Distribution Account, as the case may be, any provision herein to the contrary notwithstanding.



 (b)           The Certificate Administrator shall deposit into the Distribution Account, the Excess Liquidation Proceeds Reserve Account or the TA Unused Fees Reserve Account, as applicable, on the Business Day received all moneys remitted by the Master Servicer pursuant to this Agreement, including P&I Advances made by the Master Servicer and the Trustee, payments of Compensating Interest made by the Master Servicer and all Excess Liquidation Proceeds.  The Certificate Administrator shall deposit amounts constituting collections of Excess Interest on the Mortgage Loans into the Excess Interest Sub-account.  On any Master Servicer Remittance Date, the Master Servicer shall have no duty to remit to the Distribution Account any amounts other than amounts held in the Collection Account and collected during the related Collection Period as provided in clauses (v) and (xii) of Section 5.2(a)(I) and the P&I Advance Amount.



 Except with respect to the final Distribution Date, the Certificate Administrator, with respect to each Distribution Date occurring in January of each year (other than in any leap year and commencing in 2014) and February of each year (commencing in 2014), shall withdraw from the Distribution Account (to the extent of available funds) and deposit in the Interest Reserve Account in respect of each Interest Reserve Loan, an amount equal to one (1) day's interest at the related Net Mortgage Rate on the Stated Principal Balance of such Mortgage Loan as of the Due Date in the month in which such Distribution Date occurs, to the extent a Scheduled Payment or P&I Advance is timely made in respect thereof for such Due Date (all amounts so deposited in any January and February in respect of each Interest Reserve Loan, "Interest Reserve Amounts").



 The Certificate Administrator shall make withdrawals from the Distribution Account (including the Excess Interest Sub-account), the Excess Liquidation Proceeds Reserve Account and the TA Unused Fees Reserve Account only for the following purposes:



 (i)            to withdraw amounts deposited in the Distribution Account, the Excess Liquidation Proceeds Reserve Account and the TA Unused Fees Reserve Account in error and pay such amounts to the Persons entitled thereto;



 (ii)            in the case of the Distribution Account only, to pay any amounts payable to the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Trust Advisor, the Certificate Administrator, the Custodian and the Trustee any fees, indemnification payments, other expenses or other amounts permitted to be paid hereunder and not previously paid to such Persons pursuant to Section 5.2;







 (iii)           to make distributions to the Certificateholders pursuant to Sections 6.5, 6.10 and/or 11.1, as applicable;



 (iv)           in the case of the Distribution Account and the TA Unused Fees Reserve Account only, to reimburse the Trust Advisor for any indemnification payments or expenses payable to the Trust Advisor hereunder solely from amounts otherwise allocable to the Principal Balance Certificates that are not Control Eligible Certificates or Actual Recoveries of Trust Advisor Expenses or TA Unused Fees, in each case pursuant to, and subject to the limitations set forth in, this Agreement; and



 (v)           to clear and terminate the Distribution Account and the Reserve Accounts pursuant to Section 11.2.



 On each Master Servicer Remittance Date in March of every year commencing in March 2014 (and on any other Master Servicer Remittance Date related to the final Distribution Date), the Certificate Administrator shall withdraw all amounts then in the Interest Reserve Account and deposit such amounts into the Distribution Account.

Subject to Section 11.2(a), with respect to the final distribution on the Certificates, on each Distribution Date, the Certificate Administrator shall (1) first, withdraw from the Distribution Account and pay to the Trustee and Custodian any unpaid fees, expenses and other amounts then required to be paid pursuant to this Agreement, and then, to the Certificate Administrator, any unpaid fees, expenses and other amounts then required to be paid pursuant to this Agreement, and then at the written direction of the Master Servicer, withdraw from the Distribution Account and pay to the Master Servicer and Special Servicer any unpaid servicing compensation or other amounts currently required to be paid pursuant to this Agreement (to the extent not previously retained or withdrawn by the Master Servicer from the Collection Account), and (2) second, make distributions in the manner and amounts set forth below.



 Each distribution to Holders of Certificates shall be made by check mailed to such Holder's address as it appears on the Certificate Register of the Certificate Registrar or, upon written request to the Certificate Administrator on or prior to the related Record Date (or upon standing instructions given to the Certificate Administrator on the Closing Date prior to any Record Date, which instructions may be revoked at any time thereafter upon written notice to the Certificate Administrator five (5) days prior to the related Record Date) made by a Certificateholder by wire transfer in immediately available funds to an account specified in the request of such Certificateholder; provided, that (i) remittances to the Certificate Administrator shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the Distribution Account, the

If any payment required to be made on the Certificates is to be made on a day that is not a Business Day, then such payment will be made on the next succeeding Business Day without compensation for such delay.  All distributions or allocations made with respect to Holders of Certificates of a particular Class on each Distribution Date shall be made or allocated among the outstanding Certificates of such Class in proportion to their respective initial Certificate Balances, in the case of a Class of Principal Balance Certificates, or initial Notional Amounts, in the case of a Class of Class X Certificates, or Percentage Interests, in the case of the Class R Certificates.

The consent of Certificateholders shall not be required for any such withholding and any amount so withheld shall be regarded as distributed to the related Certificateholders for purposes of this Agreement.

 (ii)           from the portion of the Available Distribution Amount attributable to principal collected or advanced or deemed collected or advanced on or with respect to each Mortgage Loan (including each REO Mortgage Loan), to pay such principal with respect to the Corresponding REMIC I Regular Interest, until the REMIC I Principal Amount thereof is reduced to zero; and



 (iii)          from any remaining amount of the Available Distribution Amount (other than Excess Interest) and any remaining Excess Liquidation Proceeds with respect to each Mortgage Loan (including each REO Mortgage Loan), to reimburse, first, any unreimbursed Collateral Support Deficits previously allocated to the Corresponding REMIC I Regular Interest,

 (b)           At such time as all Distributable Interest with respect to the REMIC I Regular Interests has been paid, the REMIC I Principal Amounts of all of the REMIC I Regular Interests have been reduced to zero, and all Collateral Support Deficits (including interest thereon) previously allocated thereto to the REMIC I Regular Interests have been reimbursed, the Certificate Administrator shall pay to the Holders of the Class R Certificates with respect to the REMIC I Residual Interest any amounts of the Available Distribution Amount (other than Excess Interest) remaining with respect to each Mortgage Loan or, to the extent of the Trust's interest therein, the related REO Property.

 interest, principal, Prepayment Premiums or in reimbursement of previously allocated Collateral Support Deficits or Trust Advisor Expenses, then the corresponding distribution deemed to be made on a REMIC II Regular Interest shall be deemed to also be, respectively, a distribution of interest, principal, Prepayment Premiums or in reimbursement of previously allocated Collateral Support Deficits or Trust Advisor Expenses with respect to such REMIC II Regular Interest.

 (xxvii)      to make payments to the Holders of the Class H Certificates, to reimburse any unreimbursed Collateral Support Deficits previously allocated thereto and not previously fully reimbursed, plus any unpaid interest at the applicable Pass-Through Rate on such Collateral Support Deficits, in each case from the date allocated;



 (xxviii)     to each Class of Principal Balance Certificates (other than the Control Eligible Certificates) in sequential order as specified in clauses (i) through (xviii) above (taking into account the payment priority of the Class PST Certificates and treating each Class PST Component as if it were a separate Class), until all amounts of Trust Advisor Expenses (including Excess Trust Advisor Expenses) previously allocated to such Classes of Certificates, whether as a reduction of interest or as a reduction of the Aggregate Certificate Balance of such Class, but not previously reimbursed, have been reimbursed in full (it being understood that previously allocated Trust Advisor Expenses are not reimbursable as part of the reimbursement of previously allocated Collateral Support Deficits); and



 (xxix)        to make payments to the Holders of the Class R Certificates, up to the amount of any remaining portion of Available Distribution Amount on deposit in the Distribution Account.



 Notwithstanding the foregoing, on each Distribution Date occurring on or after the earliest date, if any, upon which the Aggregate Certificate Balance of all Classes of Subordinate Certificates has been reduced to zero, or the aggregate Appraisal Reduction in effect is greater than or equal to the Aggregate Certificate Balance of all Classes of Subordinate Certificates, distributions of principal pursuant to clause (ii) of this Section 6.5(a) will be made to the Holders of the Class A-1, Class A-2, Class A-SB, Class A-3 and Class A-4 Certificates, pro rata, based on the respective Aggregate Certificate Balances of such Classes of Certificates, in reduction of the respective Aggregate Certificate Balances of such Classes of Certificates, in







 an amount up to the Principal Distribution Amount for such Distribution Date, until the Aggregate Certificate Balance of each such Class is reduced to zero.



 All distributions of interest, if any, made with respect to any Class of Class X Certificates on any Distribution Date, pursuant to this Section 6.5(a), shall be made, and shall be deemed to have been made, in respect of the various Class X REMIC III Regular Interests that relate to the subject Class of Class X Certificates, pro rata in accordance with the respective amounts of Distributable Interest in respect of such Class X REMIC III Regular Interests for such Distribution Date.



 All amounts distributed to the Holders of the Exchangeable Certificates pursuant to the provisions set forth above will be deemed to have been distributed simultaneously by the Certificate Administrator to itself on behalf of the Trustee as the holder of, and on, the EC REMIC III Regular Interest with the same letter designation as the Class of Certificates (or, in the case of the Class PST Certificates, the same letter designation as the Class PST Component) on which such distribution was made.



 (b)           On each Distribution Date, the Certificate Administrator shall withdraw amounts in the Excess Liquidation Proceeds Reserve Account and make payments in the following priority:



 (i)            First, to reimburse the holders of the respective Classes of the REMIC III Regular Certificates and the EC REMIC III Regular Interests (and correspondingly, the applicable Exchangeable Certificates) (in the same order of priority that the Available Distribution Amount would be applied for this purpose) for any, and to the extent of, Unpaid Interest then owing to such Classes or EC REMIC III Regular Interests (and correspondingly, attributable to the applicable Exchangeable Certificates);



 (ii)           Second, to reimburse the holders of the Principal Balance Certificates (other than the Exchangeable Certificates) and the EC REMIC III Regular Interests (and correspondingly, the applicable Exchangeable Certificates) (in the same order of priority that the Available Distribution Amount would be applied for this purpose) for any, and to the extent of, unreimbursed Collateral Support Deficits previously allocated to them, together with interest on such Collateral Support Deficits at the applicable Pass-Through Rate, in each case from the date of allocation; and



 (iii)          Third, upon the reduction of the Aggregate Certificate Balance of the Principal Balance Certificates to zero, to pay any amounts remaining on deposit in such account, to the Holders of the Class R Certificates.



 (c)           On each Distribution Date, following application of amounts on deposit in the Excess Liquidation Proceeds Reserve Account as provided in Section 6.5(b), the Certificate Administrator shall withdraw any amounts on deposit in the TA Unused Fees Account and shall apply such amounts as follows:  first, to pay any current outstanding indemnification payments and other unreimbursed expenses payable to the Trust Advisor pursuant to this Agreement; second, to reimburse the holders of Class A Senior Certificates, EC REMIC III Regular Interests (and correspondingly, the applicable Exchangeable Certificates) and the Class D and Class E







 Certificates to the extent of any Trust Advisor Expenses that were actually applied to reduce the Distributable Certificate Interest of such Classes or EC REMIC III Regular Interests or the Aggregate Certificate Balance of such Classes and EC REMIC III Regular Interests (and correspondingly, the Aggregate Certificate Balance of the applicable Exchangeable Certificates), as applicable, on any Distribution Date, which amounts will be allocated first as recoveries of principal of such Classes or EC REMIC III Regular Interests (and correspondingly, the applicable Exchangeable Certificates), as applicable, in the reverse order (subject to the payment allocation priority of the Class PST Certificates set forth in Section 6.11) in which the applicable Excess Trust Advisor Expenses were allocated to reduce the respective Aggregate Certificate Balances of such Classes and EC REMIC III Regular Interests (and correspondingly, the Aggregate Certificate Balance of the applicable Exchangeable Certificates) and then as recoveries of interest shortfalls on such Classes (other than the Class A-1, Class A-2, Class A-SB, Class A-3, Class A-4 and Class A-S Certificates and the Class PST Component A-S), Class B REMIC III Regular Interest (and correspondingly, the applicable Exchangeable Certificates) and Class C REMIC III Regular Interest (and correspondingly, the applicable Exchangeable Certificates) in the reverse order (subject to the payment allocation priority of the Class PST Certificates set forth in Section 6.11) in which the applicable Trust Advisor Expenses were allocated to reduce Distributable Certificate Interest on such Classes or EC REMIC III Regular Interests; third, if such Distribution Date coincides with or follows the earlier of (x) the final Distribution Date and (y) the date that the Aggregate Certificate Balance of the Principal Balance Certificates, other than the Control Eligible Certificates, has been reduced to zero, to reimburse the holders of the Class A Senior Certificates, the EC REMIC III Regular Interests (and correspondingly, the applicable Exchangeable Certificates) and the Class D, Class E, Class F, Class G and Class H Certificates (in the same order of priority that the Available Distribution Amount would be applied for this purpose) for any, and to the extent of, unreimbursed Collateral Support Deficits previously allocated to such Classes or EC REMIC III Regular Interests, together with interest on such Collateral Support Deficits at the applicable Pass-Through Rate, in each case from the date of allocation; fourth, if such Distribution Date coincides with or follows the earlier of (x) the final Distribution Date and (y) the date that the Aggregate Certificate Balance of the Principal Balance Certificates, other than the Control Eligible Certificates, has been reduced to zero, to reimburse the Class A Senior Certificates, the EC REMIC III Regular Interests (and correspondingly, the applicable Exchangeable Certificates) and the Class D, Class E, Class F, Class G, Class H and Class X Certificates (in the same order of priority that the Available Distribution Amount would be applied for this purpose) for any, and to the extent of, Unpaid Interest due and owing to such Classes or EC REMIC III Regular Interests; and fifth, upon the reduction of the Aggregate Certificate Balance of the Principal Balance Certificates to zero, to pay any amounts remaining on deposit in such account, to the Holders of the Class R Certificates.



 (d)           On each Distribution Date, the Certificate Administrator shall withdraw from the Excess Interest Sub-account any Excess Interest on deposit therein, and the Certificate Administrator shall pay such Excess Interest on such Distribution Date to the Holders of the Class H Certificates (even if the Aggregate Certificate Balance of the Class H Certificates has been reduced to zero for any reason).

On each Distribution Date, the amount of any Net Aggregate Prepayment Interest Shortfall for such Distribution Date shall be allocated among the respective REMIC II Regular Interests, pro rata in proportion to the Accrued Interest for each REMIC II Regular Interest for such Distribution Date and shall reduce Distributable Interest for each REMIC II Regular Interest in accordance with the definition of "Distributable Interest".  On each Distribution Date, the amount of any Net Aggregate Prepayment Interest Shortfall for such Distribution Date shall be allocated among the respective Classes of the REMIC III Regular Certificates and the EC REMIC III Regular Interests (and, correspondingly, the applicable Exchangeable Certificates), pro rata in proportion to the amount of Accrued Certificate Interest payable to each such Class of REMIC III Regular Certificates or EC REMIC III Regular Interest for such Distribution Date and shall reduce the Distributable Certificate Interest for each such Class of REMIC III Regular Certificates or EC REMIC III Regular Interest for such Distribution Date in accordance with the definition of "Distributable Certificate Interest".  On each Distribution Date, the amount of any Net Aggregate Prepayment Interest Shortfall for such Distribution Date allocated to the Class A-S REMIC III Regular Interest shall be allocated between the Class A-S Certificates and the Class PST Component A-S, pro rata, based on the Class A-S Percentage Interest and the Class A-S-PST Percentage Interest, respectively, in the Class A-S REMIC III Regular Interest.

 REMIC III Regular Interest for such Distributable Date in accordance with the definition of "Distributable Interest".  No Prepayment Interest Shortfall with respect to a Serviced Companion Loan or a B Note shall be allocated to any Class of Certificates.



 Section 6.8     Adjustment of Master Servicing Fees.  The Master Servicing Fee payable to the Master Servicer shall be adjusted as provided in Section 5.2(a)(I)(iv) herein.

The Master Servicer shall deposit in the Distribution Account prior to each Distribution Date any Compensating Interest for such Distribution Date not covered by the foregoing adjustment to Master Servicing Fees.



 Section 6.9     Appraisal Reductions.  If an Appraisal Event occurs, the Special Servicer shall obtain (and shall use reasonable efforts to obtain within sixty (60) days of such Appraisal Event) (A) an Appraisal (which the Special Servicer shall use reasonable best efforts to order within fifteen (15) calendar days of the occurrence of the related Appraisal Event) of the Mortgaged Property securing the related Mortgage Loan (other than any Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan), Loan Pair or A/B Whole Loan, if the Stated Principal Balance of such Mortgage Loan, Loan Pair or A/B Whole Loan exceeds $2,000,000 or (B) at the option of the Special Servicer, if such Stated Principal Balance is less than or equal to $2,000,000, either an internal valuation prepared by the Special Servicer in accordance with MAI standards or an Appraisal; provided that if the Special Servicer had completed or obtained an Appraisal or internal valuation within the immediately prior nine (9) months, the Special Servicer may rely on such Appraisal or internal valuation and shall have no duty to prepare a new Appraisal or internal valuation, unless the Special Servicer is aware of any material change to the related Mortgaged Property, its earnings potential or risk characteristics, or marketability, or market conditions that have occurred that would affect the validity of the appraisal or valuation; and provided, further, that an updated Appraisal shall not be required with respect to any Mortgage Loan, and an Appraisal Reduction will not be required, so long as a debt service reserve, letter of credit, guaranty or surety bond is available and has the ability to pay off the then Unpaid Principal Balance of the subject Mortgage Loan in full except to the extent that the Special Servicer, in accordance with the Servicing Standard, determines that obtaining an Appraisal is in the best interests of the Certificateholders.  The Special Servicer shall update such Appraisal or valuation in accordance with the definition of "market value" as set forth in 12 CxxPDFxxPDRxxPD  225.62 at least annually, and shall use reasonable efforts to do so within thirty (30) days of each annual anniversary of the related Appraisal Event, to the extent such Mortgage Loan remains a Required Appraisal Loan.  The cost of any such Appraisal or valuation, if not performed by the Special Servicer, shall be an expense of the Trust (and any related B Note) and may be paid from REO Income or, to the extent collections from such related Mortgage Loan, B Note, Loan Pair or Mortgaged Property does not cover the expense, such unpaid expense shall be, subject to Section 4.4 hereof, advanced by the Master Servicer at the request of the Special Servicer or by the Special Servicer pursuant to Section 4.2 in which event it shall be treated as a Servicing Advance.  The Special Servicer, based on the Appraisal or internal valuation prepared or obtained by the Special Servicer and receipt of information requested by the Special Servicer from the Master Servicer pursuant to this Section 6.9, shall calculate any Appraisal Reduction and promptly report such amount to the Master Servicer, the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator, the Controlling Class Representative (during any Subordinate Control Period and any Collective Consultation Period)







 and the Trust Advisor.  The Special Servicer shall calculate or recalculate the Appraisal Reduction for any Mortgage Loan (other than any Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan), B Note and Loan Pair based on updated Appraisals or internal valuations prepared or obtained from time to time by the Special Servicer and report such amount to the Master Servicer, the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator, the Controlling Class Representative (during any Subordinate Control Period and any Collective Consultation Period) and the Trust Advisor annually.  The Master Servicer shall provide the Special Servicer with information (via electronic delivery) in its possession that is required to calculate or recalculate any Appraisal Reduction pursuant to the definition thereof, using reasonable efforts to deliver such information within four (4) Business Days of the Special Servicer's written request (which request shall be made promptly, but in no event later than ten (10) Business Days, after the Special Servicer's receipt of the applicable Appraisal or preparation of the applicable internal valuation); provided the Special Servicer's failure to timely make such request shall not relieve the Master Servicer of its obligation to provide such information to the Special Servicer in the manner and timing set forth in this sentence.  The Master Servicer shall not calculate Appraisal Reductions.



 On each and every day following the Closing Date, the then Aggregate Certificate Balance of each Class of the Principal Balance Certificates and each EC REMIC III Regular Interest shall be notionally reduced (for purposes of determining the identity of the Controlling Class, whether a Subordinate Control Period, a Collective Consultation Period or a Senior Consultation Period is then in effect and, as and to the extent contemplated by the definition of "Voting Rights", the allocation of Voting Rights among the respective Classes of Principal Balance Certificates) to the extent of the then existing Appraisal Reduction(s) (without giving effect to, and exclusive of, any Appraisal Reduction calculated pursuant to the last sentence of the definition of "Appraisal Reduction" (other than the proviso contained in such sentence)) allocable to such Class or EC REMIC III Regular Interest.  The aggregate Appraisal Reduction as of any date of determination shall be applied (solely for purposes of determining the identity of the Controlling Class, whether a Subordinate Control Period, a Collective Consultation Period or a Senior Consultation Period is then in effect and, as and to the extent contemplated by the definition of "Voting Rights", the allocation of Voting Rights among the respective Classes of Principal Balance Certificates) to notionally reduce the respective Aggregate Certificate Balances of the various Classes of Principal Balance Certificates and the EC REMIC III Regular Interests in the following order of priority:  first, to the Class H Certificates; second, to the Class G Certificates; third, to the Class F Certificates; fourth, to the Class E Certificates; fifth, to the Class D Certificates; sixth, to the Class C Certificates (and correspondingly, to the Class C Certificates and the Class PST Certificates, pro rata, based on the Class C Percentage Interest and the Class C-PST Percentage Interest, respectively, in the Class C REMIC III Regular Interest); seventh, to the Class B REMIC III Regular Interest (and correspondingly, to the Class B Certificates and the Class PST Certificates, pro rata, based on the Class B Percentage Interest and the Class B-PST Percentage Interest, respectively, in the Class B REMIC III Regular Interest); eighth, to the Class A-S REMIC III Regular Interest (and correspondingly, to the Class A-S Certificates and the Class PST Certificates, pro rata, based on the Class A-S Percentage Interest and the Class A-S-PST Percentage Interest, respectively, in the Class A-S REMIC III Regular Interest); and finally, pro rata to the (i) Class A-1 Certificates, (ii) Class A-2 Certificates, (iii) Class A-SB Certificates, (iv) Class A-3 Certificates and (v) the Class A-4 Certificates based on their respective Aggregate Certificate Balances (provided in each case that no Aggregate Certificate Balance in respect of any such Class may be notionally reduced below zero).  With







 respect to any Appraisal Reduction calculated for the purposes of determining the identity of the Controlling Class, the appraised value of the related Mortgaged Property shall be determined on an "as-is" basis.  If all or any portion of an Appraisal Reduction ceases to exist as of any date of determination, then such Appraisal Reduction or applicable portion thereof shall no longer thereafter be applied in accordance with the foregoing two (2) sentences to notionally reduce the Aggregate Certificate Balance of any Class of Principal Balance Certificates or EC REMIC III Regular Interest, and (consistent with the foregoing) the Aggregate Certificate Balances of the applicable Classes of Principal Balance Certificates, the Class A-S REMIC III Regular Interest (and correspondingly, the Aggregate Certificate Balance of the Class A-S Certificates and the Class PST Certificates, pro rata, based on the Class A-S Percentage Interest and the Class A-S-PST Percentage Interest, respectively, in the Class A-S REMIC III Regular Interest), the Class B REMIC III Regular Interest (and correspondingly, the Aggregate Certificate Balance of the Class B Certificates and the Class PST Certificates, pro rata, based on the Class B Percentage Interest and the Class B-PST Percentage Interest, respectively, in the Class B REMIC III Regular Interest) and the Class C REMIC III Regular Interest (and correspondingly, the Aggregate Certificate Balance of the Class C Certificates and the Class PST Certificates, pro rata, based on the Class C Percentage Interest and the Class C-PST Percentage Interest, respectively, in the Class C REMIC III Regular Interest) shall be notionally restored to the extent such Appraisal Reduction or portion thereof ceases to exist.



 Any Appraisal Reduction with respect to an A/B Whole Loan shall be allocated to notionally reduce the outstanding principal balance of the related B Note prior to any allocation to the related A Note.



 Any Appraisal Reduction with respect to a Loan Pair shall be allocated between the related Mortgage Loan and the related Serviced Companion Loan on a pro rata basis by Unpaid Principal Balance.  The Master Servicer shall deliver to the Special Servicer notice of the occurrence of an Appraisal Event promptly following the Master Servicer's knowledge of the occurrence thereof, and the Special Servicer shall deliver to the Master Servicer notice of the occurrence of an Appraisal Event promptly following the Special Servicer's knowledge of the occurrence thereof.  With respect to any Loan Pair, the Master Servicer shall deliver to any related Other Master Servicer, Other Special Servicer and Other Trustee (i) notice of the occurrence of any Appraisal Event in respect of such Loan Pair promptly following its knowledge, or receipt of notice from the Special Servicer, of the occurrence thereof and (ii) a statement of any Appraisal Reduction in respect of such Loan Pair promptly following its receipt from the Special Servicer of the calculation or recalculation thereof.



 The Holders of the majority (based on Certificate Balance) of any Class of Control Eligible Certificates the Aggregate Certificate Balance of which has been reduced to less than 25% of the initial Aggregate Certificate Balance thereof as a result of an allocation of Appraisal Reductions in respect of such Class (such Class, an "Appraised-Out Class") shall have the right, at their sole expense, to present to the Special Servicer a second (2nd) Appraisal of the Mortgaged Property securing any Required Appraisal Loan (other than any Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan) (such holders, the "Requesting Holders") prepared by an Independent MAI appraiser on an "as-is" basis and acceptable to the Special Servicer in accordance with the Servicing Standard.  Upon receipt of such second (2nd) Appraisal, the Special Servicer shall determine, in accordance with the Servicing Standard, whether, based on its assessment of such







 second (2nd) Appraisal, any recalculation of the applicable Appraisal Reduction is warranted and, if so warranted, shall recalculate such Appraisal Reduction based upon such second (2nd) Appraisal.  Any Appraised-Out Class(es) (together with any other Classes of Control Eligible Certificates affected by such Appraisal Reduction) shall have the related Aggregate Certificate Balance(s) notionally restored to the extent required by such recalculation of the Appraisal Reduction, and there will be a redetermination of whether a Subordinate Control Period, a Collective Consultation Period or a Senior Consultation Period is then in effect, as applicable.  The right of any Appraised-Out Class to present a second (2nd) Appraisal in connection with any Required Appraisal Loan is limited to one Appraisal with respect to each Mortgaged Property relating to such Required Appraisal Loan.



 In addition, if subsequent to a Class of Control Eligible Certificates becoming an Appraised-Out Class there is a material change with respect to any of the Mortgaged Properties related to the Appraisal Reduction that caused such Class to become an Appraised-Out Class, the applicable Requesting Holders shall have the right (except in the case of a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan), at their sole expense, to present to the Special Servicer an additional Appraisal prepared by an Independent MAI appraiser on an "as-is" basis and acceptable to the Special Servicer in accordance with the Servicing Standard.  Subject to the Special Servicer's confirmation, determined in accordance with the Servicing Standard, that there has been a change with respect to the related Mortgaged Property and such change was material, the Special Servicer shall determine, in accordance with the Servicing Standard, whether, based on its assessment of such additional Appraisal, any recalculation of the applicable Appraisal Reduction is warranted and, if so warranted, shall recalculate such Appraisal Reduction based upon such additional Appraisal.  Any Appraised-Out Class(es) (together with any other Classes of Control Eligible Certificates affected by such Appraisal Reduction) shall have the related Aggregate Certificate Balance(s) notionally restored to the extent required by such recalculation of the Appraisal Reduction, and there shall be a redetermination of whether a Subordinate Control Period, a Collective Consultation Period or a Senior Consultation Period is then in effect, as applicable.  With respect to each Class of Control Eligible Certificates, the right to present the Special Servicer with additional Appraisals as provided in this paragraph is limited to no more frequently than once in any 12-month period.



 Appraisals that are permitted to be presented by any Appraised-Out Class will be in addition to any Appraisals that the Special Servicer may otherwise be required to obtain in accordance with the Servicing Standard upon the occurrence of such material change or that the Special Servicer is otherwise required or permitted to order under this Agreement without regard to any appraisal requests made by any Requesting Holder.



 Any Appraised-Out Class shall not be entitled to exercise any rights of the Controlling Class until such time, if any, as such Class is reinstated as the Controlling Class; and the rights of the Controlling Class will be exercised by the Holders of the next most senior Class of Control Eligible Certificates that is not an Appraised-Out Class, if any.



 Copies of all Appraisals and other Third Party Reports obtained pursuant to this Agreement by the Special Servicer or the Master Servicer with respect to any Mortgaged Property shall be delivered (in electronic format or hard copy) to the other such servicer and to







 the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator (in electronic format), the 17g-5 Information Provider (in electronic format) and the Trust Advisor.



 Section 6.10     Prepayment Premiums.  Any Prepayment Premium collected with respect to a Mortgage Loan (but not a B Note or Serviced Companion Loan, which Prepayment Premium is payable to the holder of the related B Note or the related Serviced Companion Loan, as applicable) during any particular Collection Period will be distributed by the Certificate Administrator on the following Distribution Date as follows:



 (i)           The respective Classes of the Class A-1, Class A-2, Class A-SB, Class A-3, Class A-4 and Class D Certificates and the EC REMIC III Regular Interests (and correspondingly, the applicable Exchangeable Certificates) then entitled to distributions of principal from the Principal Distribution Amount for such Distribution Date will be entitled to, and the Certificate Administrator on behalf of the Trustee will pay to such Classes and EC REMIC III Regular Interests, an amount equal to, in the case of each such Class or EC REMIC III Regular Interest, the product of (A) a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount distributed as principal to that Class or EC REMIC III Regular Interest on that Distribution Date, and the denominator of which is the total amount distributed as principal to the Holders of all Classes of Principal Balance Certificates (other than the Exchangeable Certificates) and EC REMIC III Regular Interests on that Distribution Date, multiplied by (B) the Base Interest Fraction for the related Principal Prepayment and that Class or EC REMIC III Regular Interest, multiplied by (C) the amount of the Prepayment Premium collected in respect of such Principal Prepayment during the related Collection Period.



 (ii)          Any portion of any such Prepayment Premium that is not so distributed to any of the Class A-1, Class A-2, Class A-SB, Class A-3, Class A-4 or Class D Certificates or EC REMIC III Regular Interests (and correspondingly, the applicable Exchangeable Certificates) in accordance with the immediately preceding clause (i) distributed (the applicable "Class X YM Distribution Amount") will be distributed to the Holders of the respective Classes of the Class X Certificates as follows:  first, to the Holders of the Class X-A Certificates in an amount equal to the product of (A) a fraction, the numerator of which is the total amount distributed as principal to the Class A Senior Certificates and the Class A-S REMIC III Regular Interest (and correspondingly, the Class A-S Certificates and the Class PST Component A-S) on the applicable Distribution Date, and the denominator of which is the total amount distributed as principal to the Holders of all Classes of Principal Balance Certificates (other than the Exchangeable Certificates) and EC REMIC III Regular Interests on the applicable Distribution Date, multiplied by (B) the applicable Class X YM Distribution Amount; and then, to the Holders of the Class X-C Certificates in an amount equal to any portion of the applicable Class X YM Distribution Amount remaining after the foregoing distribution to the Holders of the Class X-A Certificates.



 All distributions of Prepayment Premiums, if any, made with respect to a Class of Class X Certificates on any Distribution Date, pursuant to this Section 6.10, shall be made, and shall be deemed to have been made, in respect of the various Class X REMIC III Regular Interests that relate to the subject Class of Class X Certificates, pro rata in accordance with the respective amounts by which the Notional Amounts of such Class X REMIC III Regular Interests declined on such Distribution Date.

 Section 6.11     Allocation of Trust Advisor Expenses.



 (a)           On each Distribution Date, immediately prior to the distributions to be made to the Certificateholders for such Distribution Date pursuant to Section 6.5(a), the Certificate Administrator shall allocate Trust Advisor Expenses to reduce the Distributable Certificate Interest for such Distribution Date for the Class E and Class D Certificates, the Class C REMIC III Regular Interest (and correspondingly, the Class C Certificates and the Class PST Certificates, pro rata, based on the Class C Percentage Interest and the Class C-PST Percentage Interest, respectively, in the Class C REMIC III Regular Interest) and the Class B REMIC III Regular Interest (and correspondingly, the Class B Certificates and the Class PST Certificates, pro rata, based on the Class B Percentage Interest and the Class B-PST Percentage Interest, respectively, in the Class B REMIC III Regular Interest), in that order, in each case, until the Distributable Certificate Interest of such Class for such Distribution Date has been reduced to zero.  Trust Advisor Expenses shall not be allocated to reduce interest distributable to the Class A Senior Certificates, the Class A-S REMIC III Regular Interest (or, correspondingly, the Class A-S Certificates or the Class PST Component A-S), the Class X Certificates, the Control Eligible Certificates or any B Note or Serviced Companion Loan.



 To the extent that the amount of Trust Advisor Expenses payable with respect to any Distribution Date is greater than the aggregate amount of Distributable Certificate Interest otherwise distributable on the Class B REMIC III Regular Interest, the Class C REMIC III Regular Interest and the Class D and Class E Certificates for such Distribution Date, the resulting Excess Trust Advisor Expenses shall reduce the Principal Distribution Amount otherwise allocable to the Principal Balance Certificates (other than Exchangeable Certificates) that are not Control Eligible Certificates for such Distribution Date and the EC REMIC III Regular Interests.  In addition, such Excess Trust Advisor Expenses shall be allocated to reduce the Aggregate Certificate Balances of the respective Classes of Principal Balance Certificates (other than the Exchangeable Certificates) that are not Control Eligible Certificates, the Certificate Balance of the Class A-S REMIC III Regular Interest (and correspondingly, the Aggregate Certificate Balance of the Class A-S and Class PST Certificates, pro rata as set forth below), the Certificate







 Balance of the Class B REMIC III Regular Interest (and correspondingly, the Aggregate Certificate Balance of the Class B and Class PST Certificates, pro rata as set forth below) and the Certificate Balance of the Class C REMIC III Regular Interest (and correspondingly, the Aggregate Certificate Balance of the Class C and Class PST Certificates, pro rata as set forth below) up to the aggregate amount of such reduction of the Principal Distribution Amount in the following order:  first, to the Class E Certificates and the Class D Certificates, in that order, in each case until the remaining Aggregate Certificate Balance of such Class of Certificates has been reduced to zero, second, to the Class C REMIC III Regular Interest (and correspondingly, the Class C Certificates and the Class PST Certificates, pro rata, based on the Class C Percentage Interest and the Class C-PST Percentage Interest, respectively, in the Class C REMIC III Regular Interest) until the Certificate Balance of the Class C REMIC III Regular Interest has been reduced to zero, third, to the Class B REMIC III Regular Interest (and correspondingly, the Class B Certificates and the Class PST Certificates, pro rata, based on the Class B Percentage Interest and the Class B-PST Percentage Interest, respectively, in the Class B REMIC III Regular Interest) until the Certificate Balance of the Class B REMIC III Regular Interest has been reduced to zero, fourth, to the Class A-S REMIC III Regular Interest (and correspondingly, the Class A-S Certificates and the Class PST Certificates, pro rata, based on the Class A-S Percentage Interest and the Class A-S-PST Percentage Interest, respectively, in the Class A-S REMIC III Regular Interest) until the Certificate Balance of the Class A-S REMIC III Regular Interest has been reduced to zero; and then, among the respective Classes of Class A Senior Certificates, pro rata (based upon their respective Aggregate Certificate Balances), until the remaining Aggregate Certificate Balances of the Class A Senior Certificates have been reduced to zero.



 Any Trust Advisor Expenses (including Excess Trust Advisor Expenses) allocated to a Class of Certificates (including any of the Exchangeable Certificates following the prior corresponding allocation to the related EC REMIC III Regular Interest) shall be allocated among the respective Certificates of such Class in proportion to the Percentage Interests evidenced by such Certificates.  If amounts distributable in respect of the Distributable Certificate Interest to the Class B REMIC III Regular Interest, Class C REMIC III Regular Interest and the Class D and Class E Certificates and otherwise available as the indicated portion of the Principal Distribution Amount are insufficient to reimburse any related Trust Advisor Expenses on a Distribution Date, any unreimbursed Trust Advisor Expenses shall remain unreimbursed until the next Distribution Date that such applicable amounts are available.  In no event shall any Trust Advisor Expenses (including Excess Trust Advisor Expenses) reduce or delay any principal or interest payable in respect of the Control Eligible Certificates.



 (b)           On any Distribution Date, the amount reimbursable to the Trust Advisor in respect of Trust Advisor Expenses for such Distribution Date shall not exceed the sum of (i) the portion of the Principal Distribution Amount for such Distribution Date otherwise distributable to the Principal Balance Certificates that are not Control Eligible Certificates and (ii) the aggregate amount of Distributable Certificate Interest (for such purposes, calculated without regard to any reductions therein as a result of Trust Advisor Expenses for such Distribution Date) that would otherwise be distributable to the Class B, Class PST (in respect of Class PST Component B or Class PST Component C), Class C, Class D and Class E Certificates for such Distribution Date.  Any amount of Trust Advisor Expenses that are not reimbursed on a







 Distribution Date shall be payable on the next Distribution Date to the extent funds are sufficient, in accordance with this Section 6.11(b), to make such payments.



 (c)           To the extent any Actual Recoveries of Trust Advisor Expenses are received during any Collection Period, such amounts shall be allocated first, as an increase in the Aggregate Certificate Balance of each applicable Class of Certificates or EC REMIC III Regular Interest in the reverse order in which the Excess Trust Advisor Expenses were allocated in reduction of the Aggregate Certificate Balance of the Class A Senior Certificates, the Class D Certificates, the Class E Certificates and/or any EC REMIC III Regular Interest pursuant to Section 6.11(a), with a corresponding increase in the Principal Distribution Amount for the related Distribution Date in the aggregate amount of such increases to such Aggregate Certificate Balances and then, as an increase in the Distributable Certificate Interest for the related Distribution Date in respect of the Class B REMIC III Regular Interest (and correspondingly, the portions thereof distributable on the Class B Certificates and the Class PST Certificates, pro rata, based on the Class B Percentage Interest and the Class B-PST Percentage Interest, respectively, in the Class B REMIC III Regular Interest), Class C REMIC III Regular Interest (and correspondingly, the portions thereof distributable on the Class C Certificates and the Class PST Certificates, pro rata, based on the Class C Percentage Interest and the Class C-PST Percentage Interest, respectively, in the Class C REMIC III Regular Interest), Class D Certificates and Class E Certificates, in that order, in each case, up to an amount equal to the aggregate reduction of the subject Class's or EC REMIC III Regular Interest's Distributable Certificate Interest for all prior Distribution Dates (including as payment to a more senior Class of Certificates or EC REMIC III Regular Interest in respect of interest shortfalls created by previously allocated Trust Advisor Expenses), to the extent not previously reimbursed.



 On each Distribution Date, if and to the extent that Trust Advisor Expenses have been allocated to the Class B REMIC III Regular Interest on any prior Distribution Date in reduction of the Distributable Certificate Interest for such EC REMIC III Regular Interest, and such reductions in Distributable Certificate Interest for such EC REMIC III Regular Interest have not been previously reimbursed, then the Class B REMIC III Regular Interest (and correspondingly, the Class B Certificates and the Class PST Certificates, pro rata, based on the Class B Percentage Interest and the Class B-PST Percentage Interest, respectively, in the Class B REMIC III Regular Interest) will be entitled to reimbursement for the Trust Advisor Expense Interest Shortfall in respect of the Class B REMIC III Regular Interest for such Distribution Date (with a corresponding increase in the Distributable Certificate Interest with respect to the Class B REMIC III Regular Interest for such Distribution Date):  first, out of amounts otherwise distributable as interest to the Holders of the Class E Certificates for such Distribution Date, up to (and with a corresponding reduction in) the Distributable Certificate Interest with respect to the Class E Certificates for such Distribution Date (calculated for purposes of this paragraph without regard to clause (A)(3) of the definition of "Distributable Certificate Interest"); second, out of amounts otherwise distributable as interest to the Holders of the Class D Certificates for such Distribution Date, up to (and with a corresponding reduction in) the Distributable Certificate Interest with respect to the Class D Certificates for such Distribution Date (calculated for purposes of this paragraph without regard to clause (A)(3) of the definition of "Distributable Certificate Interest"); and third, out of amounts otherwise distributable as interest to the Class C REMIC III Regular Interest (and correspondingly, the portions thereof distributable on the Class C Certificates and the Class PST Certificates, pro rata, based on the Class C Percentage Interest







 and the Class C-PST Percentage Interest, respectively, in the Class C REMIC III Regular Interest) for such Distribution Date, up to (and with a corresponding reduction in) the Distributable Certificate Interest with respect to the Class C REMIC III Regular Interest (and correspondingly, the portions thereof distributable on the Class C Certificates and the Class PST Certificates, pro rata, based on the Class C Percentage Interest and the Class C-PST Percentage Interest, respectively, in the Class C REMIC III Regular Interest) for such Distribution Date (calculated for purposes of this paragraph without regard to clause (A)(3) of the definition of "Distributable Certificate Interest").



 On each Distribution Date, if and to the extent that Trust Advisor Expenses have been allocated to the Class C REMIC III Regular Interest on any prior Distribution Date in reduction of the Distributable Certificate Interest for such EC REMIC III Regular Interest, and such reductions in Distributable Certificate Interest for such EC REMIC III Regular Interest have not been previously reimbursed, then the Class C REMIC III Regular Interest (and correspondingly, the Class C Certificates and the Class PST Certificates, pro rata, based on the Class C Percentage Interest and the Class C-PST Percentage Interest, respectively, in the Class C REMIC III Regular Interest) will be entitled to reimbursement for the Trust Advisor Expense Interest Shortfall in respect of the Class C REMIC III Regular Interest for such Distribution Date (with a corresponding increase in the Distributable Certificate Interest with respect to the Class C REMIC III Regular Interest for such Distribution Date):  first, out of amounts otherwise distributable as interest to the Holders of the Class E Certificates for such Distribution Date, up to (and with a corresponding reduction in) the Distributable Certificate Interest with respect to the Class E Certificates for such Distribution Date (calculated for purposes of this paragraph without regard to clause (A)(3) of the definition of "Distributable Certificate Interest"), reduced by any reimbursement made on such Distribution Date to the Class B REMIC III Regular Interest pursuant to the prior paragraph out of amounts otherwise distributable as interest to the Holders of the Class E Certificates; and second, out of amounts otherwise distributable as interest to the Holders of the Class D Certificates for such Distribution Date, up to (and with a corresponding reduction in) the Distributable Certificate Interest with respect to the Class D Certificates for such Distribution Date (calculated for purposes of this paragraph without regard to clause (A)(3) of the definition of "Distributable Certificate Interest"), reduced by any reimbursement made on such Distribution Date to the Class B REMIC III Regular Interest pursuant to the prior paragraph out of amounts otherwise distributable as interest to the Holders of the Class D Certificates.



 On each Distribution Date, if and to the extent that Trust Advisor Expenses have been allocated to the Class D Certificates on any prior Distribution Date in reduction of the Distributable Certificate Interest for such Class, and such reductions in Distributable Certificate Interest for such Class have not been previously reimbursed, then the Holders of the Class D Certificates will be entitled to reimbursement for the Trust Advisor Expense Interest Shortfall in respect of the Class D Certificates for such Distribution Date (with a corresponding increase in the Distributable Certificate Interest with respect to the Class D Certificates for such Distribution Date) out of amounts otherwise distributable as interest to the Holders of the Class E Certificates for such Distribution Date, up to (and with a corresponding reduction in) the Distributable Certificate Interest with respect to the Class E Certificates for such Distribution Date (calculated for purposes of this paragraph without regard to clause (A)(3) of the definition of "Distributable Certificate Interest"), reduced by any reimbursement made on such Distribution Date to the Class







 B REMIC III Regular Interest and/or Class C REMIC III Regular Interest pursuant to the prior two (2) paragraphs out of amounts otherwise distributable as interest to the Holders of the Class E Certificates.



 Any reimbursement made out of amounts otherwise distributable as interest to the Class C REMIC III Regular Interest or the Class D or Class E Certificates on any Distribution Date pursuant to any of the prior three (3) paragraphs, shall be deemed an allocation to such Class or EC REMIC III Regular Interest of the Trust Advisor Expenses being reimbursed to the Holders of a more senior Class of Certificates or the applicable EC REMIC III Regular Interest (and correspondingly, the Holders of the related Classes of Exchangeable Certificates).



 (d)           On each Distribution Date, if any Trust Advisor Expense is allocated to the Class B REMIC III Regular Interest, the Class C REMIC III Regular Interest or the Class D or Class E Certificates in reduction of the Distributable Certificate Interest of such Class of Certificates or EC REMIC III Regular Interest for such Distribution Date, then such Trust Advisor Expense will be deemed allocated to the Corresponding REMIC II Regular Interest in reduction of the Distributable Interest of such Corresponding REMIC II Regular Interest for such Distribution Date.  In addition, on each Distribution Date, if any Excess Trust Advisor Expense is allocated to the Class A Senior Certificates, an EC REMIC III Regular Interest or the Class D or Class E Certificates in reduction of the Aggregate Certificate Balance of such Class of Certificates or EC REMIC III Regular Interest, then such Excess Trust Advisor Expense will be deemed allocated to the Corresponding REMIC II Regular Interest in reduction of the REMIC II Principal Amount of such Corresponding REMIC II Regular Interest.



 (e)           For the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, each of the parties hereto acknowledges and agrees (and each Certificateholder, by its acceptance of such Certificate, is deemed to acknowledge and agree) that all calculations to be made hereunder in respect of the entitlement of the Control Eligible Certificates to receive interest, principal and other amounts (including P&I Advances in respect to the Control Eligible Certificates) shall be made such that (i) the Control Eligible Certificates shall be paid the amounts to which they are entitled on each Distribution Date as if no Trust Advisor Expenses had been incurred, reimbursed or reimbursable, and (ii) in no event shall any Trust Advisor Expenses reduce or delay in any manner any principal, interest or other amounts (including P&I Advances) payable or reimbursable to the Control Eligible Certificates.

 Section 7.6     Resignation and Removal of the Trustee, the Custodian or the Certificate Administrator.



 (a)           The Trustee, the Custodian or the Certificate Administrator may at any time resign and be discharged from the trusts hereby created by giving written notice thereof to







 the other such party, the Depositor, the Master Servicer, the Trust Advisor, each holder of a B Note or Serviced Companion Loan and the 17g-5 Information Provider; provided that such resignation shall not be effective until its successor shall have accepted the appointment.  The Trustee, the Custodian and the Certificate Administrator, as applicable, shall bear all costs associated with its respective resignation and the appointment of a successor trustee, custodian or certificate administrator, as applicable.  Upon receiving such notice of resignation, the Depositor shall promptly appoint a successor trustee, custodian or certificate administrator, as the case may be, except in the case of the initial Trustee and Certificate Administrator, in which case both shall be so replaced but may be replaced under this paragraph sequentially, by written instrument, one copy of which instrument shall be delivered to the resigning Trustee, one copy to the successor trustee and one copy to each of the Master Servicer, the Custodian, the Certificate Administrator and, subject to Section 5.7, the Rating Agencies.  If no successor trustee, custodian or certificate administrator shall have been so appointed, as the case may be, and shall have accepted appointment within thirty (30) days after the giving of such notice of resignation, the resigning Trustee, Custodian or Certificate Administrator, as the case may be, may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor trustee, custodian or certificate administrator, as the case may be.  It shall be a condition to the appointment of a successor trustee, custodian or certificate administrator that such entity satisfies the eligibility requirements set forth in Section 7.5 and if, and for so long as, the Trust or, with respect to any Serviced Companion Loan, the trust created pursuant to an Other Companion Loan Pooling and Servicing Agreement, are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, such appointment shall have been consented to by the Depositor or the depositor under the Other Companion Loan Pooling and Servicing Agreement, as the case may be (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld).



 (b)           If at any time (i) the Trustee shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of Section 7.5(a) and shall fail to resign after written request therefor by the Depositor, (ii) the Trustee shall become incapable of acting, or shall be adjudged a bankrupt or insolvent, or a receiver of the Trustee or of its property shall be appointed, or any public officer shall take charge or control of the Trustee or of its property or affairs for the purpose of rehabilitation, conservation or liquidation, (iii) a tax is imposed or threatened with respect to the Trust or any REMIC Pool by any state in which the Trustee or the Trust held by the Trustee is located solely because of the location of the Trustee in such state; provided, that, if the Trustee agrees to indemnify the Trust for such taxes, it shall not be removed pursuant to this clause (iii), or (iv) the continuation of the Trustee as such would result in a downgrade, qualification or withdrawal of the rating by the Rating Agencies of any Class of Certificates with a rating as evidenced in writing by the Rating Agencies, then the Depositor may remove such Trustee and appoint a successor trustee by written instrument, one copy of which instrument shall be delivered to the Trustee so removed, one copy to the successor trustee and one copy to each of the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Custodian, the Certificate Administrator and the 17g-5 Information Provider.  In the case of removal under clauses (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) above, the Trustee shall bear all such costs of transfer.  Such succession shall take effect after a successor trustee has been appointed.  If the Trust, or any Other Securitization that holds a Serviced Companion Loan, is subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, and the Trustee or any Additional Servicer, Sub-Servicer, or Servicing Function Participant engaged by the Trustee fails to perform (subject to any applicable grace periods set forth therein) any of its obligations under Article XIII of this Agreement, and such failure to perform does not result







 from a failure to perform of any other party to this Agreement to deliver within the time frames required by Article XIII any reports or other information as set forth in such Article to the Trustee, the Trustee shall, if so requested by the Depositor, resign from its obligations hereunder within sixty (60) calendar days of such request and, if the Trustee fails to resign within such sixty (60) day period, the Depositor shall have the right to remove and replace the Trustee in accordance with the provisions set forth in this Section 7.6(b).



 (c)           If at any time (i) the Custodian shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of Section 7.5(b) and shall fail to resign after written request therefor by the Depositor, (ii) the Custodian shall become incapable of acting, or shall be adjudged a bankrupt or insolvent, or a receiver of the Custodian or of its property shall be appointed, or any public officer shall take charge or control of the Custodian or of its property or affairs for the purpose of rehabilitation, conservation or liquidation, (iii) a tax is imposed or threatened with respect to the Trust or any REMIC Pool by any state in which the Custodian or the Trust is located solely because of the location of the Custodian in such state; provided, that, if the Custodian agrees to indemnify the Trust for such taxes, it shall not be removed pursuant to this clause (iii), or (iv) the continuation of the Custodian as such would result in a downgrade, qualification or withdrawal of the rating by the Rating Agencies of any Class of Certificates with a rating as evidenced in writing by the Rating Agencies, then the Depositor may remove such Custodian and appoint a successor custodian by written instrument, one copy of which instrument shall be delivered to the Custodian so removed, one copy to the successor custodian and one copy to each of the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator and the 17g-5 Information Provider.  In the case of removal under clauses (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) above, the Custodian shall bear all such costs of transfer.  Such succession shall take effect after a successor custodian has been appointed.  If the Trust, or any Other Securitization that holds a Serviced Companion Loan, is subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, and the Custodian or any Additional Servicer, Sub-Servicer, or Servicing Function Participant engaged by the Custodian fails to perform (subject to any applicable grace periods set forth therein) any of its obligations under Article XIII of this Agreement, and such default does not result from a failure to perform of any other party to this Agreement to deliver within the time frames required by Article XIII any reports or other information as set forth in such Article to the Custodian, the Custodian shall, if so requested by the Depositor, resign from its obligations hereunder within sixty (60) calendar days of such request and, if the Custodian fails to resign within such sixty (60) day period, the Depositor shall have the right to remove and replace the Custodian in accordance with the provisions set forth in this Section 7.6(c).



 (d)           If at any time (i) the Certificate Administrator shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of Section 7.5(c) and shall fail to resign after written request therefor by the Depositor, (ii) the Certificate Administrator shall become incapable of acting, or shall be adjudged a bankrupt or insolvent, or a receiver of the Certificate Administrator or of its property shall be appointed, or any public officer shall take charge or control of the Certificate Administrator or of its property or affairs for the purpose of rehabilitation, conservation or liquidation, (iii) a tax is imposed or threatened with respect to the Trust or any REMIC Pool by any state in which the Certificate Administrator or the Trust is located solely because of the location of the Certificate Administrator in such state; provided, that, if the Certificate Administrator agrees to indemnify the Trust for such taxes, it shall not be removed pursuant to this clause (iii), or (iv) the continuation of the Certificate Administrator as such would result in a







 downgrade, qualification or withdrawal, as applicable, of the rating by any Rating Agency of any Class of Certificates with a rating as evidenced in writing by the Rating Agencies, then the Depositor or the Trustee shall send a written notice of termination to the Certificate Administrator and the 17g-5 Information Provider (which notice shall specify the reason for such termination) and remove such Certificate Administrator and the Depositor shall appoint a successor Certificate Administrator by written instrument, one copy of which instrument shall be delivered to the Certificate Administrator so removed, one copy to the successor Certificate Administrator, and one copy to each of the Trustee, the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer and the 17g-5 Information Provider.  In all such cases, the Certificate Administrator shall bear all costs of transfer to a successor Certificate Administrator, such succession only to take effect after a successor Certificate Administrator has been appointed.  If the Trust, or any Other Securitization that holds a Serviced Companion Loan, is subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, and the Certificate Administrator or any Additional Servicer, Sub-Servicer, or Servicing Function Participant engaged by the Certificate Administrator fails to perform (subject to any applicable grace periods set forth therein) any of its obligations under Article XIII of this Agreement, and such failure to perform does not result from a default of any other party to this Agreement to deliver within the time frames required by Article XIII any reports or other information as set forth in such Article to the Certificate Administrator, the Certificate Administrator shall, if so requested by the Depositor, resign from its obligations hereunder within sixty (60) calendar days of such request and, if the Certificate Administrator fails to resign within such sixty (60) day period, the Depositor shall have the right to remove and replace the Certificate Administrator in accordance with the provisions set forth in this Section 7.6(d).



 (e)           The Holders of Certificates evidencing not less than a majority of the Voting Rights of all the Certificates may for cause upon thirty (30) days' written notice to the Trustee, the Custodian or the Certificate Administrator, as the case may be, and to the Depositor, the Master Servicer and the Special Servicer, remove the Trustee, the Custodian or the Certificate Administrator, as the case may be, by such written instrument, signed by such Holders or their attorney-in-fact duly authorized, one copy of which instrument shall be delivered to the Depositor and one copy to the Trustee, the Custodian or the Certificate Administrator, as the case may be, so removed; and the Depositor shall thereupon use its best efforts to appoint a successor Trustee, the Custodian or Certificate Administrator, as the case may be, in accordance with this Section.



 (f)           Any resignation or removal of the Trustee, the Custodian or the Certificate Administrator, as the case may be, and appointment of a successor trustee, custodian or certificate administrator pursuant to any of the provisions of this Section shall become effective upon acceptance of appointment by the successor trustee, custodian or certificate administrator, as the case may be, as provided in Section 7.7.  Upon any succession of the Trustee, the Custodian or the Certificate Administrator under this Agreement, the predecessor Trustee, Custodian or Certificate Administrator, as the case may be, shall be entitled to the payment of compensation and reimbursement agreed to under this Agreement for services rendered and expenses incurred.  The Trustee, the Custodian or the Certificate Administrator shall not be liable for any action or omission of any successor trustee, custodian or certificate administrator, as the case may be.







 (g)           Upon the resignation, assignment, merger, consolidation, or transfer of the Trustee or its business to a successor, or upon the removal of the Trustee, the outgoing Trustee at its own expense (without right of reimbursement therefor) shall ensure that, prior to consummation of such transaction or as part of its transfer of duties to any successor or at such later time as may be consented to by the Master Servicer and the Special Servicer, (A) the original executed Note for each Mortgage Loan, is endorsed (without recourse, representation or warranty, express or implied) to the order of the successor, as trustee for the registered holders of Morgan Stanley Bank of America Merrill Lynch Trust 2013-C12, Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2013-C12 or in blank (or, alternatively, if the original executed Note has been lost, a lost note affidavit and indemnity with a copy of such Note), and (B) in the case of the other Mortgage Loan documents, are delivered or assigned as necessary to such successor, and such successor shall review the documents delivered to it or the Custodian with respect to each Mortgage Loan, and certify in writing that, as to each Mortgage Loan then subject to this Agreement, such endorsement and assignment has been made.



 Upon the resignation, assignment, merger, consolidation, or transfer of the Custodian or its business to a successor, or upon the removal of the Custodian, the outgoing Custodian, at its own expense (without right of reimbursement therefor, except in the case of removal without cause), shall ensure that, prior to consummation of such transaction or as part of its transfer of duties to any successor custodian, all Mortgage Loan documents in the Mortgage File for each Mortgage Loan, are delivered as necessary to such successor custodian, and such successor shall review the documents delivered to it with respect to each Mortgage Loan and certify in writing that, as to each Mortgage Loan then subject to this Agreement, it will accept delivery of the Mortgage File (on behalf of the Trustee) in accordance with Section 2.2.



 (h)           Following the Closing Date, for so long as the Trust, and, with respect to any Serviced Companion Loan, the trust created pursuant to an Other Companion Loan Pooling and Servicing Agreement, are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, neither the Certificate Administrator nor the Custodian may appoint any sub-servicer that is or could become a Reporting Servicer without the prior written consent of the Depositor or the depositor with respect to the trust created pursuant to an Other Companion Loan Pooling and Servicing Agreement, as the case may be, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.



 Section 7.7     Successor Trustee, Custodian or Certificate Administrator.



 (a)           Any successor trustee, custodian or certificate administrator appointed as provided in Section 7.6 shall execute, acknowledge and deliver to the Depositor and to its predecessor Trustee, Custodian or Certificate Administrator, as the case may be, an instrument accepting such appointment hereunder, and thereupon the resignation or removal of the predecessor Trustee, Custodian or Certificate Administrator, as the case may be, shall become effective and such successor trustee, custodian or certificate administrator, as the case may be, without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become fully vested with all the rights, powers, duties and obligations of its predecessor hereunder, with like effect as if originally named as Trustee, Custodian or Certificate Administrator herein.  The predecessor Trustee, Certificate Administrator or Custodian shall deliver (at such predecessor's own expense) to the successor trustee, certificate administrator or custodian all Mortgage Files and documents and statements related to the Mortgage Files held by it hereunder, and the predecessor Trustee,

In addition, the Depositor and the predecessor Trustee, Custodian or Certificate Administrator shall execute and deliver such other instruments and do such other things as may reasonably be required to more fully and certainly vest and confirm in the successor trustee, custodian or certificate administrator, as the case may be, all such rights, powers, duties and obligations.  Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, in no event shall the combined fees payable to the Certificate Administrator or a successor certificate administrator (inclusive of fees paid to the Trustee (or successor trustee) and the Custodian (or successor custodian)) exceed the Certificate Administrator Fee.



 (b)           No successor trustee, custodian or certificate administrator shall accept appointment as provided in this Section unless at the time of such appointment such successor trustee, custodian or certificate administrator, as the case may be, shall be eligible under the provisions of Section 7.5.

The separate trustees, co-trustees, or custodians so appointed shall be trustees or custodians for the benefit of all the Certificateholders, shall have such powers, rights and remedies as shall be specified in the instrument of appointment and shall be deemed to have accepted the provisions of this Agreement; provided that no such appointment shall, or shall be deemed to, constitute the appointee an agent of the Trustee; provided, further, that the Trustee shall not be liable for the actions of any co-trustee or separate trustee appointed by it with due care and shall have no liability for the actions of any co-trustee or separate trustee appointed by the Depositor or the Certificateholders pursuant to this paragraph.



 (b)           The Trustee, the Custodian or the Certificate Administrator, as the case may be, may from time to time appoint one or more independent third-party agents to perform all or any portion of its administrative duties hereunder (ixxPDexxPD, collection and distribution of funds, preparation and dissemination of reports, monitoring compliance, etc).  The Trustee, the Custodian or the Certificate Administrator, as the case may be, shall supervise and oversee such agents appointed by it.  The terms of any arrangement or agreement between the Trustee, the Custodian or the Certificate Administrator, as the case may be, and such agent, may be terminated, without cause and without the payment of any termination fees if the Trustee, the Custodian or the Certificate Administrator, as the case may be, is terminated in accordance with this Agreement.  In addition, neither the Trust nor the Certificateholders shall have any liability or direct obligation to such agent.  Notwithstanding the terms of any such agreement, the Trustee, the Custodian or the Certificate Administrator, as the case may be, shall remain at all times obligated and liable to the Trust and the Certificateholders for performing its duties hereunder and for all acts of its agents.







 (c)           Every separate trustee and co-trustee shall, to the extent permitted by law, be appointed and act subject to the following provisions and conditions:



 (i)          all powers, duties, obligations and rights conferred upon the Trustee in respect of the receipt, custody and payment of moneys shall be exercised solely by the Trustee;



 (ii)         all other rights, powers, duties and obligations conferred or imposed upon the Trustee shall be conferred or imposed upon and exercised or performed by the Trustee and such separate trustee or co-trustee jointly, except to the extent that under any law of any jurisdiction in which any particular act or acts are to be performed (whether as Trustee hereunder or as successor to the Master Servicer hereunder) the Trustee shall be incompetent or unqualified to perform such act or acts, in which event such rights, powers, duties and obligations, including the holding of title to the Trust or any portion thereof in any such jurisdiction, shall be exercised and performed by such separate trustee or co-trustee;



 (iii)         no trustee hereunder shall be personally liable by reason of any act or omission of any other trustee hereunder; and



 (iv)        the Trustee or, in the case of the Trust, the Holders of Certificates evidencing not less than a majority of the Voting Rights of all the Certificates may at any time accept the resignation of or remove any separate trustee or co-trustee, so appointed by it or them, if such resignation or removal does not violate the other terms of this Agreement.



 (d)          Any notice, request or other writing given to the Trustee shall be deemed to have been given to each of the then separate trustees and co-trustees, as effectively as if given to each of them.  Every instrument appointing any separate trustee or co-trustee shall refer to this Agreement and the conditions of this Article VII.  Each separate trustee and co-trustee, upon its acceptance of the trusts conferred, shall be vested with the estates or property specified in its instrument of appointment, either jointly with the Trustee or separately, as may be provided therein, subject to all the provisions of this Agreement, specifically including every provision of this Agreement relating to the conduct of, affecting the liability of, or affording protection to, the Trustee.  Every such instrument shall be filed with the Trustee.



 (e)           Any separate trustee or co-trustee may, at any time, constitute the Trustee, its agent or attorney-in-fact with full power and authority, to the extent not prohibited by law, to do any lawful act under or in respect of this Agreement on its behalf and in its name.  If any separate trustee or co-trustee shall die, become incapable of acting, resign or be removed, all of its estates, properties, rights, remedies and trusts shall vest in and be exercised by the Trustee, to the extent permitted by law, without the appointment of a new or successor trustee.



 (f)           No separate trustee or co-trustee hereunder shall be required to meet the terms of eligibility as a successor trustee under Section 7.5 hereof and no notice to Certificateholders of the appointment of any separate trustee or co-trustee hereunder shall be required.



 (g)          The Trustee agrees to instruct the co-trustees, if any, to the extent necessary to fulfill the Trustee's obligations hereunder.

 Section 7.10     Authenticating Agents.

Any successor Authenticating Agent must be acceptable to the Depositor and must be a corporation, national bank or national banking association organized and doing business under the laws of the United States of America or of any state and having a principal office and place of business in the Borough of Manhattan in the City and State of New York, having a combined capital and surplus of at least $50,000,000, authorized under such laws to exercise corporate trust powers and subject to supervision or examination by federal or state authorities.



 (b)           Any Person into which the Authenticating Agent may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any Person resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which the Authenticating Agent shall be a party, or any Person succeeding to the corporate agency business of the Authenticating Agent, shall continue to be the Authenticating Agent without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of the Trustee or the Authenticating Agent.



 (c)           The Authenticating Agent may at any time resign by giving at least thirty (30) days' advance written notice of resignation to the Trustee, the Custodian, the Certificate Administrator and the Depositor.  The Trustee may at any time terminate the agency of the Authenticating Agent by giving written notice of termination to the Authenticating Agent and the Depositor; provided that the Trustee may not terminate the Certificate Administrator as Authenticating Agent unless the Certificate Administrator shall be removed as Certificate Administrator hereunder.  Upon receiving a notice of resignation or upon such a termination, or in case at any time the Authenticating Agent shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of Section 7.10(a), the Trustee may appoint a successor Authenticating Agent, shall give written notice of such appointment to the Depositor and shall mail notice of such appointment to all Holders of Certificates.  Any successor Authenticating Agent upon acceptance of its appointment hereunder shall become vested with all the rights, powers, duties and responsibilities of its predecessor hereunder, with like effect as if originally named as Authenticating Agent.  No such Authenticating Agent shall be appointed unless eligible under the provisions of Section 7.10(a).  No Authenticating Agent shall have responsibility or liability for any action taken by it as such at the direction of the Trustee.



 Section 7.11     Indemnification of Trustee, the Custodian and the Certificate Administrator.



 (a)           The Trustee (whether individually, or in its capacity as Trustee), the Custodian, the Certificate Registrar and the Certificate Administrator and each of their respective directors, officers, employees, agents and Controlling Persons shall be entitled to indemnification from the Trust for any and all claims, losses, penalties, fines, forfeitures, legal fees and related costs, judgments and any other costs, liabilities, fees and expenses incurred in connection with







 any legal action incurred without negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct on their respective part, arising out of, or in connection with this Agreement, the Certificates and the acceptance or administration of the trusts or duties created hereunder (including, without limitation, any unanticipated loss, liability or expense incurred in connection with any action or inaction of the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Trust Advisor or the Depositor or of each other such Person hereunder but only to the extent the Trustee, the Custodian, the Certificate Registrar or the Certificate Administrator, as the case may be, is unable to recover within a reasonable period of time such amount from such third party pursuant to this Agreement) including the costs and expenses of defending themselves against any claim in connection with the exercise or performance of any of their powers or duties hereunder, and the Trustee, the Custodian, the Certificate Registrar and the Certificate Administrator and each of their respective directors, officers, employees, agents and Controlling Persons shall be entitled to indemnification from the Trust for any unanticipated loss, liability or expense incurred without negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct in connection with the provision by the Trustee, the Custodian, the Certificate Registrar and the Certificate Administrator of the reports required to be provided by it pursuant to this Agreement; provided that:



 (i)           with respect to any such claim, the Trustee, the Custodian, the Certificate Registrar or the Certificate Administrator, as the case may be, shall have given the Depositor, the Master Servicer, the Sellers, each other and the Holders of the Certificates written notice thereof promptly after a Responsible Officer of the Trustee, the Custodian, the Certificate Registrar or the Certificate Administrator, as the case may be, shall have actual knowledge thereof; provided that failure to give such notice to the Depositor, Master Servicer, the Sellers, each other and the Holders of Certificates shall not affect the Trustee's, the Custodian's, Certificate Registrar's or Certificate Administrator's, as the case may be, rights to indemnification herein unless the Depositor's defense of such claim on behalf of the Trust is materially prejudiced thereby;



 (ii)          while maintaining control over its own defense, the Trustee, the Custodian, the Certificate Registrar or the Certificate Administrator, as the case may be, shall cooperate and consult fully with the Depositor in preparing such defense; and



 (iii)         notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 7.11, the Trust shall not be liable for settlement of any such claim by the Trustee, the Custodian, the Certificate Registrar or the Certificate Administrator, as the case may be, entered into without the prior consent of the Depositor, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.



 (b)           The provisions of this Section 7.11 shall survive any termination of this Agreement and the resignation or removal of the Trustee, the Custodian, the Certificate Registrar or the Certificate Administrator, as the case may be.



 (c)           The Depositor shall indemnify and hold harmless the Trustee, the Custodian, the Certificate Registrar or the Certificate Administrator, as the case may be, their respective directors, officers, employees or agents and Controlling Persons from and against any loss, claim, damage or liability, and any action in respect thereof, to which the Trustee, the Custodian, the Certificate Registrar or the Certificate Administrator, as the case may be, their respective directors, officers, employees or agents or Controlling Persons may become subject







 under the Securities Act, insofar as such loss, claim, damage, liability or action arises out of, or is based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Private Placement Memorandum, the Preliminary Prospectus or the Final Prospectus, or arises out of, or is based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact necessary to make the statements therein in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and shall reimburse the Trustee, the Custodian, the Certificate Registrar or the Certificate Administrator, as the case may be, their respective directors, officers, employees, agents or Controlling Persons for any legal and other expenses reasonably incurred by the Trustee, the Custodian, the Certificate Registrar or the Certificate Administrator, as the case may be, or any such director, officer, employee, agent or Controlling Person in investigating or defending or preparing to defend against any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; provided, that the Depositor shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action arises out of, or is based upon, any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission made in the Private Placement Memorandum, the Preliminary Prospectus or the Final Prospectus in reliance upon and in conformity with written information concerning the Trustee, the Custodian, the Certificate Registrar or the Certificate Administrator, as the case may be, furnished to the Depositor by or on behalf of such person specifically for inclusion therein.  It is hereby expressly agreed that the only written information provided by the Trustee, the Custodian, the Certificate Registrar or the Certificate Administrator, as the case may be, for inclusion in the Private Placement Memorandum, the Preliminary Prospectus and the Final Prospectus is, in the case of the Trustee, the information for which the Trustee indemnifies certain parties pursuant to the Trustee Indemnification Agreement, in the case of the Custodian, the information for which the Custodian indemnifies certain parties pursuant to the Custodian Indemnification Agreement and, in the case of the Certificate Administrator, the information for which the Certificate Administrator indemnifies certain parties pursuant to the Certificate Administrator Indemnification Agreement.  The Trustee, the Custodian, the Certificate Registrar or the Certificate Administrator, as the case may be, shall immediately notify the Depositor, the Underwriters, the Initial Purchasers and the Sellers if a claim is made by a third party that would entitle such Person, its directors, officers, employees, agents or Controlling Persons to indemnification under this Section 7.11(c), whereupon the Depositor shall assume the defense of any such claim (with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such person) and pay all expenses in connection therewith, including counsel fees, and promptly pay, discharge and satisfy any judgment or decree which may be entered against it or them in respect of such claim.  Any failure to so notify the Depositor shall not affect any rights the Trustee, the Custodian, the Certificate Registrar or the Certificate Administrator, as the case may be, or any of their respective directors, officers, employees, agents or Controlling Persons may have to indemnification under this Section 7.11(c), unless the Depositor's defense of such claim is materially prejudiced thereby.  The indemnification provided herein shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the resignation or removal of the Trustee, the Custodian or the Certificate Administrator.  The Depositor shall not be indemnified by the Trust for any expenses incurred by the Depositor arising from any violation or alleged violation of the Securities Act or Exchange Act by the Depositor.



 (d)           The Custodian agrees to indemnify the Depositor, the Trust, the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator and any director, officer, employee, agent or Controlling Person thereof, and hold them harmless against any and all claims, losses, penalties, fines, forfeitures, legal fees and related costs, judgments, and any other costs, liabilities, fees and expenses that any







 such Person may sustain arising from or as a result of the willful misfeasance, bad faith or negligence in the performance of any of the Custodian's duties hereunder or by reason of negligent disregard of the Custodian's obligations and duties hereunder (including a breach of such obligations a substantial motive of which is to obtain an economic advantage from not complying with or not performing such obligations), and if in any such situation the Custodian is replaced, the parties hereto agree that the amount of such claims, losses, penalties, fines, legal fees and related costs, judgments, and other costs, liabilities, fees and expenses shall at least equal the incremental costs, if any, of retaining a successor custodian.



 (e)           Each of the Trustee and the Certificate Administrator agrees (severally and not jointly) to indemnify the Depositor, the Trust, the Certificate Administrator (in the case of the Trustee), the Trustee (in the case of the Certificate Administrator), the Custodian and any director, officer, employee, agent or Controlling Person thereof, and hold them harmless against any and all claims, losses, penalties, fines, forfeitures, legal fees and related costs, judgments, and any other costs, liabilities, fees and expenses that any such Person may sustain arising from or as a result of the willful misfeasance, bad faith or negligence in the performance of any of such indemnifying party's duties hereunder or by reason of negligent disregard of such indemnifying party's obligations and duties hereunder (including a breach of such obligations a substantial motive of which is to obtain an economic advantage from not complying with or not performing such obligations), and if in any such situation the Trustee or Certificate Administrator, as applicable, is replaced, the parties hereto agree that the amount of such claims, losses, penalties, fines, legal fees and related costs, judgments, and other costs, liabilities, fees and expenses shall at least equal the incremental costs, if any, of retaining a successor trustee or certificate administrator, as applicable.

The Trustee shall be entitled to receive the Trustee Fee, the Certificate Administrator shall be entitled to receive the Certificate Administrator Fee (other than the portions thereof constituting the Trustee Fee and the Custodian Fee) and the Custodian shall be entitled to receive the Custodian Fee, pursuant to Section 5.3(b)(ii) (which shall not be limited by any provision of law with respect to the compensation of a trustee of an express trust), for all services rendered by it in the execution of the trusts hereby created and in the exercise and performance of any of the powers and duties, respectively, hereunder of the Trustee, the Custodian and the Certificate Administrator.  The Trustee, the Custodian and the Certificate Administrator shall also be entitled to recover from the Trust all reasonable unanticipated out-of-pocket expenses and disbursements incurred or made by the Trustee, the Custodian and the Certificate Administrator in accordance with any of the provisions of this Agreement (including the reasonable compensation and the reasonable expenses and disbursements of its counsel and other Persons not regularly in its employ), not including expenses incurred in the ordinary course of performing its duties as Trustee, the Custodian or Certificate Administrator, respectively, hereunder, and except any such expense, disbursement or advance as may arise from the negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith of such Person or which is the responsibility of the Holders of the Certificates hereunder.

If the Trustee, the Custodian or the Certificate Administrator, as the case may be, shall subsequently receive any such amount, it may withdraw such request.

 successor shall agree subject to Section 8.10, provided that no such compensation shall be in excess of that permitted to be paid to the Master Servicer under this Agreement.

The Trustee shall be reimbursed by the Trust for all of its out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with obtaining such successor Master Servicer within thirty (30) days of the Trustee's submission of an invoice with respect thereto, to the extent such expenses have not been reimbursed by the Master Servicer as provided herein; and such expenses paid by the Trust shall be deemed to be an Additional Trust Expense.

As compensation therefor, the Trustee shall be entitled to receive all the compensation payable to the Special Servicer set forth in this Agreement, including, without limitation the Special Servicer Compensation (other than any Workout Fee payable to the predecessor Special Servicer pursuant to Section 9.11).



 (d)           Notwithstanding the above, the Trustee may, if the Trustee shall be unwilling to so act, or shall, if it is unable to so act, appoint, or petition a court of competent jurisdiction to appoint, any established commercial or multifamily mortgage finance institution, special servicer or mortgage servicing institution having a net worth of not less than $15,000,000, and meeting such other standards for a successor Special Servicer as are set forth in Section 9.30(g), and with respect to which the Trustee has provided a Rating Agency

Certain of the provisions of this Article VIII make explicit reference to their applicability to Mortgage Loans, any B Note and any Serviced Companion Loan; notwithstanding such explicit references, references to "Mortgage Loans" contained in this Article VIII, unless otherwise specified, shall be construed to refer also to such B Note and Serviced Companion Loan (but any other terms that are defined in Article I and used in this Article VIII shall be construed according to such definitions without regard to this sentence).



 In connection with such servicing and administration, the Master Servicer shall seek to maximize the timely collection of principal and interest on the Mortgage Notes in the best economic interests of the Certificateholders as a whole (or, in the case of any A/B Whole Loan or Loan Pair the Certificateholders and the holder of the related B Note or Serviced Companion Loan, as applicable, all taken as a collective whole); provided, that nothing herein contained shall be construed as an express or implied guarantee by the Master Servicer of the collectability of payments on the Mortgage Loans or shall be construed as impairing or adversely affecting any rights or benefits specifically provided by this Agreement to the Master Servicer, including with respect to Master Servicing Fees or the right to be reimbursed for Advances.



 (b)           The Master Servicer, in the case of an event specified in clause (x) of this subsection (b), and the Special Servicer, in the case of an event specified in clause (y) of this subsection (b), shall each send a written notice to the other and to the Trustee, the Custodian, the Certificate Administrator, the Controlling Class Representative (during any Subordinate Control Period and any Collective Consultation Period), the Trust Advisor (other than during any Subordinate Control Period), the Depositor, the applicable Seller and, in the case of an A/B

After the transfer of servicing with respect to any Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan to the Special Servicer, in accordance with the Servicing Standard, the Master Servicer shall notify, in writing, the Mortgagor under such Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan transferred to the Special Servicer, of such transfer.



 (c)           With respect to each Mortgage Loan (other than a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan) that is subject to an Environmental Insurance Policy, for as long as it is not a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan, if the Master Servicer has actual knowledge of any event giving rise to a claim under an Environmental Insurance Policy, the Master Servicer shall notify the Special Servicer to such effect and the Master Servicer shall take reasonable actions as are in accordance with the Servicing Standard and the terms and conditions of such Environmental Insurance Policy to make a claim thereunder and achieve the payment of all amounts to which the Trust is entitled thereunder.  Any legal fees or other out-of-pocket costs incurred in accordance with the Servicing Standard in connection with any such claim shall be paid by, and reimbursable to, the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer as a Servicing Advance.



 (d)           In connection with any extension of the Maturity Date of a non-Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan (other than a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan), the Master Servicer shall give prompt written notice of such extension to the insurer under the Environmental Insurance Policy (if any) and shall execute such documents as are reasonably required by such insurer to procure an extension of such policy (if available).



 (e)           The parties hereto acknowledge that each Serviced Pari Passu Mortgage Loan and its related Serviced Companion Loan and each A Note and its related B Note is subject to the terms and conditions of the related Intercreditor Agreement, and each such party agrees that the provisions of each Intercreditor Agreement that are required by their terms to be set forth in this Agreement are hereby incorporated herein.  With respect to each Loan Pair and each A/B Whole Loan, the Trustee, the Master Servicer and the Special Servicer recognize the respective rights and obligations of the Trust and the holders of each Serviced Companion Loan  and B Note, as applicable, under the related Intercreditor Agreement (or with respect to a Joint Mortgage Loan treated as a Loan Pair in accordance with Section 8.30 hereof, the applicable Mortgage Loan documents), including, with respect to the allocation of collections on or in respect of any Serviced Pari Passu Mortgage Loan, Serviced Companion Loan, A Note and B Note, as the case may be, in accordance with the related Intercreditor Agreement.  The Master Servicer shall comply with the applicable provisions of each Intercreditor Agreement, and if any Serviced Pari Passu Mortgage Loan, Serviced Companion Loan, A Note or B Note are then Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans, the Special Servicer shall comply with the applicable







 provisions of the related Intercreditor Agreement.  The parties hereto agree that any conflict between the terms of this Agreement and the terms of any Intercreditor Agreement shall be resolved in favor of the Intercreditor Agreement.



 (f)           Promptly following the Closing Date, the Trustee shall send written notice to each Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan Master Servicer, stating that, as of the Closing Date, the Trustee is the holder of the applicable Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan, and directing such Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan Master Servicer to remit to the Master Servicer all amounts payable to, and directing such Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan Master Servicer to forward, deliver or otherwise make available, as the case may be, to, the Master Servicer all reports, statements, documents, communications and other information that are to be forwarded, delivered or otherwise made available to, such holder of the applicable Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan under the related Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan Pooling and Servicing Agreement and Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan Intercreditor Agreement.



 (g)           Each Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan shall be serviced and administered by the applicable Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan Master Servicer and Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan Special Servicer pursuant to the related Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan Pooling and Servicing Agreement and Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan Intercreditor Agreement, except as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement.  If any Non-Serviced Companion Loan that is an asset under the trust created by the related Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan Pooling and Servicing Agreement is removed from the pool of mortgage loans created under such Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan Pooling and Servicing Agreement, or if such Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan Pooling and Servicing Agreement is otherwise terminated, the servicing of the Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan shall be transferred, pursuant to the related Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan Intercreditor Agreement, and shall be serviced and administered by a successor servicing agreement, which shall have similar provisions to such Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan Pooling and Servicing Agreement to the extent set forth in the related Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan Intercreditor Agreement, and such transfer shall be subject to the delivery by the Master Servicer of a Rating Agency Communication to each Rating Agency.



 Section 8.2     Fidelity Bond and Errors and Omissions Insurance Policy Maintained by the Master Servicer.  The Master Servicer, at its expense, shall maintain in effect a Servicer Fidelity Bond and a Servicer Errors and Omissions Insurance Policy.  The Servicer Errors and Omissions Insurance Policy and Servicer Fidelity Bond shall be issued by a Qualified Insurer (unless the Master Servicer self-insures as provided below) and be in form and amount consistent with the Servicing Standard.  If any such Servicer Errors and Omissions Insurance Policy or Servicer Fidelity Bond ceases to be in effect, then the Master Servicer shall obtain a comparable replacement policy or bond from an insurer or issuer meeting the requirements set forth above as of the date of such replacement.  So long as the long-term rating of the Master Servicer is not less than ''A-'' as rated by Fitch and not less than "A3" as rated by Moody's (or if not rated by Fitch or by Moody's, at least one other NRSRO (which may include S&P and/or DBRS) (or an AxxPDMxxPD Best equivalent)), the Master Servicer may self-insure for the Servicer Fidelity Bond and the Servicer Errors and Omissions Insurance Policy.







 Section 8.3     Master Servicer's General Power and Duties.



 (a)           The Master Servicer shall service and administer the Mortgage Loans and shall, subject to Sections 8.7, 8.18, 8.19, 8.27 and 10.3 and Article XII hereof and as otherwise provided herein and by the Code, have full power and authority to do any and all things which it may deem necessary or desirable in connection with such servicing and administration in accordance with the Servicing Standard (in the case of any A/B Whole Loan and any Loan Pair, subject to the applicable Intercreditor Agreement and, in the case of any Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan, subject to the servicing of such Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan by the applicable Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan Master Servicer and the applicable Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan Special Servicer, as applicable).  To the extent consistent with the foregoing and subject to any express limitations and provisions set forth in this Agreement (and, in the case of any A/B Whole Loan and any Loan Pair, subject to the applicable Intercreditor Agreement and, in the case of any Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan, subject to the servicing of such Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan by the applicable Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan Master Servicer and the applicable Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan Special Servicer, as applicable), including Section 10.3, such power and authority shall include, without limitation, the right, subject to the terms hereof, (A) to execute and deliver, on behalf of the Certificateholders (and in connection with any B Note, the holder of the B Note and, in connection with any Loan Pair, the holder of the Serviced Companion Loan) and the Trustee, customary consents or waivers and other instruments and documents (including, without limitation, estoppel certificates, financing statements, continuation statements, title endorsements and reports and other documents and instruments necessary to preserve and maintain the lien on the related Mortgaged Property and related collateral), (B) to consent to assignments and assumptions or substitutions, and transfers of interest of any Mortgagor, in each case subject to and in accordance with the terms of the related Mortgage Loan and Section 8.7, (C) to collect any Insurance Proceeds, (D) subject to Section 8.7, to consent to any subordinate financings to be secured by any related Mortgaged Property to the extent that such consent is required pursuant to the terms of the related Mortgage or which otherwise is required, and, subject to Section 8.7, to consent to any mezzanine debt to the extent such consent is required pursuant to the terms of the related Mortgage, (E) to consent to the application of any proceeds of insurance policies or condemnation awards to the restoration of the related Mortgaged Property or otherwise and to administer and monitor the application of such proceeds and awards in accordance with the terms of the Mortgage Loan as the Master Servicer deems reasonable under the circumstances, (F) to execute and deliver, on behalf of the Certificateholders (and the holders of any B Note and Serviced Companion Loan) and the Trustee, documents relating to the management, operation, maintenance, repair, leasing and marketing of the related Mortgaged Properties, including agreements and requests by the Mortgagor with respect to modifications of the standards of operation and management of the Mortgaged Properties or the replacement of asset managers, (G) to consent to any operation or action under a Mortgage Loan that is contemplated or permitted under a Mortgage or other documents evidencing or securing the applicable Mortgage Loan (either as a matter of right or upon satisfaction of specified conditions), (H) to obtain, release, waive or modify any term other than a Money Term of a Mortgage Loan and related documents subject to and to the extent permitted by Section 8.18, (I) to exercise all rights, powers and privileges granted or provided to the holder of the Mortgage Notes, any Serviced Companion Loan and any B Note under the terms of the Mortgage, including all rights of consent or approval thereunder, subject to Sections 8.7 and 8.18 of this Agreement, (J) to enter into lease subordination agreements, non-disturbance and attornment







  agreements or other leasing or rental arrangements which may be requested by the Mortgagor or the Mortgagor's tenants, (K) to join the Mortgagor in granting, modifying or releasing any easements, covenants, conditions, restrictions, equitable servitudes, or land use or zoning requirements with respect to the Mortgaged Properties to the extent such does not adversely affect the value of the related Mortgage Loan or Mortgaged Property, (L) to execute and deliver, on behalf of itself, the Trustee, the Trust (and the holders of any B Note and Serviced Companion Loan) or any of them, any and all instruments of satisfaction or cancellation, or of partial or full release or discharge and all other comparable instruments, with respect to the Mortgage Loans and with respect to the Mortgaged Properties, and (M) to hold in accordance with the terms of any Mortgage Loan and this Agreement, Defeasance Collateral.  The foregoing clauses (A) through (M) are referred to collectively as "Master Servicer Consent Matters."  Notwithstanding the above, the Master Servicer shall have no power to (i) waive any Prepayment Premiums, (ii) consent to any modification of a Money Term of a Mortgage Loan or (iii) to exercise such rights or take any of the foregoing actions in violation of Section 10.3 or the terms and conditions of any related Intercreditor Agreement, or otherwise in contravention of the Controlling Class Representative's or any related Loan-Specific Directing Holder's, as applicable, rights to consent to or consult in respect of any such matters pursuant to this Agreement (subject to the Master Servicer's duty to service in accordance with the Servicing Standard).  Nothing contained in this Agreement shall limit the ability of the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer to lend money to (to the extent not secured, in whole or in part, by any Mortgaged Property), accept deposits from and otherwise generally engage in any kind of business or dealings with any Mortgagor as though the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as applicable, was not a party to this Agreement or to the transactions contemplated hereby; provided, that this sentence shall not modify the Servicing Standard.



 (b)           The Master Servicer shall not be obligated to service and administer the Mortgage Loans which have become and continue to be Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans, except as specifically provided herein.  The Master Servicer shall be required to make all calculations and prepare all reports required hereunder with respect to such Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans (other than calculations and reports expressly required to be made by the Special Servicer hereunder) as if no Servicing Transfer Event had occurred and shall continue to collect all Scheduled Payments, make Advances as set forth herein and render such incidental services with respect to such Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans, all as are specifically provided for herein, but shall have no other servicing or other duties with respect to such Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Master Servicer shall not be liable for its failure to make the calculations or prepare the reports required pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence with respect to any Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan if such failure is directly caused by the Special Servicer's failure to provide the Master Servicer with the information that it is required to deliver to the Master Servicer pursuant to Section 9.32(a).  The Master Servicer shall give notice within three (3) Business Days to the Special Servicer of any collections it receives from any Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans, subject to changes agreed upon from time to time by the Special Servicer and the Master Servicer.  The Special Servicer shall instruct the Master Servicer within two (2) Business Days after receiving such notice on how to apply such funds.  The Master Servicer within one (1) Business Day after receiving such instructions shall apply such funds in accordance with the Special Servicer's instructions.  Each Mortgage Loan that becomes a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan shall continue as such until such Mortgage Loan becomes a Rehabilitated Mortgage Loan.  The Master Servicer shall not be







 required to initiate extraordinary collection procedures or legal proceedings with respect to any Mortgage Loan or to undertake any pre-foreclosure procedures.



 (c)           Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, the Trustee shall sign a Power of Attorney substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit O-1 (or such other form as mutually agreed to by the Trustee and the Master Servicer).  From time to time until the termination of the Trust, upon written request from a Servicing Officer for additional powers of attorney from the Trustee to the Master Servicer, the Trustee shall execute and return to the Master Servicer any additional powers of attorney, substantially in the form of Exhibit O-1 (or such other form as mutually agreed to by the Trustee and the Master Servicer) and other documents necessary or appropriate to enable the Master Servicer to service and administer the Mortgage Loans including, without limitation, documents relating to the management, operation, maintenance, repair, leasing or marketing of the Mortgaged Properties.  The Master Servicer shall indemnify the Trustee for any costs, liabilities and expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by the Trustee in connection with the intentional or negligent misuse of such power of attorney by the Master Servicer.  Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the Master Servicer shall not without the Trustee's written consent:  (i) initiate any action, suit or proceeding solely under the Trustee's name without indicating the Master Servicer's representative capacity, or (ii) knowingly take any action that causes the Trustee to be registered to do business in any state, provided that the preceding clause (i) shall not apply to the initiation of actions relating to a Mortgage Loan that the Master Servicer is servicing pursuant to its respective duties herein (in which case the Master Servicer shall give prompt prior notice to the Trustee of the initiation of such action).  The limitations of the preceding clause shall not be construed to limit any duty or obligation imposed on the Trustee under any other provision of this Agreement.



 (d)           The Master Servicer shall make efforts consistent with the Servicing Standard and the terms of this Agreement to collect all payments (including servicing fees, special servicing fees, workout fees and liquidation fees) called for under the terms and provisions of the applicable Mortgage Loans (other than Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans or REO Properties); provided, that with respect to any Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan, such payments shall be collected from the related Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan Master Servicer or Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan Special Servicer, as applicable.



 (e)           The Master Servicer shall segregate and hold all funds collected and received pursuant to any Mortgage Loan (other than any Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan) constituting Escrow Amounts separate and apart from any of its own funds and general assets and shall establish and maintain one or more segregated custodial accounts (each, an "Escrow Account") into which all Escrow Amounts shall be deposited within one (1) Business Day after receipt.  Each Escrow Account shall be an Eligible Account, to the extent permitted under the related Mortgage Loan documents.  The Master Servicer shall also deposit into each Escrow Account any amounts representing losses on Eligible Investments pursuant to the immediately succeeding paragraph and any Insurance Proceeds or Liquidation Proceeds which are required to be applied to the restoration or repair of any Mortgaged Property pursuant to the related Mortgage Loan.  Each Escrow Account shall be maintained in accordance with the requirements of the related Mortgage Loan and in accordance with the Servicing Standard.  Withdrawals from an Escrow Account may be made only for the following purposes (in no order of priority):







 (i)           to effect timely payments of items constituting Escrow Amounts for the related Mortgage Loan;



 (ii)           to transfer funds to the Collection Account (or any sub-account thereof) to reimburse the Master Servicer for any Advance (or the Trust for any Unliquidated Advance) relating to Escrow Amounts, but only from amounts received with respect to the related Mortgage Loan which represent late collections of Escrow Amounts thereunder;



 (iii)          for application to the restoration or repair of the related Mortgaged Property in accordance with the related Mortgage Loan and the Servicing Standard;



 (iv)          to clear and terminate such Escrow Account upon the termination of this Agreement or pay-off of the related Mortgage Loan;



 (v)          to pay from time to time to the related Mortgagor any interest or investment income earned on funds deposited in the Escrow Account if such income is required to be paid to the related Mortgagor under applicable law or by the terms of the related Mortgage Loan, or otherwise to the Master Servicer; and



 (vi)         to remove any funds deposited in an Escrow Account that were not required to be deposited therein or to refund amounts to the Mortgagors determined to be overages.



 Subject to the immediately succeeding sentence, (i) the Master Servicer may direct any depository institution or trust company in which the Escrow Accounts are maintained to invest the funds held therein in one or more Eligible Investments; provided, that such funds shall be either (x) immediately available or (y) available in accordance with a schedule which will permit the Master Servicer to meet the payment obligations for which the Escrow Account was established; (ii) the Master Servicer shall be entitled to all income and gain realized from any such investment of funds as additional servicing compensation; and (iii) the Master Servicer shall deposit from its own funds in the applicable Escrow Account the amount of any loss incurred in respect of any such investment of funds immediately upon the realization of such loss; provided that, unless otherwise set forth in the related Mortgage Loan documents, such investment losses shall not include any loss with respect to such investment which is incurred solely as a result of the insolvency of the federal or state chartered depositary institution or trust company at which such Investment Account is maintained, so long as such depositary institution or trust company (a) satisfied the qualifications set forth in the definition of "Eligible Account" both at the time such investment was made and as of a date not more than thirty (30) days prior to the date of such loss and (b) is not the Person or an Affiliate thereof that made the relevant investment.  The Master Servicer shall not direct the investment of funds held in any Escrow Account and retain the income and gain realized therefrom if the terms of the related Mortgage Loan or applicable law permit the Mortgagor to be entitled to the income and gain realized from the investment of funds deposited therein, and the Master Servicer shall not be required to invest amounts on deposit in Escrow Accounts in Eligible Investments or deposit such amounts in Eligible Accounts to the extent that the Master Servicer is required by either law or under the terms of any related Mortgage Loan to deposit or invest (or the Mortgagor is entitled to direct the







 deposit or investment of) such amounts in another type of investments or accounts.  If the Master Servicer is not entitled to direct the investment of such funds, then:  (1) the Master Servicer shall direct the depository institution or trust company in which such Escrow Accounts are maintained to invest the funds held therein in accordance with the Mortgagor's written investment instructions, if the terms of the related Mortgage Loan or applicable law require the Master Servicer to invest such funds in accordance with the Mortgagor's directions; and (2) in the absence of appropriate written instructions from the Mortgagor, the Master Servicer shall have no obligation to direct the investment of such funds; provided, that if such funds shall be either (y) immediately available or (z) available in accordance with a schedule which will permit the Master Servicer to meet the payment obligations for which the Escrow Account was established, then the Master Servicer shall have no liability for any loss in investments of such funds that are invested pursuant to written instructions from the Mortgagor.



 (f)           The relationship of each of the Master Servicer and the Special Servicer to the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator and the Custodian and to each other under this Agreement is intended by the parties to be that of an independent contractor and not of a joint venturer, partner or agent.



 (g)           With respect to each Mortgage Loan (other than a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan), if required by the terms of the related Mortgage Loan documents, any Lock-Box Agreement or similar agreement, the Master Servicer shall establish and maintain, in accordance with the Servicing Standard, one or more lock-box, cash management or similar accounts ("Lock-Box Accounts") to be held outside the Trust and maintained by the Master Servicer in accordance with the terms of the related Mortgage.  No Lock-Box Account is required to be an Eligible Account, unless otherwise required pursuant to the related Mortgage Loan documents.  The Master Servicer shall apply the funds deposited in such accounts in accordance with terms of the related Mortgage Loan documents, any Lock-Box Agreement and in accordance with the Servicing Standard.



 (h)           The Master Servicer shall process all defeasances of Mortgage Loans (other than any Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan) and Serviced Companion Loans in accordance with the terms of the related Mortgage Loan documents, and shall be entitled to any fees paid relating thereto.  The Master Servicer shall not permit defeasance (or partial defeasance if permitted under the related Mortgage Loan documents) of any Mortgage Loan on or before the second (2nd) anniversary of the Closing Date, or in the case of a Serviced Companion Loan the second (2nd) anniversary of the startup date of any REMIC holding such Serviced Companion Loan, unless such defeasance will not result in an Adverse REMIC Event (or in the case of a Serviced Companion Loan an adverse REMIC event for any REMIC holding such Serviced Companion Loan) and the Master Servicer has received an Opinion of Counsel to such effect (which Opinion of Counsel, to the extent not inconsistent with the related Mortgage Loan documents, shall be paid for by the related Mortgagor) and all items in the following sentence have been satisfied.  Subsequent to the second (2nd) anniversary of the Closing Date, or in the case of a Serviced Companion Loan the second (2nd) anniversary of the startup date of any REMIC holding such Serviced Companion Loan, the Master Servicer, in connection with the defeasance of a Mortgage Loan (other than a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan) or Serviced Companion Loan shall (to the extent it is not inconsistent with the Servicing Standard):  (i) require that the defeasance collateral consists of Government Securities that are acceptable as







 defeasance collateral under the current guidelines of the Rating Agencies, (ii) determine that the defeasance will not result in an Adverse REMIC Event (or in the case of a Serviced Companion Loan an adverse REMIC event for any REMIC holding such Serviced Companion Loan), (iii) either (A) require that the related Mortgagor designate a Single-Purpose Entity to own the Defeasance Collateral (subject to customary qualifications) or (B) establish a Single-Purpose Entity to hold all Defeasance Collateral relating to the Defeasance Loans, (iv) request and receive from the Mortgagor (A) an opinion of counsel that the Trustee will have a perfected, first priority security interest in such Defeasance Collateral and (B) written confirmation from a firm of independent accountants stating that payments made on such Defeasance Collateral in accordance with the terms thereof will be sufficient to pay the subject Mortgage Loan, and if applicable the related Serviced Companion Loan, (or the defeased portion thereof in connection with a partial defeasance) in full on or before its Maturity Date (or, in the case of an ARD Loan, on or before its Anticipated Repayment Date) and to timely pay each subsequent Scheduled Payment and (v) provide a Rating Agency Communication to each Rating Agency.  Any customary and reasonable out-of-pocket expense incurred by the Master Servicer pursuant to this Section 8.3(h) shall be paid by the Mortgagor of the Defeasance Loan pursuant to the related Mortgage, Mortgage Note or other pertinent document, if so allowed by the terms of such documents.  Notwithstanding anything herein or in the related Mortgage Loan documents to the contrary, the Master Servicer may accept as Defeasance Collateral Government Securities that are rated below ''AAA'' (or its equivalent) by any NRSRO notwithstanding any requirements in the related Mortgage Loan documents that require such Defeasance Collateral to be rated ''AAA'' (or its equivalent) by the applicable NRSROs; provided, that, in any case, the Master Servicer has received an Opinion of Counsel that acceptance of such Defeasance Collateral will not cause an Adverse REMIC Event (which Opinion of Counsel, to the extent not inconsistent with the related Mortgage Loan documents, shall be paid for by the related Mortgagor).



 The parties hereto acknowledge that if the payments described in paragraph 32 of Exhibit 2 to the Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreements regarding the obligation of a Mortgagor to pay the reasonable costs and expenses associated with a defeasance of the related Mortgage Loan are insufficient to reimburse the Trust, including, but not limited to, rating agency fees, then the sole obligation of the related Seller shall be to pay an amount equal to such insufficiency or expense to the extent the related Mortgagor is not required to pay such amount.  If any amount is due under the preceding sentence for any Joint Mortgage Loan, then each of the applicable Sellers shall be required to pay only such party's pro rate share.  Promptly upon receipt of notice of such insufficiency or unpaid expense, the Master Servicer shall request the related Seller to make such payment by deposit to the Collection Account.



 In the case of a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan, the Master Servicer shall process any defeasance of such Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan in accordance with the original terms of the respective Mortgage Loan documents.



 Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to the Mortgage Loans originated or acquired by MSMCH and subject to defeasance, MSMCH has retained the right to designate and establish the successor borrower and to purchase or cause the purchase on behalf of the related borrower of the related defeasance collateral ("MSMCH Seller Defeasance Rights and Obligations").  If the Master Servicer receives notice of a defeasance request with respect to a Mortgage Loan originated or acquired by MSMCH and subject to defeasance, the Master







  Servicer shall provide upon receipt of such notice, written notice of such defeasance request to MSMCH or its assignee.  Until such time as MSMCH provides written notice to the contrary, notice of a defeasance of a Mortgage Loan with MSMCH Defeasance Rights and Obligations shall be delivered to MSMCH pursuant to the notice provisions of this Agreement.



 Notwithstanding the foregoing, BANA has retained the right of the lender under the Mortgage Loan documents with respect to the BANA Loans to receive a percentage of the economic benefit associated with the ownership of the successor borrower, and the right to designate and establish the successor borrower and to purchase or cause the purchase on behalf of the related borrower of the related defeasance collateral, if there is a defeasance of a BANA Loan ("BANA Lender Successor Borrower Right").  If the Master Servicer receives notice of a defeasance request with respect to a BANA Loan subject to defeasance, the Master Servicer shall provide upon receipt of such notice, written notice of such defeasance request to BANA or its assignee.  Until such time as BANA provides written notice to the contrary, notice of a defeasance of a BANA Loan with a BANA Lender Successor Borrower Right shall be delivered to BANA pursuant to the notice provisions of this Agreement.  In addition, to the extent that the Master Servicer receives any amount in respect of a BANA Lender Successor Borrower Right that is required to be remitted to BANA pursuant to the related defeasance documents, the Master Servicer shall remit such amounts to BANA pursuant to the terms of the defeasance documents.



 Notwithstanding the foregoing, CIBC has retained the right to establish or designate the successor borrower and to purchase or cause the purchase on behalf of the related borrower of the related defeasance collateral ("CIBC Lender Successor Borrower Right") for all CIBC Loans other than the Mortgage Loan designated as Mortgage Loan No. 15 on the Mortgage Loan Schedule.  If the Master Servicer receives notice of a defeasance request with respect to a CIBC Loan subject to defeasance (other than the Mortgage Loan designated as Mortgage Loan No. 15 on the Mortgage Loan Schedule), the Master Servicer shall provide upon receipt of such notice, written notice of such defeasance request to CIBC or its assignee.  Until such time as CIBC provides written notice to the contrary, notice of a defeasance of a CIBC Loan with CIBC Lender Successor Borrower Right shall be delivered to CIBC pursuant to the notice provisions of this Agreement.



 (i)           The Master Servicer shall, as to each Mortgage Loan (other than a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan) set forth on Schedule V hereto, each of which is secured by the interest of the related Mortgagor under a ground lease, space lease or air rights lease, promptly (and, in any event, within forty-five (45) days) after the Closing Date (or, if later, ten (10) Business Days after its receipt of a copy of the related ground lease, space lease or air rights lease) notify the related lessor of the transfer of such Mortgage Loan to the Trust pursuant to this Agreement and inform such lessor that any notices of default under the related ground lease, space lease or air rights lease should thereafter be forwarded to the Master Servicer.



 (j)           Subject to the rights of the Controlling Class Representative set forth in this Agreement, the Master Servicer shall be entitled (other than with respect to Non-Serviced Mortgage Loans), during any period when (i) the A Note and B Note under any A/B Whole Loan, (ii) the Serviced Pari Passu Mortgage Loan and Serviced Companion Loan under any Loan Pair, and (iii) any Mortgage Loan with any related mezzanine loan, do not constitute







 Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans, to exercise the rights and powers granted under the related Intercreditor Agreement or mezzanine loan intercreditor agreement to the "Note A Holder", the "Note A Controlling Holder", the "Senior Lender", the "Senior Loan Controlling Holder", or such other similar term as may be set forth in any such Intercreditor Agreement or mezzanine loan intercreditor agreement, as applicable, and/or the "Servicer" referred to therein.  For the avoidance of doubt, the parties acknowledge that the Master Servicer shall not be entitled or required to exercise the rights and powers granted to any "Note B Holder" as defined under the related Intercreditor Agreement.



 (k)           Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the Master Servicer's obligations and responsibilities hereunder and the Master Servicer's authority with respect to any Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan are limited by and subject to the terms of the related Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan Intercreditor Agreement and the rights of the applicable Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan Master Servicer and the applicable Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan Special Servicer with respect thereto under the related Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan Pooling and Servicing Agreement.  The Master Servicer shall use reasonable efforts consistent with the Servicing Standard to monitor the servicing of any Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan by the applicable Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan Master Servicer and the applicable Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan Special Servicer pursuant to the related Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan Pooling and Servicing Agreement and shall use reasonable efforts consistent with the Servicing Standard to enforce the rights of the Trustee (as holder of the Non-Serviced Mortgage Loans) under the related Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan Pooling and Servicing Agreement and the related Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan Intercreditor Agreement.  The Master Servicer shall take such actions as it shall deem reasonably necessary to facilitate the servicing of any Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan by the applicable Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan Master Servicer and the applicable Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan Special Servicer including, but not limited to, delivering appropriate Requests for Release to the Custodian in order to deliver any portion of the related Mortgage File to the applicable Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan Master Servicer or applicable Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan Special Servicer under the related Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan Pooling and Servicing Agreement.



 Section 8.4     Sub-Servicing.



 (a)           The Master Servicer shall supervise, administer, monitor, enforce and oversee the servicing of the applicable Mortgage Loans by any Sub-Servicer appointed by it.  Other than with respect to the agreements with any other Sub-Servicer (including the Seller Sub-Servicer) under agreements that are in effect on the Closing Date (each a "Surviving Sub-Servicer"), the terms of any arrangement or agreement between the Master Servicer and a Sub-Servicer shall provide that such agreement or arrangement may be terminated, without cause and without the payment of any termination fees, by the Trustee if such Master Servicer is terminated in accordance with this Agreement.  In addition, none of the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator, the Custodian, the Certificateholders, the holder of any Serviced Companion Loan or the holder of any B Note shall have any direct obligation or liability (including, without limitation, indemnification obligations) with respect to any Sub-Servicer.  The Master Servicer shall be solely responsible for the payment of compensation to any Sub-Servicer appointed by it.  The Master Servicer shall pay the costs of enforcement against any of its Sub-Servicers at its own expense, but shall be reimbursed therefor only (i) from a general recovery resulting from







 such enforcement only to the extent that such recovery exceeds all amounts due in respect of the related Mortgage Loans or (ii) from a specific recovery of costs, expenses or attorney's fees against the party against whom such enforcement is directed.  Notwithstanding the provisions of any primary servicing agreement or sub-servicing agreement, any of the provisions of this Agreement relating to agreements or arrangements between the Master Servicer or a Sub-Servicer, or reference to actions taken through a Sub-Servicer or otherwise, the Master Servicer shall remain obligated and liable to the Trust, the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator, the Custodian, the Special Servicer and the Certificateholders for the servicing and administering of the applicable Mortgage Loans and the Serviced Companion Loans in accordance with (and subject to the limitations contained within) the provisions of this Agreement without diminution of such obligation or liability by virtue of indemnification from a Sub-Servicer and to the same extent and under the same terms and conditions as if the Master Servicer alone were servicing and administering such Mortgage Loans.



 (b)           Subject to the limitations of subsection (a), the Master Servicer may appoint one or more sub-servicers to perform all or any portion of its duties hereunder for the benefit of the Trust, the Trustee and the Certificateholders provided that, after the Closing Date, if and for so long as the Trust or, with respect to any Serviced Companion Loan, the trust created pursuant to an Other Companion Loan Pooling and Servicing Agreement, are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Master Servicer shall not enter into a sub-servicing agreement with any Prohibited Party.



 (c)           Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any sub-servicing agreement with a Sub-Servicer shall provide that (i) the failure of such Sub-Servicer to comply with any of the requirements of Article XIII of this Agreement, (ii) if and for so long as the Trust or, with respect to any Serviced Companion Loan that is deposited into a trust created pursuant to an Other Companion Loan Pooling and Servicing Agreement, such other trust, is subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the failure of such Sub-Servicer to comply with any requirements to deliver any items required by Items 1122 and 1123 of Regulation AB under any other pooling and servicing agreement relating to any commercial mortgage loan securitization or (iii) the status of such Sub-Servicer as a Prohibited Party at any time during which the Trust is subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, shall each constitute an event of default by such Sub-Servicer under such sub-servicing agreement upon the occurrence of which any of the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer or the Depositor shall have the right to immediately terminate such Sub-Servicer and that such termination shall be deemed for cause.



 Section 8.5     Master Servicer May Own Certificates.  The Master Servicer and any agent of the Master Servicer in its individual or any other capacity may become the owner or pledgee of Certificates with the same rights it would have if it were not the Master Servicer or such agent.  Any such interest of the Master Servicer or such agent in the Certificates shall not be taken into account when evaluating whether actions of the Master Servicer are consistent with its obligations in accordance with the Servicing Standard regardless of whether such actions may have the effect of benefiting the Class or Classes of Certificates owned by the Master Servicer.



 Section 8.6     Maintenance of Hazard Insurance, Other Insurance, Taxes and Other.  Subject to the limitations set forth below, the Master Servicer shall use reasonable







 efforts consistent with the Servicing Standard to cause the related Mortgagor to maintain for each Mortgage Loan (other than any REO Mortgage Loans and any Non-Serviced Mortgage Loans) (A) a Standard Hazard Insurance Policy (that, if the terms of the related Mortgage Loan documents and the related Mortgage so require or so permit the holder of such Mortgage Loan to require, contains no exclusion for damages due to any Act or Acts of Terrorism, as defined in the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002) and which does not provide for reduction due to depreciation in an amount that is at least equal to the lesser of (i) the full replacement cost of improvements securing such Mortgage Loan or (ii) the outstanding Unpaid Principal Balance of such Mortgage Loan and any related B Note or Serviced Companion Loan, but, in any event, in an amount sufficient to avoid the application of any co-insurance clause and (B) any other insurance coverage for such Mortgage Loan which the related Mortgagor is required to maintain under the related Mortgage.  If the related Mortgagor does not maintain the insurance set forth in clauses (A) and (B) above, then the Master Servicer shall cause such insurance to be maintained with a Qualified Insurer, provided the Master Servicer shall not be required to maintain earthquake insurance on any Mortgaged Property unless (x) such insurance was required at origination and is available at commercially reasonable rates and (y) the Trustee has an insurable interest.  The Master Servicer shall be deemed to have satisfied its obligations with respect to clause (A) above if the Mortgagor maintains, or the Master Servicer shall have otherwise caused to be obtained, a Standard Hazard Insurance Policy that is in compliance with the related Mortgage Loan documents, and, if required by such Mortgage Loan documents or if such Mortgage Loan documents permit the holder of such Mortgage Loan to require, the Mortgagor pays, or the Master Servicer shall have otherwise caused to be paid, the premium required by the related insurance provider that is necessary to avoid an exclusion in such policy against "acts of terrorism" as defined by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002.



 Each Standard Hazard Insurance Policy maintained with respect to any Mortgaged Property that is not an REO Property shall contain, or have an accompanying endorsement that contains, a standard mortgagee clause.  If the improvements on the Mortgaged Property are located in a designated special flood hazard area by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in the Federal Register, as amended from time to time (to the extent permitted under the related Mortgage Loan documents or as required by law), the Master Servicer (with respect to any Mortgaged Property that is not an REO Property) shall, consistent with the Servicing Standard, cause flood insurance to be maintained.  Such flood insurance shall be in an amount equal to the lesser of (i) the Unpaid Principal Balance of the related Mortgage Loan or (ii) the maximum amount of such insurance available for the related Mortgaged Property under the national flood insurance program, if the area in which the improvements on the Mortgaged Property are located is participating in such program.  Any amounts collected by the Master Servicer under any such policies (other than amounts to be applied to the restoration or repair of the related Mortgaged Property or property thus acquired or amounts released to the Mortgagor in accordance with the terms of the applicable Mortgage Loan documents) shall be deposited in the Collection Account.



 Any cost (such as insurance premiums and insurance broker fees but not internal costs and expenses of obtaining such insurance) incurred by the Master Servicer in maintaining any insurance pursuant to this Section 8.6 shall not, for the purpose of calculating monthly distributions to the Certificateholders or remittances to the Certificate Administrator for their benefit, be added to the principal balance of the related Mortgage Loan, notwithstanding that the







 terms of the related Mortgage Loan documents permit such cost to be added to the outstanding principal balance thereof.  Such costs shall be paid as a Servicing Advance by the Master Servicer, subject to Section 4.4 hereof.



 Notwithstanding the above, the Master Servicer shall have no obligation beyond using its reasonable efforts consistent with the Servicing Standard to enforce such insurance requirements.  Furthermore, the Master Servicer shall not be required in any event to cause the Mortgagor to maintain or itself obtain insurance coverage (i) beyond what is available on commercially reasonable terms at a cost customarily acceptable (in each case, as determined by the Master Servicer, which shall be entitled to rely, at its sole expense, on insurance consultants in making such determination, consistent with the Servicing Standard) and consistent with the Servicing Standard or (ii) in the case of the Master Servicer obtaining such insurance, if the Trustee does not have an insurable interest; provided that the Master Servicer shall be obligated to cause the Mortgagor to maintain or itself obtain insurance against property damage resulting from terrorism or similar acts if the terms of the related Mortgage Loan documents and the related Mortgage so require unless the Special Servicer determines, subject to Section 10.3 and the terms and conditions of any related Intercreditor Agreement, that the failure to maintain such insurance would constitute an Acceptable Insurance Default (based on information and documents provided by the Master Servicer as reasonably requested by the Special Servicer).  The Master Servicer shall notify the holder of the related Serviced Companion Loan of any determination that it makes pursuant to the proviso to the prior sentence with respect to any Serviced Pari Passu Mortgage Loan.



 The Master Servicer shall conclusively be deemed to have satisfied its obligations as set forth in this Section 8.6 either (i) if the Master Servicer shall have obtained and maintained a master force placed or blanket insurance policy insuring against hazard losses on all of the applicable Mortgage Loans (other than a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan), any Serviced Companion Loan and any B Note serviced by it, it being understood and agreed that such policy may contain a deductible clause on terms substantially equivalent to those commercially available and maintained by comparable servicers consistent with the Servicing Standard, and provided that such policy is issued by a Qualified Insurer or (ii) if the Master Servicer, for so long as its long-term rating is not less than ''A-'' as rated by Fitch and not less than "A3" as rated by Moody's (or if not rated by Fitch or by Moody's, an equivalent rating such as those listed above by at least one other NRSRO (which may include S&P and/or DBRS) (or an AxxPDMxxPD Best equivalent)), self-insures for its obligations as set forth in the first paragraph of this Section 8.6.  If the Master Servicer shall cause any Mortgage Loan to be covered by such a master force placed or blanket insurance policy, the incremental cost of such insurance allocable to such Mortgage Loan (ixxPDexxPD, other than any minimum or standby premium payable for such policy whether or not any Mortgage Loan is then covered thereby), if not borne by the related Mortgagor, shall be paid by the Master Servicer as a Servicing Advance.  If such policy contains a deductible clause, the Master Servicer shall, if there shall not have been maintained on the related Mortgaged Property a policy complying with this Section 8.6 and there shall have been a loss that would have been covered by such policy, deposit in the Collection Account the amount not otherwise payable under such master force placed or blanket insurance policy because of such deductible clause to the extent that such deductible exceeds (i) the deductible under the related Mortgage Loan or (ii) if there is no deductible limitation required under such Mortgage Loan, the deductible amount with respect to insurance policies generally available on properties







 similar to the related Mortgaged Property which is consistent with the Servicing Standard, and deliver to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate describing the calculation of such amount.  In connection with its activities as administrator and servicer of the Mortgage Loans, any Serviced Companion Loan and any B Note, the Master Servicer agrees to present, on its behalf and on behalf of the Trustee and the holders of any Serviced Companion Loan or any B Note, claims under any such master force placed or blanket insurance policy.



 With respect to each Mortgage Loan (other than any Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan), the Master Servicer shall maintain accurate records with respect to each related Mortgaged Property reflecting the status of taxes, assessments and other similar items that are or may become a lien on the related Mortgaged Property and the status of insurance premiums payable with respect thereto.  From time to time, the Master Servicer (other than with respect to REO Mortgage Loans and Non-Serviced Mortgage Loans) shall (i) obtain all bills for the payment of such items (including renewal premiums), and (ii) except in the case of Mortgage Loans under which Escrow Amounts are not held by the Master Servicer, effect payment of all such bills, taxes and other assessments with respect to such Mortgaged Properties prior to the applicable penalty or termination date, in each case employing for such purpose Escrow Amounts as allowed under the terms of the related Mortgage Loan.  If a Mortgagor fails to make any such payment on a timely basis or collections from the Mortgagor are insufficient to pay any such item before the applicable penalty or termination date, the Master Servicer in accordance with the Servicing Standard shall use its reasonable efforts to pay as a Servicing Advance the amount necessary to effect the payment of any such item prior to such penalty or termination date, subject to Section 4.4 hereof.  No costs incurred by the Master Servicer or the Trustee as the case may be, in effecting the payment of taxes and assessments on the Mortgaged Properties and related insurance premiums and ground rents shall, for the purpose of calculating distributions to Certificateholders, be added to the principal balance of the Mortgage Loans, notwithstanding that the terms of such Mortgage Loans permit such costs to be added to the outstanding principal balances of such Mortgage Loans.



 Section 8.7     Enforcement of Due-on-Sale Clauses; Assumption Agreements; Due-on-Encumbrance Clause.



 (a)           If the Master Servicer receives a request from a Mortgagor (or other obligor) pursuant to the provisions of any Mortgage Loan, Serviced Companion Loan or B Note (other than a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan or a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan) that expressly permits, subject to any conditions set forth in the related Mortgage Loan documents, the assignment of the related Mortgaged Property to, and assumption of such Mortgage Loan, Serviced Companion Loan or B Note by, another Person, then the Master Servicer shall obtain relevant information for purposes of evaluating such request.  For the purpose of the foregoing sentence, the term 'expressly permits' shall include outright permission to assign, permission to assign upon satisfaction of certain conditions or prohibition against assignment except upon the satisfaction of stated conditions, in each case without lender discretion.  In addition, if any Mortgage Loan that is not a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan or a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan contains a provision in the nature of a "due-on-sale" clause, which by its terms (i) provides that such Mortgage Loan shall (or may at the mortgagee's option) become due and payable upon the sale or other transfer of an interest in the related Mortgaged Property or ownership interest in the related Mortgagor, or (ii) provides that such Mortgage Loan may not be assumed, or







 ownership interests in the related Mortgagor may not be transferred, without the consent of the related mortgagee in connection with any such sale or other transfer, then, upon the request of the related Mortgagor or other appropriate party or a potential or actual breach of such "due-on-sale" clause, the Master Servicer shall review whether to recommend to the Special Servicer to waive the effect of such provision.  In connection with the foregoing, and subject to Section 10.3 and the terms and conditions of any related Intercreditor Agreement, the Master Servicer shall provide to the Special Servicer (and solely with respect to any A/B Whole Loan, the holder of the B Note, and if required by the related Intercreditor Agreement, the holder of the Serviced Companion Loan) a written recommendation as to whether such assignment and assumption should be approved or such due-on-sale clause should be waived, as the case may be, together with the materials and written analysis upon which such recommendation is based and any information in the possession of the Master Servicer that is reasonably necessary to make a decision with respect to such recommendation, and (A) subject to Section 10.3 and the terms and conditions of any related Intercreditor Agreement, the Special Servicer shall, in accordance with the Servicing Standard, grant or withhold consent to any such request for such assignment and assumption in accordance with the terms of the related Mortgage Loan, Serviced Companion Loan or B Note and this Agreement, or to any such waiver of a due-on-sale clause, such consent of the Special Servicer to be deemed given if not denied within the period contemplated by Section 10.3, and (B) the Master Servicer shall act accordingly and shall not permit any such assignment or assumption or waive any such due-on-sale clause unless (i) it has received the written consent of the Special Servicer or such consent has been deemed to have been granted as set forth in this sentence and (ii) with respect to any A/B Whole Loan or Loan Pair, the Master Servicer has obtained the approval of the holder of the related B Note or Serviced Companion Loan, as applicable, to the extent provided for in the related Intercreditor Agreement, and in accordance with any procedures therefor set forth in Section 10.13.  If the Special Servicer withholds consent pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement, it shall provide the Master Servicer with a written statement and a verbal explanation, as necessary, as to its reasoning and analysis.



 Upon consent or deemed consent by the Special Servicer (subject to Section 10.3 and the terms and conditions of any related Intercreditor Agreement) to any proposed assignment and assumption, the Master Servicer shall process such request of the related Mortgagor (or other obligor) and shall be authorized to enter into an assignment and assumption or substitution agreement with the Person to whom the related Mortgaged Property has been or is proposed to be conveyed, and/or release the original Mortgagor from liability under the related Mortgage Loan, Serviced Companion Loan or B Note and substitute as obligor thereunder the Person to whom the related Mortgaged Property has been or is proposed to be conveyed; provided that the Master Servicer shall not enter into any such agreement to the extent that any terms thereof would result in an Adverse REMIC Event or create any lien on a Mortgaged Property that is senior to, or on parity with, the lien of the related Mortgage.  To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Master Servicer shall not enter into such an assumption or substitution agreement unless the credit status of the prospective new Mortgagor (or other obligor) is in conformity to the terms of the related Mortgage Loan and, if applicable, B Note or Serviced Companion Loan documents.  In making its recommendation to the Special Servicer, the Master Servicer shall evaluate such conformity in accordance with the Servicing Standard.







 Neither the Master Servicer nor the Special Servicer shall have any liability, and each of them shall be indemnified by the Trust for any liability to the Mortgagor or the proposed assignee, for any delay in responding to requests for assumption, if the same shall occur as a result of the failure of any Rating Agency to respond to such request in a reasonable period of time.



 (b)           Prior to consenting to any assignment and assumption or waiver of a "due-on-sale" clause pursuant to Section 8.7(a) with respect to any Mortgage Loan, the Master Servicer shall provide a Rating Agency Communication to each Rating Agency, the 17g-5 Information Provider and each Other NRSRO with respect to any securities that are rated by any such NRSRO and evidence direct beneficial interests in a Serviced Companion Loan or B Note regarding such assignment and assumption or waiver if (A) the Unpaid Principal Balance of such Mortgage Loan at such time equals or exceeds 5% of the Aggregate Certificate Balance of the Principal Balance Certificates or exceeds $35,000,000 or (B) such Mortgage Loan is one of the then current ten (10) largest Mortgage Loans or groups of Crossed Mortgage Loans (by Unpaid Principal Balance) in the Trust Fund; provided, that no Rating Agency Communication will be required under such circumstances if the Unpaid Principal Balance of such Mortgage Loan is less than $5,000,000.  In connection with each such Rating Agency Communication, the Master Servicer shall prepare and, subject to Section 5.7, deliver to the Rating Agencies a memorandum outlining its analysis and recommendation in accordance with the Servicing Standard, together with copies of all relevant documentation and the Master Servicer shall promptly forward copies of the assignment and assumption documents relating to such Mortgage Loan to the Special Servicer, the Certificate Administrator, the Custodian, the 17g-5 Information Provider and the Trustee, and the Master Servicer shall promptly thereafter, subject to Section 5.7, forward such documents to the Rating Agencies.



 (c)           The Master Servicer for the benefit of the Certificateholders, the holder of any related Serviced Companion Loan and the holder of any related B Note shall execute any necessary instruments (pursuant to subsection (a)) for such assignment and assumption agreements.  Upon the closing of the transactions contemplated by such documents, the Master Servicer shall cause the originals of the assignment and assumption agreement, the release (if any), or the modification or supplement to the related Mortgage Loan to be delivered to the Custodian except to the extent such documents have been submitted to the recording office, in which event the Master Servicer shall promptly deliver copies of such documents to the Custodian and the Special Servicer.



 (d)           If any Mortgage Loan (other than a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan or a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan) which contains a provision in the nature of a "due-on-encumbrance" clause, which by its terms:



 (i)           provides that such Mortgage Loan shall (or may at the mortgagee's option) become due and payable upon the creation of any additional lien or other encumbrance on the related Mortgaged Property or a lien on an ownership interest in the Mortgagor; or



 (ii)          requires the consent of the Mortgagee to the creation of any such additional lien or other encumbrance on the related Mortgaged Property or a lien on an ownership interest in the Mortgagor,







 then, if the Master Servicer receives a request for a waiver of, or gains actual knowledge of any potential or actual breach of, such "due-on-encumbrance" clause, the Master Servicer shall obtain relevant information for purposes of evaluating whether to recommend to the Special Servicer to enforce or waive such due-on-encumbrance clause.  The Master Servicer shall then, subject to Section 10.3 and the terms and conditions of any related Intercreditor Agreement, provide to the Special Servicer a written recommendation as to whether such due-on-encumbrance clause should be waived, together with the materials and an analysis upon which such recommendation is based, and any information in the possession of the Master Servicer that is reasonably necessary to make a decision with respect to such recommendation, and (A) subject to Section 10.3 and the terms and conditions of any related Intercreditor Agreement, the Special Servicer shall, in accordance with the Servicing Standard, grant or withhold consent to any waiver of such due-on-encumbrance clause, such consent of the Special Servicer to be deemed given if not denied within the time period contemplated by Section 10.3, and (B) the Master Servicer shall act accordingly and shall not permit any such waiver unless it has received the written consent of the Special Servicer or such consent has been deemed to have been granted as set forth in this sentence.  If the Special Servicer withholds consent pursuant to the foregoing provisions, it shall provide the Master Servicer with a written statement and a verbal explanation, as necessary, as to its reasoning and analysis.  Upon consent or deemed consent by the Special Servicer to such proposed waiver, the Master Servicer shall process such request of the related Mortgagor subject to the other requirements set forth above.



 (e)           Prior to consenting to any waiver of a "due-on-encumbrance" clause pursuant to Section 8.7(d) with respect to any Mortgage Loan, the Master Servicer shall provide a Rating Agency Communication regarding such waiver to each Rating Agency and the 17g-5 Information Provider with respect to any securities that are rated by any such NRSRO and evidence direct beneficial interests in a Serviced Companion Loan or a B Note.



 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 8.7 that requires the consent of the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as applicable, any such consent with respect to any A/B Whole Loan or any Loan Pair shall be obtained in accordance with the related Intercreditor Agreement and within the time periods specified therein.



 Section 8.8     Custodian to Cooperate; Release of Trust Mortgage Files.  Upon the payment in full of any Mortgage Loan, the complete defeasance of a Mortgage Loan, satisfaction or discharge in full of any Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan, the purchase of an A Note by the holder of a B Note pursuant to the related Intercreditor Agreement, or the receipt by the Master Servicer of a notification that payment in full (or such payment, if any, in connection with the satisfaction and discharge in full of any Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan) will be escrowed in a manner customary for such purposes, and upon notification by the Master Servicer in the form of a certification (which certification shall include a statement to the effect that all amounts received or to be received in connection with such payment which are required to be deposited in the Collection Account have been or will be so deposited) of a Servicing Officer and a request for release of the Trust Mortgage File in the form of Exhibit C hereto delivered to the Custodian (on the Trustee's behalf), the Custodian (on the Trustee's behalf) shall promptly release the related Trust Mortgage File to the Master Servicer, and the Custodian (on the Trustee's behalf) shall deliver to the Master Servicer the deed of reconveyance or release, satisfaction or assignment of mortgage or such instrument releasing the lien of the Mortgage, as







 directed by the Master Servicer together with the Mortgage Note with written evidence of cancellation thereon.  The provisions of the immediately preceding sentence shall not, in any manner, limit or impair the right of the Master Servicer to execute and deliver, on behalf of the Trustee, the Certificateholders, the holder of any Serviced Companion Loan, the holder of any B Note or any of them, any and all instruments of satisfaction, cancellation or assignment without recourse, representation or warranty, or of partial or full release or discharge and all other comparable instruments, with respect to the Mortgage Loans, any Serviced Companion Loan or any B Note, and with respect to the Mortgaged Properties held for the benefit of the Certificateholders, the holder of any Serviced Companion Loan and the holder of any B Note.  No expenses incurred in connection with any instrument of satisfaction or deed of reconveyance shall be chargeable to the Distribution Account but shall be paid by the Master Servicer except to the extent that such expenses are paid by the related Mortgagor in a manner consistent with the terms of the related Mortgage and applicable law.  From time to time and as shall be appropriate for the servicing of any Mortgage Loan, including for such purpose, collection under any policy of flood insurance, any Servicer Fidelity Bond or Errors and Omissions Policy, or for the purposes of effecting a partial or total release of any Mortgaged Property from the lien of the Mortgage or the making of any corrections to the Mortgage Note or the Mortgage or any of the other documents included in the Trust Mortgage File, the Custodian shall, upon request of the Master Servicer and the delivery to the Custodian of a Request for Release signed by a Servicing Officer, in the form of Exhibit C hereto, release the Trust Mortgage File to the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as the case may be.



 Section 8.9     Documents, Records and Funds in Possession of Master Servicer to be Held for the Trustee for the Benefit of the Certificateholders.  Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, the Master Servicer shall transmit to the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator and the Custodian, to the extent required by this Agreement, all documents and instruments coming into the possession of the Master Servicer from time to time and shall account fully to the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator and the Custodian for any funds received or otherwise collected thereby, including Liquidation Proceeds or Insurance Proceeds in respect of any Mortgage Loan.  All Servicer Mortgage Files and funds collected or held by, or under the control of, the Master Servicer in respect of any Mortgage Loans (or any B Note or Serviced Companion Loan), whether from the collection of principal and interest payments or from Liquidation Proceeds or Insurance Proceeds, including any funds on deposit in the Collection Account (or any A/B Whole Loan Custodial Account or any Serviced Companion Loan Custodial Account), shall be held by the Master Servicer for and on behalf of the Trustee and the Certificateholders (or the holder of any B Note or Serviced Companion Loan, as applicable) and shall be and remain the sole and exclusive property of the Trust, subject to the applicable provisions of this Agreement.  The Master Servicer agrees that it shall not create, incur or subject any Servicer Mortgage Files or Trust Mortgage File or any funds that are deposited in the Collection Account or any Escrow Account, or any funds that otherwise are or may become due or payable to the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator or the Custodian, to any claim, lien, security interest, judgment, levy, writ of attachment or other encumbrance, or assert by legal action or otherwise any claim or right of setoff against any Servicer Mortgage Files or Trust Mortgage File or any funds collected on, or in connection with, a Mortgage Loan, except, however, that the Master Servicer shall be entitled to receive from any such funds any amounts that are properly due and payable to the Master Servicer under this Agreement.







 Section 8.10     Servicing Compensation.



 (a)           As compensation for its activities hereunder, the Master Servicer shall be entitled to the Master Servicing Fee, which shall be payable by the Trust from amounts held in the Collection Account (and from the related A/B Whole Loan Custodial Account to the extent related solely to a B Note and from the related Serviced Companion Loan Custodial Account to the extent related solely to a Serviced Companion Loan) or otherwise collected from the Mortgage Loans and, if applicable, A/B Whole Loans and Loan Pairs (including a Mortgage Loan, A/B Whole Loan or Loan Pair that relates to an REO Property or is a Defeasance Loan), including any Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan, as provided in Section 5.2.  The Master Servicer's rights to the Master Servicing Fee may not be transferred in whole or in part except in connection with the transfer of all of the Master Servicer's responsibilities and obligations under this Agreement or as provided in the following paragraph with respect to the Excess Servicing Fee.



 The Master Servicer and any successor holder of the Excess Servicing Fee Rights shall be entitled, at any time, at its own expense, to transfer, sell, pledge or otherwise assign such Excess Servicing Fee Rights in whole (but not in part), in either case, to any Qualified Institutional Buyer or Institutional Accredited Investor (other than a Plan); provided, that no such transfer, sale, pledge or other assignment shall be made unless (i) that transfer, sale, pledge or other assignment is exempt from the registration and/or qualification requirements of the Securities Act and any applicable state securities laws and is otherwise made in accordance with the Securities Act and such state securities laws, (ii) the prospective transferor shall have delivered to the Depositor a certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit S-1 attached hereto, and (iii) the prospective transferee shall have delivered to the Master Servicer and the Depositor a certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit S-2 attached hereto.  None of the Depositor, the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator, the Custodian, the Trust Advisor or the Certificate Registrar shall have any obligation to register or qualify an Excess Servicing Fee Right under the Securities Act or any other securities law or to take any action not otherwise required under this Agreement to permit the transfer, sale, pledge or assignment of an Excess Servicing Fee Right without registration or qualification.  The Master Servicer and each holder of an Excess Servicing Fee Right desiring to effect a transfer, sale, pledge or other assignment of such Excess Servicing Fee Right shall, and the Master Servicer hereby agrees, and each such holder of an Excess Servicing Fee Right by its acceptance of such Excess Servicing Fee Right shall be deemed to have agreed, in connection with any transfer of such Excess Servicing Fee Right effected by such Person, to indemnify the Certificateholders, the Trust, the Depositor, the Underwriters, the Initial Purchasers, the Certificate Administrator, the Custodian, the Trustee, the Master Servicer, the Certificate Registrar, the Trust Advisor and the Special Servicer against any liability that may result if such transfer is not exempt from registration and/or qualification under the Securities Act or other applicable federal and state securities laws or is not made in accordance with such federal and state laws or in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this paragraph.  By its acceptance of an Excess Servicing Fee Right, the holder thereof shall be deemed to have agreed not to use or disclose such information in any manner that could result in a violation of any provision of the Securities Act or other applicable securities laws or that would require registration of such Excess Servicing Fee Right or any Certificate pursuant to the Securities Act.  From time to time following any transfer, sale, pledge or assignment of an Excess Servicing Fee Right, the Master Servicer with respect to the related Mortgage Loan,







 Serviced Companion Loan or successor REO Loan with respect thereto to which the Excess Servicing Fee Right relates, shall pay, out of the Master Servicing Fee paid to the Master Servicer with respect to such Mortgage Loan, Serviced Companion Loan or REO Loan, as the case may be, the related Excess Servicing Fee to the holder of such Excess Servicing Fee Right within one Business Day following the payment of such Master Servicing Fee to the Master Servicer, in each case in accordance with payment instructions provided by such holder in writing to the Master Servicer.  The holder of an Excess Servicing Fee Right shall not have any rights under this Agreement except as set forth in the preceding sentences of this paragraph.  None of the Certificate Administrator, the Custodian, the Certificate Registrar, the Trust Advisor, the Depositor, the Special Servicer or the Trustee shall have any obligation whatsoever regarding payment of the Excess Servicing Fee or the assignment or transfer of the Excess Servicing Fee Right.



 (b)           Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary (and, in the case of any A/B Whole Loan, Loan Pair or Non-Serviced Loan Combination, subject to any provisions of the applicable Intercreditor Agreement relating to the allocation of the amounts set forth below), the Master Servicer shall be entitled to receive the following items as additional servicing compensation:

 (a)           (i)           Subject to Section 10.3 and the terms and conditions of any related Intercreditor Agreement, the Master Servicer in accordance with the Servicing Standard may agree to any modification, waiver, amendment or consent of or relating to any term (other than a Money Term) of a Mortgage Loan (other than a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan), a Serviced Companion Loan or a B Note that is not a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan (such terms to include, without limitation, Master Servicer Consent Matters set forth in Section 8.3(a) hereof), provided that such amendment would not result in an Adverse REMIC Event or an Adverse Grantor Trust Event.

 (ii)          Subject to Section 10.3 and the terms and conditions of any related Intercreditor Agreement, the Master Servicer may extend the maturity date of any Balloon Mortgage Loan (other than a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan) that is not a Specially Serviced







 Mortgage Loan to a date that is not more than sixty (60) days following the original Maturity Date, if in the Master Servicer's sole judgment exercised in good faith (and evidenced by an Officer's Certificate delivered to the Special Servicer and the Trustee), a default in the payment of the Balloon Payment is reasonably foreseeable and such extension is reasonably likely to produce a greater recovery to the Holders and the holders of the related B Note and Serviced Companion Loan (as a collective whole) on a net present value basis (calculated in accordance with Section 1.2(e)) than liquidation of such Mortgage Loan and the Mortgagor has obtained an executed written commitment (subject only to satisfaction of conditions set forth therein) for refinancing of such Mortgage Loan or purchase of the related Mortgaged Property. The Master Servicer shall process all such extensions.



 (b)           The Master Servicer may require, in its discretion (unless prohibited or otherwise provided in the Mortgage Loan documents), as a condition to granting any request by a Mortgagor for any consent, modification, waiver, amendment or collateral release, that such Mortgagor pay to the Trust a reasonable and customary modification fee to the extent permitted by law; provided that the collection of such fee shall not be permitted if collection of such fee would cause a "significant modification" (within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.860G-2(b)) of the Mortgage Loan.  The Master Servicer may charge the Mortgagor for any costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees and rating agency fees) incurred by the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer (and any amounts incurred by the Special Servicer shall be reimbursed to the Special Servicer as an Additional Trust Expense) in connection with any request for a modification, waiver, amendment or collateral release.  The Master Servicer agrees to use its reasonable best efforts in accordance with the Servicing Standard to collect such costs, expenses and fees from the Mortgagor and if the Master Servicer believes that the costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees) to be incurred by the Master Servicer in connection with any request for a modification, waiver or amendment will result in a payment or reimbursement by the Trust, then the Master Servicer shall notify the Special Servicer prior to incurring any such costs and expenses, provided that the failure or inability of the Mortgagor to pay any such costs and expenses shall not impair the right of the Master Servicer to cause such costs and expenses (but not including any modification fee), and interest thereon at the Advance Rate, to be paid or reimbursed by the Trust as a Servicing Advance (to the extent not paid by the Mortgagor).



 (c)           The Master Servicer shall notify the Trustee, the Custodian, the Certificate Administrator, the 17g-5 Information Provider, the Controlling Class Representative (during any Subordinate Control Period and any Collective Consultation Period), the Trust Advisor (other than during any Subordinate Control Period) and the Special Servicer of any modification, waiver or amendment of any term of any Mortgage Loan permitted by it under this Section and the date thereof, and shall deliver to the Custodian (on the Trustee's behalf) for deposit in the related Mortgage File, an original counterpart of the agreement relating to such modification, waiver or amendment, promptly following the execution thereof except to the extent such documents have been submitted to the applicable recording office, in which event the Master Servicer shall promptly deliver copies of such documents to the Custodian (on the Trustee's behalf).  The Master Servicer shall not agree to any modification, waiver, or amendment of any term of a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan or a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan.  The Master Servicer shall notify the holder of the B Note and the Serviced Companion Loan of any modification of the monthly payments of an A/B Whole Loan or a Loan Pair, as the case may be, and such monthly payments shall be allocated in accordance with the related Intercreditor

 (iii)         the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Master Servicer, the consummation by the Master Servicer of the transactions contemplated hereby, and the fulfillment of or compliance by the Master Servicer with the terms and conditions of this Agreement will not (1) conflict with, result in a breach, violation or acceleration of, or result in a default under, the terms of any other material agreement or instrument to which it is a party or by which it may be bound, or any law, governmental rule, regulation, or judgment, decree or order applicable to it of any court, regulatory body, administrative agency or governmental body having jurisdiction over it, in any manner that materially and adversely affects its ability to perform its obligations under this Agreement or (2) result in a breach of any term or provision of its organizational documents;



 (iv)        no litigation is pending or, to the best of the Master Servicer's knowledge, threatened, against it, the outcome of which, in the Master Servicer's reasonable judgment, could reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect the execution, delivery or enforceability of this Agreement or its ability to service the Mortgage Loans it is required to service hereunder or to perform any of its other obligations hereunder in accordance with the terms hereof;



 (v)          no consent, approval, authorization or order of any court or governmental agency or body is required for the execution, delivery and performance by it of, or compliance by it with, this Agreement, or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, or if any such consent, approval, authorization or order is required, it has obtained the same or will obtain the same prior to the time necessary to perform its obligations under this Agreement, and, except to the extent in the case of performance, that its failure to be qualified to do business or licensed in one or more states does not materially and adversely affect the performance by it of its obligations hereunder; and

 (c)           Any cause of action against the Master Servicer arising out of the breach of any representations and warranties made in this Section shall accrue upon the giving of written notice to the Master Servicer by any of the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator or the Custodian.  The Master Servicer shall give prompt notice to the Trustee, the Custodian, the Depositor and the Special Servicer of the occurrence, or the failure to occur, of any event that, with notice or the passage of time or both, would cause any representation or warranty in this Section to be untrue or inaccurate in any respect.



 Section 8.21     Merger or Consolidation.  Any Person into which the Master Servicer may be merged or consolidated, or any Person resulting from any merger, conversion, consolidation or other change in form to which the Master Servicer shall be a party (but not the surviving entity), or any Person succeeding to the business of the Master Servicer, shall be the successor of the Master Servicer hereunder, without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of any of the parties hereto, provided that the Master Servicer shall have provided a Rating Agency Communication to each Rating Agency and each other NRSRO with respect to any securities rated by any such NRSRO evidencing direct beneficial ownership interests in any Serviced Companion Loan or B Note.  If a transaction described in the preceding sentence occurs and (i) the conditions to the provisions in such sentence are not met, then the Trustee may terminate or (ii) the conditions set forth in the following paragraph are not met, the Trustee shall terminate, the successor's, survivor's or resulting entity's servicing of the Mortgage Loans pursuant hereto, such termination to be effected in the manner set forth in Sections 8.28 and 8.29.  The successor or surviving Person shall provide prompt written notice of the merger or consolidation to the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator, the Custodian and the 17g-5 Information Provider.



 Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, and for so long as, the Trust, or, with respect to any Serviced Companion Loan, the trust created pursuant to an Other Companion Loan Pooling and Servicing Agreement, is subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Master Servicer may not remain the Master Servicer under this Agreement after (x) being merged or consolidated with or into any Prohibited Party, or (y) transferring all or substantially all of its assets to any Prohibited Party, unless (i) the Master Servicer is the surviving entity of such merger, consolidation or transfer or (ii) the Depositor consents to such merger, consolidation or transfer, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld (and if, within forty-five (45) days following the date of delivery of a notice by the Master Servicer to the Depositor of any merger or similar transaction described in the preceding paragraph, the Depositor shall have failed to notify the Master Servicer of the Depositor's determination to grant or withhold such consent, such failure shall be deemed to constitute a grant of such consent).







 Section 8.22     Resignation of Master Servicer.



 (a)           Except as otherwise provided in Section 8.22(b) hereof, the Master Servicer shall not resign from the obligations and duties hereby imposed on it unless it determines that the Master Servicer's duties hereunder are no longer permissible under applicable law or are in material conflict by reason of applicable law with any other activities carried on by it.  Any such determination permitting the resignation of the Master Servicer shall be evidenced by an opinion of counsel to such effect delivered to the Trustee.  No such resignation shall become effective until a successor master servicer designated by the Trustee, with the consent of the Depositor and the Certificate Administrator, shall have assumed the Master Servicer's responsibilities and obligations under this Agreement and the Trustee shall have provided each Rating Agency and each other NRSRO with respect to any securities rated by any such NRSRO evidencing interests in any Serviced Companion Loan or B Note with a Rating Agency Communication.  Notice of such resignation shall be given promptly by the Master Servicer to the other parties to this Agreement.  The Master Servicer shall bear all costs associated with its resignation and the transfer of servicing under this Section 8.22(a).  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Master Servicer shall cease to serve as such in accordance with this Section 8.22(a) and a successor servicer shall not have been engaged, the Trustee or an agent of the Trustee shall assume the duties and obligations of the Master Servicer under this Agreement.  If the Trustee or an agent of the Trustee assumes the duties and obligations of the Master Servicer pursuant to this Section 8.22(a), the Trustee or such agent shall be permitted to resign as master servicer if it has been replaced by a successor servicer satisfying the criteria in the fourth (4th) preceding sentence above.



 (b)           The Master Servicer may resign from the obligations and duties imposed on it, upon thirty (30) days notice to the Depositor, the Trustee and the Certificate Administrator; provided that (i) a successor master servicer (A) is available, (B) has a net worth of at least $15,000,000 and (C) is willing to and does assume the obligations, responsibilities, and covenants to be performed hereunder by the Master Servicer on substantially the same terms and conditions, and for not more than equivalent compensation to that herein provided; (ii) the Master Servicer bears all costs associated with its resignation and the transfer of servicing; (iii) (A)(x) such successor master servicer is acting as master servicer in a commercial mortgage loan securitization that was rated by Moody's within the twelve (12) month period prior to the date of determination, and Moody's has not downgraded or withdrawn the then current rating on any class of commercial mortgage securities or placed any class of commercial mortgage securities on watch citing the continuation of such master servicer as master servicer of such commercial mortgage securities as the sole or material reason for such downgrade or withdrawal or placement on watch or (y) if such successor master servicer is not acting as master servicer in a commercial mortgage loan securitization that was rated by Moody's in such twelve (12) month period, then Moody's shall have provided a Rating Agency Confirmation and (B) such successor master servicer has a master servicer rating of at least "CMS3" from Fitch; and (iv) the resigning Master Servicer shall have provided each Rating Agency with a Rating Agency Communication with respect to such servicing transfer.



 Section 8.23     Assignment or Delegation of Duties by Master Servicer.  The Master Servicer shall have the right without the prior written consent of the Trustee to (A) delegate or subcontract with or authorize or appoint anyone, or delegate certain duties to







 other professionals such as attorneys and appraisers, as an agent of the Master Servicer (as provided in Section 8.4) to perform and carry out any duties, covenants or obligations to be performed and carried out by the Master Servicer hereunder or (B) assign and delegate all of its duties hereunder; provided that with respect to clause (B), (i) the Master Servicer gives the Depositor, the Special Servicer, the holder of the B Note (only if such assignment/delegation relates to the related A/B Whole Loan), the holder of the Serviced Companion Loan (only if such assignment/delegation relates to the related Loan Pair) and the Trustee notice of such assignment and delegation; (ii) such purchaser or transferee accepting such assignment and delegation executes and delivers to the Depositor and the Trustee an agreement accepting such assignment, which contains an assumption by such Person of the rights, powers, duties, responsibilities, obligations and liabilities of the Master Servicer, with like effect as if originally named as a party to this Agreement or any other subservicing agreement with any Surviving Sub-Servicer; (iii) the purchaser or transferee has a net worth in excess of $15,000,000; (iv) the Master Servicer shall have provided to each Rating Agency a Rating Agency Communication with respect to such assignment and delegation; and (v) the Depositor consents to such assignment and delegation, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld.  In the case of any such assignment and delegation in accordance with the requirements of subclause (B) of this Section, the Master Servicer shall be released from its obligations under this Agreement, except that the Master Servicer shall remain liable for all liabilities and obligations incurred by it as the Master Servicer hereunder prior to the satisfaction of the conditions to such assignment set forth in the preceding sentence.  Notwithstanding the above, the Master Servicer may appoint the Sub-Servicers in accordance with Section 8.4 hereof.



 Section 8.24     Limitation on Liability of the Master Servicer and Others.



 (a)           Neither the Master Servicer nor any of the Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, members, managers or agents of the Master Servicer shall be under any liability to the Trust, the holders of the Certificates, any other party to this Agreement, the Underwriters, the Initial Purchasers, the holder of any Serviced Companion Loan or the holder of any B Note for any action taken or for refraining from the taking of any action in good faith, or using reasonable business judgment, consistent with the Servicing Standard; provided that this provision shall not protect the Master Servicer or any such person against any breach of a representation or warranty contained herein or any liability which would otherwise be imposed by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith or negligence in its performance of duties under this Agreement or by reason of negligent disregard of obligations and duties hereunder.  The Master Servicer and any Affiliate, director, officer, employee, member, manager or agent of the Master Servicer may rely in good faith on any document of any kind prima facie properly executed and submitted by any Person (including, without limitation, the Special Servicer) respecting any matters arising hereunder.  The Master Servicer shall not be under any obligation to appear in, prosecute or defend any legal action which is not incidental to its duties to service the Mortgage Loans in accordance with this Agreement; provided that the Master Servicer may in its sole discretion undertake any such action that it may reasonably deem necessary or desirable in order to protect the interests of the Certificateholders, the Trustee and the Trust in the Mortgage Loans, the interests of the holder of any B Note or the interests of the holder of any Serviced Companion Loan (subject to the Special Servicer's servicing of Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans as contemplated herein), or shall undertake any such action if instructed to do so by the Trustee.  In such event, all legal expenses and costs of such action shall be expenses and costs of the Trust,







 and the Master Servicer shall be entitled to be reimbursed therefor as Servicing Advances as provided by Section 5.2, subject to the provisions of Section 4.4 hereof.



 (b)           In addition, the Master Servicer shall have no liability with respect to, and shall be entitled to conclusively rely on as to the truth of the statements and the correctness of the opinions expressed in, any certificates or opinions furnished to the Master Servicer and conforming to the requirements of this Agreement.  Subject to the Servicing Standard, the Master Servicer shall have the right to rely on information provided to it by the Special Servicer and Mortgagors, and will have no duty to investigate or verify the accuracy thereof.  Neither the Master Servicer, nor any Affiliate, director, officer, employee, member, manager or agent, shall be personally liable for any error of judgment made in good faith by any officer, unless it shall be proved that the Master Servicer or such Affiliate, director, officer, employee, member, manager or agent, was negligent in ascertaining the pertinent facts.  Neither the Master Servicer nor any director, officer, employee, agent or Affiliate, shall be personally liable for any action taken, suffered or omitted by it in good faith and believed by it to be authorized or within the discretion, rights or powers conferred upon it by this Agreement.



 (c)           The Master Servicer shall not be obligated to incur any liabilities, costs, charges, fees or other expenses which relate to or arise from any breach of any representation, warranty or covenant made by any other party to this Agreement in this Agreement.  The Trust shall indemnify and hold harmless the Master Servicer from any and all claims, liabilities, costs, charges, fees or other expenses which relate to or arise from any such breach of representation, warranty or covenant to the extent the Master Servicer is unable to recover such amounts from the Person in breach.



 (d)           Except as otherwise specifically provided herein:



 (i)           the Master Servicer may rely, and shall be protected in acting or refraining from acting upon, any resolution, officer's certificate, certificate of auditors or any other certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, consent, order, financial statement, agreement, appraisal, bond or other document (in electronic or paper format) reasonably believed or in good faith believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties;



 (ii)          the Master Servicer may consult with counsel, and any written advice or opinion of counsel shall be full and complete authorization and protection with respect to any action taken or suffered or omitted by it hereunder in good faith and in accordance with such advice or opinion of counsel; and



 (iii)         the Master Servicer, in preparing any reports hereunder, may rely, and shall be protected in acting or refraining from acting upon any information (financial or other), statement, certificate, document, agreement, covenant, notice, request or other paper reasonably believed by it to be genuine and provided by any Mortgagor or manager of a Mortgaged Property.



 (e)           The Master Servicer and any Affiliate, director, officer, employee, member, manager or agent of the Master Servicer shall be indemnified by the Trustee, the







 Certificate Administrator, the Custodian and the Special Servicer, as the case may be, and held harmless against any loss, liability or expense including reasonable attorneys' fees incurred in connection with any legal action relating to the Trustee's, the Certificate Administrator's, the Custodian's or the Special Servicer's, as the case may be, respective willful misfeasance, bad faith or negligence in the performance of its respective duties hereunder or by reason of negligent disregard of its respective duties hereunder, other than any loss, liability or expense incurred by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith or negligence in the performance of any of the Master Servicer's duties hereunder or by reason of negligent disregard of the Master Servicer's obligations and duties hereunder.  The Master Servicer shall immediately notify the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator, the Custodian and the Special Servicer if a claim is made by a third party with respect to this Agreement or the Mortgage Loans entitling the Master Servicer to indemnification hereunder, whereupon the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator, the Custodian or the Special Servicer, in each case, to the extent the claim is related to its respective willful misfeasance, bad faith or negligence, may assume the defense of any such claim (with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Master Servicer) and pay all expenses in connection therewith, including counsel fees, and promptly pay, discharge and satisfy any judgment or decree which may be entered against it or them in respect of such claim.  Any failure to so notify the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator, the Custodian and the Special Servicer shall not affect any rights that the Master Servicer may have to indemnification under this Agreement or otherwise, unless the Trustee's, the Certificate Administrator's, the Custodian's or the Special Servicer's defense of such claim is materially prejudiced thereby.  Such indemnity shall survive the termination of this Agreement or the resignation or removal of the Master Servicer hereunder.  Any payment hereunder made by the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator, the Custodian or the Special Servicer pursuant to this paragraph to or at the direction of the Master Servicer shall be paid from the Trustee's, the Certificate Administrator's, the Custodian's or Special Servicer's own funds, without reimbursement from the Trust therefor except to the extent achieved through subrogation as provided in this Agreement.  Any expenses incurred or indemnification payments made by the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator, the Custodian or the Special Servicer shall be reimbursed by the party so paid or at the direction of which a payment was made, if a court of competent jurisdiction makes a final judgment that the conduct of the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator, the Custodian or the Special Servicer, as the case may be, was not culpable or such indemnifying party was found to not have acted with willful misfeasance, bad faith or negligence.



 Section 8.25     Indemnification; Third-Party Claims.



 (a)           The Master Servicer and any Affiliate, director, officer, employee, member, manager or agent of the Master Servicer (the "Master Servicer Indemnified Parties") shall be indemnified and held harmless out of collections on, and other proceeds of, the Mortgage Loans, any Serviced Companion Loans and any B Notes (including REO Loans), as provided in the following paragraph, against any and all claims, losses, penalties, fines, forfeitures, legal fees and related costs, judgments and any other costs, liabilities, fees and expenses (collectively, "Master Servicer Losses") incurred in connection with any legal action relating to this Agreement, any Mortgage Loans, any Serviced Companion Loans, any B Notes, any REO Property or the Certificates or any exercise of any right under this Agreement reasonably requiring the use of counsel or the incurring of expenses, other than any loss, liability or expense:  (i) specifically required to be borne by the party seeking indemnification, without







 right of reimbursement pursuant to the terms of this Agreement; (ii) which constitutes a Servicing Advance that is otherwise reimbursable under this Agreement; (iii) incurred in connection with any legal action or claim against the party seeking indemnification, resulting from any breach on the part of that party of a representation or warranty made in this Agreement; or (iv) incurred in connection with any legal action or claim against the party seeking indemnification, resulting from any willful misfeasance, bad faith or negligence on the part of that party in the performance of its obligations or duties under this Agreement or negligent disregard of such obligations or duties.



 Except as provided in the following sentence, indemnification for Master Servicer Losses described in the preceding paragraph (including in the case of such Master Servicer Losses that relate primarily to the administration of the Trust, to any REMIC Pool or to any determination respecting the amount, payment or avoidance of any tax under the REMIC Provisions of the Code or the actual payment of any REMIC tax or expense) shall be paid out of collections on, and other proceeds of, the Mortgage Loans as a whole but not out of collections on, or other proceeds of, any Serviced Companion Loan or any B Note.  In the case of any such Master Servicer Losses that do not relate primarily to the administration of the Trust, to any REMIC Pool or to any determination respecting the amount, payment or avoidance of any tax under the REMIC Provisions of the Code or the actual payment of any REMIC tax or expense:



 (1)           if such Master Servicer Losses relate to a Loan Pair, then (subject to the related Intercreditor Agreement) such indemnification shall be paid (x) first, out of collections on, and other proceeds of, such Serviced Pari Passu Mortgage Loan and Serviced Companion Loan, in the relative proportions provided for in the applicable Intercreditor Agreement and (y) if the collections and proceeds described in subclause (x) of this clause (1) are not sufficient to so indemnify the Master Servicer Indemnified Parties on a current basis, then the balance of such indemnification shall be paid out of collections on, and other proceeds of, the Mortgage Loans as a whole; and



 (2)           if such Master Servicer Losses relate to any A/B Whole Loan, then (subject to the related Intercreditor Agreement) such indemnification shall be paid (x) first, if and to the extent permitted under the applicable Intercreditor Agreement, out of collections on, and other proceeds of such A/B Whole Loan, and (y) if the collections and proceeds described in subclause (x) of this clause (2) are not sufficient to so indemnify the Master Servicer Indemnified Parties on a current basis, then the balance of such indemnification shall be paid out of collections on, and other proceeds of, the Mortgage Loans as a whole.



 The Master Servicer shall assume the defense of any such claim (with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Master Servicer) and out of the Trust pay all expenses in connection therewith, including counsel fees, and out of the Trust promptly pay, discharge and satisfy any judgment or decree which may be entered against it or them in respect of such claim.  The indemnification provided herein shall survive the termination of this Agreement.  The Trustee, the Certificate Administrator or the Master Servicer shall promptly make from the Collection Account (and, if and to the extent that the amount due shall be paid from collections on, and other proceeds of, any Serviced Companion Loan or any B Note, as set forth above, out of the related Serviced Companion Loan Custodial Account or the related A/B Whole Loan Custodial Account) any payments certified by the Master Servicer to the Trustee and the







 Certificate Administrator as required to be made to the Master Servicer pursuant to this Section 8.25.



 (b)           The Master Servicer agrees to indemnify each other party to this Agreement, the Trust, and any director, officer, member, manager, employee, agent or Controlling Person thereof, and hold them harmless against any and all claims, losses, penalties, fines, forfeitures, legal fees and related costs, judgments, and any other costs, liabilities, fees and expenses that any such Person may sustain arising from or as a result of the willful misfeasance, bad faith or negligence in the performance of any of the Master Servicer's duties hereunder or by reason of negligent disregard of the Master Servicer's obligations and duties hereunder (including a breach of such obligations a substantial motive of which is to obtain an economic advantage from not complying with or not performing such obligations), and if in any such situation the Master Servicer is replaced, the parties hereto agree that the amount of such claims, losses, penalties, fines, legal fees and related costs, judgments, and other costs, liabilities, fees and expenses shall at least equal the incremental costs, if any, of retaining a successor servicer.  The Trustee, the Special Servicer, the Trust Advisor, the Certificate Administrator, the Custodian or the Depositor, as applicable, shall immediately notify the Master Servicer if a claim is made by any Person with respect to this Agreement or the Mortgage Loans entitling the Trustee, the Depositor, the Special Servicer, the Trust Advisor, the Certificate Administrator, the Custodian or the Trust to indemnification under this Section 8.25(b), whereupon the Master Servicer shall assume the defense of any such claim (with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, the Special Servicer, the Trust Advisor, the Certificate Administrator, the Custodian or the Depositor, as applicable) and pay all expenses in connection therewith, including counsel fees, and promptly pay, discharge and satisfy any judgment or decree which may be entered against it or them in respect of such claim.  Any failure to so notify the Master Servicer shall not affect any rights the Trustee, the Special Servicer, the Trust Advisor, the Depositor, the Certificate Administrator, the Custodian or the Trust may have to indemnification under this Agreement or otherwise, unless the Master Servicer's defense of such claim is materially prejudiced thereby.  The indemnification provided herein shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the resignation or termination of the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Trust Advisor, the Certificate Administrator, the Custodian and the Trustee.  Any expenses incurred or indemnification payments made by the Master Servicer shall be reimbursed by the party so paid or at the direction of which a payment was made, if a court of competent jurisdiction makes a final, non-appealable judgment that the conduct of the Master Servicer was not culpable or that the Master Servicer did not act with willful misfeasance, bad faith or negligence.



 (c)           Any Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan Master Servicer and any Affiliate, director, officer, employee, member, manager or agent of such Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan Master Servicer shall be indemnified by the Trust and held harmless against the Trust's pro rata share of any and all claims, losses, penalties, fines, forfeitures, legal fees and related costs, judgments and any other costs, liabilities, fees and expenses incurred in connection with any legal action relating to any Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan Pooling and Servicing Agreement and this Agreement and relating to any Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan (but excluding any such losses allocable to the related Non-Serviced Companion Loans), reasonably requiring the use of counsel or the incurring of expenses other than any losses incurred by reason of any Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan Master Servicer's willful misfeasance, bad faith or negligence in the







 performance of its duties under the related Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan Pooling and Servicing Agreement.



 Section 8.26     Loan Registry.  It is hereby acknowledged and agreed that the loan agreement for each of the Mortgage Loans identified on Schedule VIII attached to this Agreement provides that the related Mortgagor or an agent of the related Mortgagor shall maintain a register (the "Lender Register") on which it will record the related Mortgage Loan and each assignment thereof and/or participation therein.  Promptly following the Closing Date, the Master Servicer shall confirm, with respect to each of the Mortgage Loans identified on Schedule VIII attached to this Agreement, that the related Mortgagor or its agent has reflected the Trustee on behalf of the Certificateholders as the new lender on the applicable Lender Register.



 Section 8.27     Compliance with REMIC Provisions and Grantor Trust Provisions.  The Master Servicer shall act in accordance with this Agreement and the REMIC Provisions and related provisions of the Code in order to create or maintain the status of any REMIC Pool as a REMIC and the Grantor Trust created hereby as a grantor trust under the Code.  The Master Servicer shall not (A) take any action or cause any REMIC Pool to take any action that could (i) endanger the status of any REMIC Pool as a REMIC under the Code or (ii) result in the imposition of a tax upon any REMIC Pool (including, but not limited to, the tax on prohibited transactions as defined in Code Section 860F(a)(2) or on contributions pursuant to Section 860G(d)) or (B) take any action or cause the Grantor Trust to take any action that could (i) endanger its status as a grantor trust or (ii) result in the imposition of any tax upon the Grantor Trust unless the Trustee shall have received a Nondisqualification Opinion (at the expense of the party seeking to take such action) to the effect that the contemplated action will not endanger such status or result in the imposition of such tax.  The Master Servicer shall comply with the provisions of Article XII hereof.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Master Servicer shall not be liable for an Adverse REMIC Event resulting from the failure of any Mortgage Loan by its terms to comply with Revenue Procedure 2010-30, provided that the Master Servicer directly pursues any available remedies against the relevant Seller with respect to any breach or violation of a representation or warranty with respect to such Mortgage Loan's compliance with Revenue Procedure 2010-30.



 Section 8.28     Termination.  The obligations and responsibilities of the Master Servicer created hereby (other than the obligation of the Master Servicer to make payments to the Certificate Administrator as set forth in Section 8.29 and the obligations of the Master Servicer to the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator, the Custodian, the Special Servicer and the Trust that survive termination of this Agreement as provided herein) shall terminate (i) on the date which is the later of (A) the final payment or other liquidation of the last Mortgage Loan remaining outstanding (and final distribution to the Certificateholders) or (B) the disposition of all REO Property (and final distribution to the Certificateholders), (ii) if a Servicer Termination Event described in clauses 8.28(a)(iii), (iv), (viii), (ix) or (x) has occurred, sixty (60) days following the date on which the Trustee or Depositor gives written notice to the Master Servicer that the Master Servicer is terminated or (iii) if a Servicer Termination Event described in clauses 8.28(a)(i), (ii), (v), (vi) or (vii) has occurred, immediately upon the date on which the Trustee or the Depositor gives written notice to the Master Servicer that the Master Servicer is terminated.

 (ix)           if, and for so long as the Trust or a trust created pursuant to an Other Companion Loan Pooling and Servicing Agreement is subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Master Servicer or any Additional Servicer or Sub-Servicer appointed by such Master Servicer (other than any Additional Servicer that is a Seller Sub-Servicer) shall fail to deliver any Regulation AB or any Exchange Act reporting items required to be delivered by such servicer under Article XIII of this Agreement at the times required under such Article; or



 (x)           if, and for so long as the Trust or a trust created pursuant to an Other Companion Loan Pooling and Servicing Agreement is subject to the reporting requirements of Regulation AB or the Exchange Act, the Master Servicer shall fail to terminate any Sub-Servicer that is a Reporting Servicer subject to and in accordance with Section 8.4(c); provided that the Depositor may waive any such Servicer Termination Event (including waiving the failure by a Reporting Servicer to deliver any applicable reports required pursuant to Regulation AB or the Exchange Act) under this clause (x) in its sole discretion without the consent of the Trustee or any Certificateholders.



 (b)           Reserved.

 Section 8.29     Procedure Upon Termination.



 (a)           Notice of any termination pursuant to clause (i) of the first (1st) paragraph of Section 8.28, specifying the Master Servicer Remittance Date upon which the final transfer by the Master Servicer to the Certificate Administrator shall be made, shall be given promptly in writing by the Master Servicer to the Certificate Administrator no later than the later of (i) five (5) Business Days after the final payment or other liquidation of the last Mortgage Loan or (ii) the sixth (6th) day of the month of such final distribution.  Upon any such termination, the duties of the Master Servicer (other than the obligation of the Master Servicer to pay to the Certificate Administrator the amounts remaining in the Collection Account as set forth below and the obligations of the Master Servicer to the Trustee and the Trust that survive termination of this Agreement as provided herein) shall terminate and the Master Servicer shall transfer to the Certificate Administrator the amounts remaining in the Collection Account (and any sub-account) after making the withdrawals permitted to be made pursuant to Section 5.2 and shall thereafter terminate the Collection Account and any other account or fund maintained with respect to the Mortgage Loans.



 (b)           On the date specified in a written notice of termination given to the Master Servicer pursuant to clause (ii) of the first (1st) paragraph of Section 8.28, or on the date on which a written notice of termination is given to the Master Servicer pursuant to clause (iii) of the first (1st) paragraph of Section 8.28 all authority, power and rights of the Master Servicer under this Agreement, whether with respect to the Mortgage Loans or otherwise, shall terminate (except for any rights relating to indemnification, unpaid servicing compensation or unreimbursed Advances and related interest); provided that in no event shall the termination of the Master Servicer be effective until a successor master servicer shall have (i)  succeeded the Master Servicer as successor master servicer, (ii) notified the Master Servicer of such succession and (iii) assumed the Master Servicer's obligations and responsibilities under this Agreement pursuant to a writing executed by the successor master servicer and delivered to each of the other parties hereto.  Except as provided in the next sentence, the Trustee may not succeed the Master Servicer as servicer until and unless it has satisfied the provisions that would apply to a Person succeeding to the business of the Master Servicer pursuant to Section 8.22(b) hereof.  Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if the Master Servicer is terminated as a result of an event described in Section 8.28(a)(v), 8.28(a)(vi) or 8.28(a)(vii), the Trustee shall act as







 successor servicer immediately upon delivery of a notice of termination to the Master Servicer and shall use commercially reasonable efforts within ninety (90) days of assuming the duties of the Master Servicer, either to satisfy the conditions of Section 8.22(b) hereof or to transfer the duties of the Master Servicer to a successor servicer who has satisfied such conditions.  The Trustee is hereby authorized and empowered to execute and deliver, on behalf of the Master Servicer, as attorney-in-fact or otherwise, any and all documents and other instruments, and to do or accomplish all other acts or things necessary or appropriate to effect the purposes of such notice of termination, whether to complete the transfer and endorsement or assignment of the Mortgage Loans and related documents or otherwise.  The Master Servicer agrees to cooperate with the Trustee, the Custodian and the Certificate Administrator in effecting the termination of the Master Servicer's responsibilities and rights hereunder as Master Servicer including, without limitation, notifying Mortgagors of the assignment of the servicing function and providing the Trustee all documents and records in electronic or other form reasonably requested by it to enable the successor servicer designated by the Trustee to assume the Master Servicer's functions hereunder and to effect the transfer to such successor for administration by it of all amounts which shall at the time be or should have been deposited by the Master Servicer in the Collection Account and any other account or fund maintained or thereafter received with respect to the Mortgage Loans.



 (c)           If (i) the Master Servicer receives a written notice of termination (A) pursuant to clause (ii) of the first (1st) paragraph of Section 8.28 relating solely to a Servicer Termination Event set forth in clause (viii) or (ix) of Section 8.28(a) or (B) pursuant to Section 8.21 and (ii) the Master Servicer provides the Trustee with the appropriate "request for proposal" materials within five (5) Business Days after receipt of such written notice of termination, then the Trustee shall promptly thereafter (using such "request for proposal" materials provided by the Master Servicer) solicit good faith bids for the rights to service the Mortgage Loans under this Agreement from at least three (3) but no more than five (5) Qualified Bidders or, if three (3) Qualified Bidders cannot be located, then from as many persons as the Trustee can determine are Qualified Bidders.  At the Trustee's request, the Master Servicer shall supply the Trustee with the names of Persons from whom to solicit such bids.  In no event shall the Trustee be responsible if less than three (3) Qualified Bidders submit bids for the right to service the Mortgage Loans under this Agreement.



 (d)           Each bid proposal shall require any Successful Bidder, as a condition of its bid, to (i) enter into this Agreement as successor master servicer and (ii) agree to be bound by the terms hereof, not later than sixty (60) days after termination of the Master Servicer hereunder.  The Trustee shall select the Qualified Bidder with the highest cash bid (or such other Qualified Bidder as the Master Servicer may direct) (the "Successful Bidder") to act as successor master servicer hereunder.  The Trustee shall direct the Successful Bidder to enter into this Agreement as successor master servicer pursuant to the terms hereof, and in connection therewith to deliver the amount of the Successful Bidder's cash bid to the Trustee or its designee by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account specified by the Trustee or its designee no later than 10:00 axxPDmxxPD New York City time on the date specified for the assignment and assumption of the servicing rights hereunder.



 (e)           Upon the assignment and acceptance of the servicing rights hereunder to and by the Successful Bidder and receipt of such cash bid, the Trustee shall remit or cause to be







 remitted to the terminated Master Servicer the amount of such cash bid received from the Successful Bidder (net of all out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with obtaining such bid and transferring servicing) by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account specified by the terminated Master Servicer no later than 1:00 pxxPDmxxPD New York City time on the date specified for the assignment and assumption of the servicing rights hereunder.



 (f)           If the Successful Bidder has not entered into this Agreement as successor Master Servicer within thirty (30) days after the termination of the Master Servicer hereunder or no Successful Bidder was identified within such 30-day period, the Trustee shall have no further obligations under Section 8.29(c) and may act or may select another successor to act as Master Servicer hereunder in accordance with Section 8.29(b).



 (g)           If the Master Servicer is terminated as a result of an event described in Section 8.28(a)(viii), then the Master Servicer shall have the right to enter into a sub-servicing agreement or primary servicing agreement with the successor master servicer with respect to all applicable Mortgage Loans that are not subject to a sub-servicing agreement or primary servicing agreement, if the Master Servicer (i) is acting as primary servicer in a commercial mortgage loan securitization that was rated by Moody's within the twelve (12) month period prior to the date of determination, and Moody's has not downgraded or withdrawn the then current rating on any class of commercial mortgage securities or placed any class of commercial mortgage securities on watch citing the continuation of such primary servicer as primary servicer of such commercial mortgage securities as the sole or material reason for such downgrade or withdrawal (or placement on watch) and (ii) has a master servicer rating of at least "CMS3" from Fitch or, in the case of each such Rating Agency, be otherwise acceptable to such Rating Agency as evidenced by a Rating Agency Confirmation.



 (h)           If the Trustee or an Affiliate acts pursuant to this Section 8.29 as successor to the resigning or terminated Master Servicer, it may reduce the Excess Servicing Fee Rate to the extent that its or such Affiliate's compensation as successor Master Servicer would otherwise be below the market rate servicing compensation.  If the Trustee elects to appoint a successor to the resigning or terminated Master Servicer other than itself or an Affiliate pursuant to this Section 8.29, it may reduce the Excess Servicing Fee Rate to the extent reasonably necessary (in the sole discretion of the Trustee) for the Trustee to appoint a qualified successor Master Servicer that meets the requirements of this Section 8.29.



 Section 8.30     Certain Matters with Respect to Joint Mortgage Loans.



 (a)           If a Seller of a Joint Mortgage Loan (a "Repurchasing Seller") repurchases, or substitutes for, the Mortgage Note(s) (as such term is defined in this Section 8.30(a)) (a "Repurchased Note") related to such Joint Mortgage Loan that it sold to the Depositor, but the other Seller of such Joint Mortgage Loan does not repurchase, or substitute for, the Mortgage Note(s) related to such Joint Mortgage Loan that it sold to the Depositor, the provisions of this Section 8.30 shall apply prior to the adoption, pursuant to Section 14.3(i), of any amendment to this Agreement that provides otherwise.  Each Seller of a Joint Mortgage Loan has agreed pursuant to the terms of the related Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement that the terms set forth in this Section 8.30 with respect to the servicing and administration of such Joint Mortgage Loan shall apply if one or more of the Mortgage Notes related to such Joint Mortgage







 Loan has been repurchased or, by way of substitution, otherwise removed from the Trust and at least one other Mortgage Note related to such Joint Mortgage Loan is included in the Trust until such time as all of the Mortgage Notes related to such Joint Mortgage Loan are no longer included in the Trust.  For purposes of this Section 8.30, Section 14.3(i) and Section 14.9 only, "Mortgage Note" shall mean with respect to any Joint Mortgage Loan, each original promissory note that collectively represents the Mortgage Note (as defined in Article I) with respect to such Joint Mortgage Loan and shall not be a collective reference to such promissory notes.



 (b)           Custody of and record title under the Mortgage Loan documents with respect to the applicable Joint Mortgage Loan shall be held exclusively by the Custodian (on behalf of the Trustee) as provided under this Agreement, except that the Repurchasing Seller shall hold and retain title to its original Repurchased Note and any related endorsements thereof.



 (i)           All of the Mortgage Notes with respect to any Joint Mortgage Loan shall be of equal priority, and no portion of any Mortgage Note shall have priority or preference over any other portion of the other Mortgage Notes or security therefor.  Payments from the related Mortgagor (including, without limitation, any Late Fees) or any other amounts received with respect to each Mortgage Note shall be collected as provided in this Agreement by the Master Servicer and shall be applied upon receipt by the Master Servicer pro rata to each related Mortgage Note based on its respective Repurchased Percentage Interest (as defined in Section 8.30(b)(ii)), subject to Section 8.30(b)(ii).  Payments or any other amounts received with respect to the related Repurchased Note shall be held in trust for the benefit of the applicable Repurchasing Seller and remitted (net of its pro rata share of any Master Servicing Fees, Special Servicing Fees, Trust Advisor Fees and any other amounts due to the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer) to the applicable Repurchasing Seller or its designee by the Master Servicer on each Distribution Date pursuant to instructions provided by the applicable Repurchasing Seller and deposited and applied in accordance with this Agreement, subject to Section 8.30(b)(ii).  If any Joint Mortgage Loan to which this Section 8.30 applies becomes an REO Loan, payments or any other amounts received with respect to any such Joint Mortgage Loan shall be collected and shall be applied upon receipt by the Master Servicer pro rata to each related Mortgage Note based on its respective Repurchased Percentage Interest, subject to Section 8.30(b)(ii).  Any Appraisal Reductions calculated with respect to any Joint Mortgage Loan subject to this Section 8.30 shall be allocated to each related Mortgage Note pro rata based upon the respective Unpaid Principal Balances thereof.



 (ii)          If the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as applicable, receives an aggregate payment of less than the aggregate amount due under any such Joint Mortgage Loan at any particular time, the applicable Repurchasing Seller shall receive from the Master Servicer an amount equal to such Repurchasing Seller's Repurchased Percentage Interest of such payment.  All expenses, losses and shortfalls relating solely to such Joint Mortgage Loan including, without limitation, losses of principal or interest, Nonrecoverable Advances, interest on Servicing Advances, Trust Advisor Expenses, Special Servicing Fees, Workout Fees and Liquidation Fees (including any such fees related to the applicable Mortgage Notes), shall be allocated between the holders of the related Mortgage Notes pro rata based upon the respective Unpaid Principal Balances thereof.  In no event shall any costs, expenses, fees or any other amounts related to any Mortgage Loan or Joint Mortgage Loan other than the applicable Joint Mortgage Loan be deducted from payments or any other amounts received with respect to such







 Joint Mortgage Loan and payable to the applicable Repurchasing Seller.  For purposes of Section 8.30(b)(i), this Section 8.30(b)(ii) and Section 8.30(g), "Repurchased Percentage Interest" shall mean the percentage interest of the applicable Seller in the applicable Joint Mortgage Loan.



 (iii)         A Joint Mortgage Loan to which this Section 8.30 applies shall be serviced for the benefit of the applicable Repurchasing Seller and the Certificateholders pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Agreement in accordance with the Servicing Standard and in accordance with the provisions herein as if (A) such Joint Mortgage Loan were a Loan Pair, (B) the related Mortgage Note(s) not repurchased were (1) a Serviced Pari Passu Mortgage Loan and (2) the only Mortgage Loan that is part of such Joint Mortgage Loan, and (C) the related Repurchased Note were a Serviced Companion Loan.  No Repurchasing Seller shall be permitted to terminate the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer or the Trust Advisor as servicer, special servicer or trust advisor, respectively, of the related Repurchased Note.  All rights of the mortgagee under each such Joint Mortgage Loan shall be exercised by the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, on behalf of the Trust to the extent of its interest therein and the applicable Repurchasing Seller in accordance with this Agreement.



 (iv)        The related Repurchasing Seller shall be treated hereunder as if it were a Serviced Companion Loan noteholder on a pari passu basis.  Funds collected by the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as applicable, and applied to the applicable Mortgage Notes shall be deposited and disbursed in accordance with the provisions hereof relating to holders of Loan Pairs that are pari passu in right of payment.  Compensation shall be paid to the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer and the Trust Advisor with respect to each Repurchased Note as provided in this Agreement as if each such Mortgage Note were a Serviced Companion Loan.  None of the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator, the Custodian, the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer or the Trust Advisor shall have any obligation to make P&I Advances with respect to any Repurchased Note or, if no related Mortgage Note is part of the Trust, a Servicing Advance with respect to any Repurchased Note.  Except as otherwise specified herein, the Master Servicer and the Special Servicer shall have no reporting requirement with respect to any Repurchased Note other than to deliver to the related Repurchasing Seller any document as is required to be delivered to a holder of a Serviced Companion Loan hereunder.



 (c)           If any non-repurchased Mortgage Note relating to a Joint Mortgage Loan to which this Section 8.30 applies is considered a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan, then any related Repurchased Note shall also be a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan under this Agreement.  The Special Servicer shall cause such related Repurchased Note to be specially serviced for the benefit of the applicable Repurchasing Seller in accordance with the terms and provisions set forth in this Agreement and shall be entitled to any Special Servicing Fee, Workout Fee or Liquidation Fee payable to the Special Servicer under this Agreement as with respect to a Serviced Companion Loan.



 (d)           If (A) the Master Servicer shall pay any amount to any Repurchasing Seller pursuant to the terms hereof in the belief or expectation that a related payment has been made or will be received or collected in connection with either or both of the applicable Mortgage Notes and (B) such related payment is not received or collected by the Master Servicer, then the applicable Repurchasing Seller shall promptly on demand by the Master Servicer return such amount to the Master Servicer.  If the Master Servicer determines at any







 time that any amount received or collected by the Master Servicer in respect of any Joint Mortgage Loans to which this Section 8.30 applies must be returned to the related Mortgagor or paid to any other person or entity pursuant to any insolvency law or otherwise, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Master Servicer shall not be required to distribute any portion thereof to the related Repurchasing Seller, and such Repurchasing Seller shall promptly on demand by the Master Servicer repay (which obligation shall survive the termination of this Agreement) any portion thereof that the Master Servicer shall have distributed to such Repurchasing Seller, together with interest thereon at such rate, if any, as the Master Servicer may pay to the related Mortgagor or such other person or entity with respect thereto.



 (e)           Subject to this Agreement (including, without limitation, the consent and consultation rights of the Controlling Class Representative and any consultation rights of the Trust Advisor), the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as applicable, on behalf of the holders of any of the Repurchased Notes, shall have the exclusive right and obligation to (i) administer, service and make all decisions and determinations regarding the related Joint Mortgage Loan and (ii) enforce the applicable Mortgage Loan documents as provided hereunder.  Without limiting the generality of the preceding sentence, the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as applicable, may agree to any modification, waiver or amendment of any term of, forgive interest on and principal of, capitalize interest on, permit the release, addition or substitution of collateral securing, and/or permit the release of the related Mortgagor on or any guarantor of any Joint Mortgage Loan it is required to service and administer as contemplated by this Section 8.30, without the consent of the related Repurchasing Seller, subject, however, to the terms of this Agreement as they pertain to a Serviced Companion Loan.



 (f)           In taking or refraining from taking any action permitted hereunder, the Master Servicer and the Special Servicer shall each be subject to the same degree of care with respect to the administration and servicing of the Joint Mortgage Loans to which this Section 8.30 applies as is consistent with this Agreement; and shall be liable to any Repurchasing Seller only to the same extent as set forth herein with respect to any holder of a Serviced Companion Loan.



 (g)           If the Trustee, the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer has made a Servicing Advance with respect to any Repurchased Note which would otherwise be reimbursable to such advancing party under this Agreement, and such Advance is determined to be a Nonrecoverable Advance, the applicable Repurchasing Seller shall reimburse the Trust in an amount equal to such Repurchasing Seller's Repurchased Percentage Interest of such Nonrecoverable Advance with interest thereon.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the applicable Repurchasing Seller shall not be obligated to reimburse the Trustee, the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer (and amounts due to the applicable Repurchasing Seller shall not be offset) for Advances or interest thereon or any amounts related to any Mortgage Loans or any other Joint Mortgage Loan other than such amounts relating to the applicable Repurchased Note.  To the extent that the applicable Repurchasing Seller reimburses any such Nonrecoverable Advances and such amounts are subsequently recovered, the applicable Repurchasing Seller shall receive a reimbursement from such recovery based on its Repurchased Percentage Interest of such recovery.  This reimbursement right shall not limit the Trustee's, the Master Servicer's or the Special Servicer's rights to reimbursement under this Agreement.  Notwithstanding anything to







 the contrary contained herein, the total liability of each Repurchasing Seller shall not exceed an amount equal to its Repurchased Percentage Interest of the amount to be reimbursed.



 (h)           Each Repurchasing Seller shall have the right to assign the related Repurchased Note; provided that the assignee of the related Repurchased Note shall agree in writing to be bound by the terms of this Agreement.



 (i)           The Master Servicer and the Special Servicer shall, in connection with their servicing and administrative duties under this Agreement, exercise efforts consistent with the Servicing Standard to execute and deliver, on behalf of each Repurchasing Seller as a holder of a pari passu interest in the applicable Joint Mortgage Loan, any and all financing statements, continuation statements and other documents and instruments necessary to maintain the lien created by any Mortgage or other security document related to the applicable Joint Mortgage Loan on the related Mortgaged Property and related collateral, any and all modifications, waivers, amendments or consents to or with respect to the related Joint Mortgage Loan documents, and any and all instruments of satisfaction or cancellation, or of full release or discharge, and all other comparable instruments with respect to the related Repurchased Note or related Repurchased Notes and the related Mortgaged Property all in accordance with, and subject to, the terms of this Agreement.  Each Repurchasing Seller agrees to furnish, or cause to be furnished, to the Master Servicer and the Special Servicer any powers of attorney or other documents necessary or appropriate to enable the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as the case may be, to carry out its servicing and administrative duties under this Agreement related to the applicable Joint Mortgage Loan; provided that such Repurchasing Seller shall not be liable, and shall be indemnified by the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as applicable, for any negligence with respect to, or misuse of, any such power of attorney by the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as the case may be; and further provided that the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, without the written consent of the applicable Repurchasing Seller, shall not initiate any action in the name of such Repurchasing Seller without indicating its representative capacity or take any action with the intent to cause and that actually causes, such Repurchasing Seller to be registered to do business in any state.



 Pursuant to the related Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement, the applicable Repurchasing Seller is required to deliver to the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as applicable, the Mortgage Loan documents related to the applicable Repurchased Note, any requests for release and any court pleadings, requests for trustee's sale or other documents necessary to the foreclosure or trustee's sale in respect of the related Mortgaged Property or to any legal action or to enforce any other remedies or rights provided by the Mortgage Note(s) or the Mortgage(s) or otherwise available at law or equity with respect to the related Repurchased Note.

 A/B Whole Loan, for the benefit of the holder of the related B Note and, solely as it relates to any Loan Pair, for the benefit of the holder of the related Serviced Companion Loan, the Special Servicer shall service the Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans and manage the related REO Properties in accordance with the Servicing Standard and the terms of this Agreement.  Certain of the provisions of this Article IX make explicit reference to their applicability to Mortgage Loans, any Serviced Companion Loan and any B Note; notwithstanding such explicit references, references in this Article IX to "Mortgage Loans" shall be construed, unless otherwise specified, to refer also to such B Note and such Serviced Companion Loan (but any other terms that are defined in Article I and used in this Article IX shall be construed according to such definitions without regard to this sentence).



 (b)           Subject to Section 5.4(e), the Special Servicer shall cooperate with the Master Servicer and provide the Master Servicer with the information reasonably requested by the Master Servicer, in writing, to the extent required to allow the Master Servicer to perform its servicing obligations with respect to the Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans hereunder.  The Special Servicer's obligations with respect to the servicing of any Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan and any related REO Properties shall terminate when such Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan has become a Rehabilitated Mortgage Loan, unless and until another Servicing Transfer Event with respect to such Rehabilitated Mortgage Loan occurs.



 (c)           The Special Servicer shall send a written notice to the Master Servicer, the Controlling Class Representative (during any Subordinate Control Period and any Collective Consultation Period), the Trust Advisor (other than during any Subordinate Control Period), any holder of a related B Note or Serviced Companion Loan and the Certificate Administrator within five (5) Business Days after becoming aware that a Mortgage Loan has become a Rehabilitated Mortgage Loan, which notice shall identify the applicable Mortgage Loan.  Upon the receipt of such notice by the Master Servicer and the Certificate Administrator, such Mortgage Loan shall constitute a Rehabilitated Mortgage Loan and will be serviced by the Master Servicer.



 (d)           Upon the occurrence of a Servicing Transfer Event with respect to a Mortgage Loan and upon the reasonable request of the Special Servicer, the Master Servicer shall mark its records for such Mortgage Loan to cause any monthly statements for amounts due on such Mortgage Loan to be sent thereafter to the Special Servicer rather than the related Mortgagor.  Upon receipt of any such monthly statement, the Special Servicer shall, within two (2) Business Days, advise the Master Servicer of any changes to be made, and return the monthly statement to the Master Servicer.  The Master Servicer shall thereafter promptly send the corrected monthly statement to the Mortgagor.  If a Mortgage Loan becomes a Rehabilitated Mortgage Loan, the Master Servicer shall resume sending the monthly statements to the Mortgagor as it did before such Mortgage Loan became a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan.



 (e)           All amounts collected by the Master Servicer with respect to a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan (other than a Mortgage Loan that has become an REO Mortgage Loan and a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan that is a B Note or Serviced Companion Loan) shall be deposited in the Collection Account, and all amounts collected by the Master Servicer with respect to a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan that is a B Note shall be deposited in the related A/B Whole Loan Custodial Account and all amounts collected by the Master Servicer with respect to a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan that is a Serviced Companion Loan shall be







 deposited in the related Serviced Companion Loan Custodial Account.  The Master Servicer shall within three (3) Business Days after receipt of any such payment, notify the Special Servicer of the receipt of such payment and the amount thereof.  The Special Servicer shall, within two (2) Business Days thereafter, instruct the Master Servicer in writing how to apply such payment (with the application of such payments to be made in accordance with the related Mortgage Loan documents (including the related Intercreditor Agreement, if any) or in accordance with this Agreement, as applicable).  The Special Servicer shall make efforts consistent with the Servicing Standard and the terms of this Agreement to collect all special servicing fees, liquidation fees and workout fees called for under the terms and provisions of the Mortgage Loan documents for each applicable Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan.



 (f)           After the occurrence of any Servicing Transfer Event with respect to any one or more Mortgage Loans (other than any Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan) that are the subject of any Environmental Insurance Policy, (i) the Special Servicer shall monitor the dates by which any claim must be made or action must be taken under such Environmental Insurance Policy to achieve the payment of all amounts thereunder to which the Trust is entitled if the Special Servicer has actual knowledge of any event giving rise to a claim under such Environmental Insurance Policy and (ii) if the Special Servicer has actual knowledge of such an event with respect to such Mortgage Loan, the Special Servicer shall take reasonable actions as are in accordance with the Servicing Standard and the terms and conditions of the related Environmental Insurance Policy to make a claim thereunder and achieve the payment of all amounts to which the Trust is entitled thereunder.  Any legal fees or other out-of-pocket costs incurred in accordance with the Servicing Standard in connection with any such claim shall be paid by, and reimbursable to, the Master Servicer (of if applicable, the Special Servicer) as a Servicing Advance.  All extraordinary expenses (but not ordinary and routine or anticipated expenses) incurred by the Special Servicer in fulfilling its obligations under this Section 9.1(f) shall be paid by the Trust.



 Section 9.2     Fidelity Bond and Errors and Omissions Insurance Policy of Special Servicer.  The Special Servicer, at its expense, shall maintain in effect a Servicer Fidelity Bond and a Servicer Errors and Omissions Insurance Policy.  The Servicer Errors and Omissions Insurance Policy and Servicer Fidelity Bond shall be issued by a Qualified Insurer (unless the Special Servicer self-insures as provided below) and be in form and amount consistent with the Servicing Standard.  If any such Servicer Errors and Omissions Insurance Policy or Servicer Fidelity Bond ceases to be in effect, the Special Servicer shall obtain a comparable replacement policy or bond from an insurer or issuer meeting the requirements set forth above as of the date of such replacement.  So long as the long-term rating of the Special Servicer is not less than two (2) rating categories (ignoring pluses or minuses) lower than the highest rating of the Certificates, but not less than ''A-'' as rated by Fitch and not less than "A3" as rated by Moody's, the Special Servicer may self-insure for the Servicer Fidelity Bond and the Servicer Errors and Omissions Insurance Policy.



 Section 9.3     Special Servicer General Powers and Duties.



 (a)           Subject to the other terms and provisions of this Agreement (and, in the case of any Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan, subject to the servicing of such Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan by the applicable Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan Master Servicer and the







 applicable Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan Special Servicer), including Section 10.3, the Special Servicer is hereby authorized and empowered when the Special Servicer believes it appropriate in accordance with the Servicing Standard, to take any and all the actions with respect to Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans that the Master Servicer may perform as set forth in Section 8.3(a), including (i) to execute and deliver, on behalf of itself or the Trust (or holder of a B Note or Serviced Companion Loan, as applicable), any and all instruments of satisfaction or cancellation, or of partial or full release or discharge and all other comparable instruments, with respect to the Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans and with respect to the related REO Properties and (ii) to effectuate foreclosure or other conversion of the ownership of any Mortgaged Property securing a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan.  The Trustee shall execute on the Closing Date a Power of Attorney substantially in the form of Exhibit O-2 (or such other form as mutually agreed to by the Trustee and the Special Servicer) hereto and otherwise reasonably acceptable to the Trustee and Special Servicer and shall furnish the Special Servicer from time to time, upon a written request from a Special Servicing Officer, with any additional powers of attorney of the Trustee, substantially in the form of Exhibit O-2 (or such other form as mutually agreed to by the Trustee and the Special Servicer) with such additions as may be reasonably necessary to empower the Special Servicer to take such actions as it determines to be reasonably necessary to comply with its servicing, administrative and management duties hereunder, and the Trustee shall execute and deliver or cause to be executed and delivered such other documents as a Special Servicing Officer may request in writing, that are necessary or appropriate to enable the Special Servicer to service, administer and manage the Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans and carry out its duties hereunder, in each case as the Special Servicer determines is in accordance with the Servicing Standard and the terms of this Agreement; provided, that, the Special Servicer shall not (i) take any action with the intent to cause and that actually causes the Trustee to be registered to do business in any state; and (ii) without the Trustee's prior written consent initiate any action, suit or proceeding solely under the Trustee's name without indicating the Special Servicer's representative capacity; provided, further, that the preceding clause (ii) shall not apply to the initiation of actions relating to a Mortgage Loan that the Special Servicer is servicing pursuant to its respective duties herein (in which case the Special Servicer shall give prompt prior notice to the Trustee of the initiation of such action).  Upon receipt of any such advice from the Trustee, the Special Servicer shall take such action in the name of such Person or Persons, in trust for the Trust (or holder of a B Note or Serviced Companion Loan, if applicable), as shall be consistent with the Opinion of Counsel obtained by the Trustee.  Such Person or Persons shall acknowledge in writing that such action is being taken by the Special Servicer in the name of the Trust (or holder of a B Note or the Serviced Companion Loan, if applicable).  In the performance of its duties hereunder, the Special Servicer shall be an independent contractor and shall not, except in those instances where it is, after notice to the Trustee as provided above, taking action in the name of the Trust (or holder of a B Note or the Serviced Companion Loan, if applicable), be deemed to be the agent of the Trust (or holder of a B Note or the Serviced Companion Loan, as applicable).  The Special Servicer shall indemnify the Trustee for any loss, liability or reasonable expense (including attorneys' fees) incurred by the Trustee or any director, officer, employee, agent or Controlling Person of it or its affiliates in connection with any negligent or intentional misuse of the foregoing powers of attorney furnished to the Special Servicer by the Trustee.  Such indemnification shall survive the resignation or termination of the Special Servicer hereunder, the resignation or termination of the Trustee and the termination of this Agreement.  The Special Servicer shall not have any responsibility or liability for any act or







 omission of the Trustee, the Custodian, the Master Servicer or the Depositor that is not attributable to the failure of the Special Servicer to perform its obligations hereunder.  The Special Servicer may conclusively rely on any advice of counsel rendered in a Nondisqualification Opinion.



 (b)           In servicing and administering the Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans and managing any related REO Properties, the Special Servicer shall employ procedures consistent with the Servicing Standard.  The Special Servicer shall inspect, or cause to be inspected:  (i) each Mortgaged Property relating to a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan as soon as practicable after the subject Mortgage Loan became a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan and thereafter at least every twelve (12) months until such Mortgage Loan ceases to be a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan; and (ii) each Mortgaged Property related to a Mortgage Loan (other than any Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan) that is delinquent for sixty (60) days in the payment of any amounts due under such Mortgage Loan (provided that if the related Mortgage Loan is not a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan the Master Servicer shall have given the Special Servicer notice of such delinquency).  The Special Servicer shall provide to the Master Servicer (who shall provide, solely as it relates to any A/B Whole Loan, to the holder of the related B Note, and solely as it relates to any Loan Pair, to the holder of the related Serviced Companion Loan), the Certificate Administrator, the 17g-5 Information Provider and, during any Subordinate Control Period and any Collective Consultation Period, the Controlling Class Representative copies of the Inspection Reports relating to such inspections as soon as practicable after the completion of any inspection.  Any cost of any inspection performed under this Section 9.3(b) shall be an expense of the Trust and shall be treated as a Servicing Advance or as an Additional Trust Expense if such Servicing Advance would be a Nonrecoverable Advance.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Special Servicer shall not be liable for its failure to prepare the reports required pursuant to this Section 9.3(b) with respect to any Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan or REO Property if such failure is directly caused by the Master Servicer's failure to perform its obligations or provide information to the Special Servicer as required by this Agreement.



 (c)           Pursuant to the related Intercreditor Agreement, each owner of a Serviced Companion Loan has agreed that the Master Servicer and the Special Servicer are authorized and obligated to service and administer such Serviced Companion Loan pursuant to this Agreement.



 (d)           Pursuant to the applicable Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan Intercreditor Agreement, the owners of a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan have agreed that such owner's rights in, to and under such Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan are subject to the servicing and all other rights of the applicable Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan Master Servicer and the applicable Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan Special Servicer and such Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan Master Servicer and Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan Special Servicer are authorized and obligated to service and administer such Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan pursuant to the related Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan Pooling and Servicing Agreement.  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the Special Servicer's obligations and responsibilities hereunder and the Special Servicer's authority with respect to any Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan are limited by and subject to the terms of the applicable Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan Intercreditor Agreement and the rights of the applicable Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan Master Servicer and the applicable Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan Special Servicer with respect thereto under the related Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan Pooling and Servicing Agreement.  The







 Special Servicer shall take such actions as it shall deem reasonably necessary to facilitate the servicing of any Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan by the applicable Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan Master Servicer and the applicable Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan Special Servicer including, but not limited to, delivering appropriate Requests for Release to the Trustee and Custodian (if any) in order to deliver any portion of the related Mortgage File to the applicable Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan Master Servicer or applicable Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan Special Servicer under the related Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan Pooling and Servicing Agreement.



 (e)           Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, with respect to the Non-Serviced Mortgage Loans, (i) during any Subordinate Control Period and any Collective Consultation Period, the Controlling Class Representative shall be entitled to the rights of the "Non-Directing Holder" (or similar term) under the related Intercreditor Agreement and (ii) at no time shall the Trust Advisor be entitled to the rights of the "Non-Directing Holder" (or similar term) under the related Intercreditor Agreement.



 Section 9.4     Sub-Servicers.  The Special Servicer shall have the right to use a Sub-Servicer on the same terms and conditions as those set forth in Section 8.4 for a Sub-Servicer of the Master Servicer, except as set forth in this Section 9.4.  The Special Servicer shall notify the Master Servicer, Trustee, Custodian and solely as it relates to any A/B Whole Loan, the holder of the related B Note, and solely as it relates to any Loan Pair, the holder of the related Serviced Companion Loan, of the appointment of any Sub-Servicer of the Special Servicer.  The Special Servicer shall be solely responsible for the payment of compensation to any Sub-Servicer appointed by it.  The Special Servicer shall not enter into future sub-servicing contracts unless it has provided to each Rating Agency a Rating Agency Communication with respect thereto.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, (i) the Special Servicer shall not enter into any sub-servicing agreement that provides for the performance by third parties of any or all of its obligations hereunder, without the consent of the Applicable Control Party, except to the extent necessary for the Special Servicer to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, (ii) no sub-servicer shall be permitted under any sub-servicing agreement to make material servicing decisions, such as loan modifications or determinations as to the manner or timing of enforcing remedies under the Mortgage Loan documents, without the consent of the Special Servicer and (iii) after the Closing Date, if and for so long as the Trust or, with respect to any Serviced Companion Loan, the trust created pursuant to an Other Companion Loan Pooling and Servicing Agreement, are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Special Servicer, shall not enter into a sub-servicing agreement with any Prohibited Party.



 Section 9.5     "Due-on-Sale" Clauses; Assignment and Assumption Agreements; Modifications of Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans; Due-on-Encumbrance Clauses.  Subject to Section 10.3, the terms and conditions of any related Intercreditor Agreement (in the case of any A/B Whole Loan or Loan Pair) and the limitations of Section 12.3, the Special Servicer shall have the following duties and rights:







 (a)           If any Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan contains a provision in the nature of a "due-on-sale" clause, which by its terms:



 (i)           provides that such Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan shall (or may at the Mortgagee's option) become due and payable upon the sale or other transfer of an interest in the related Mortgaged Property or ownership interest in the related Mortgagor, or



 (ii)          provides that such Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan may not be assumed, or ownership interests in the related Mortgagor may not be transferred, without the consent of the related Mortgagee in connection with any such sale or other transfer;



 then, the Special Servicer, on behalf of the Trust, shall, subject to Section 10.3 and, in the case of any A/B Whole Loan or Loan Pair, the related Intercreditor Agreement, and in accordance with the Servicing Standard and the REMIC Provisions, take such actions as it deems to be in the best economic interest of the Trust in accordance with the Servicing Standard, and may waive or enforce any due-on-sale clause contained in the related Mortgage Note or Mortgage; provided, that the Special Servicer provides each Rating Agency with a Rating Agency Communication prior to waiving the effect of such provision.  In connection with each such Rating Agency Communication, the Special Servicer shall prepare and, subject to Section 5.7, deliver to the Rating Agencies a memorandum outlining its analysis and recommendation in accordance with the Servicing Standard, together with copies of all relevant documentation.  As to any Mortgage Loan (other than any Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan) that is not a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan and contains a provision in the nature of a "due-on-sale" clause, the Special Servicer shall have the rights and duties set forth in Section 8.7(a).



 In connection with the waiver of any due-on-sale clause under a Mortgage Loan in accordance with this Section 9.5(a), the Special Servicer is authorized to take or enter into an assignment and assumption agreement from or with the Person to whom such property has been or is about to be conveyed, and/or to release the original Mortgagor from liability upon the Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan and substitute the new Mortgagor as obligor thereon; provided that, except as otherwise permitted by Section 9.5(c), any such assignment and assumption or substitution agreement shall contain no terms that could result in an Adverse REMIC Event.  To the extent permitted by law, the Special Servicer shall enter into an assumption or substitution agreement that is required under the related Mortgage Loan documents (either as a matter of right or upon satisfaction of specified conditions) and shall otherwise enter into any assumption or substitution agreement only if the credit status of the prospective new mortgagor and the underwriting of the new mortgagor is in compliance with the Special Servicer's regular commercial mortgage origination or servicing standards and criteria.  The Special Servicer shall notify the Master Servicer of any such assignment and assumption or substitution agreement and the Special Servicer shall forward to the Custodian (on the Trustee's behalf) the original of such agreement, which original shall be added by the Custodian (on the Trustee's behalf) to the related Mortgage File and shall, for all purposes, be considered a part of such Mortgage File to the same extent as all other documents and instruments constituting a part thereof.



 (b)           In connection with any assignment and assumption of a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan, in no event shall the Special Servicer consent to the creation of any lien on a







 Mortgaged Property that is senior to, or on a parity with, the lien of the related Mortgage unless it is consistent with the Servicing Standard and the REMIC Provisions and the Special Servicer has received the consent of the Applicable Control Party.  Nothing in this Section 9.5 shall constitute a waiver of the Trustee's right, as the mortgagee of record, to receive notice of any assignment and assumption of a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan, any sale or other transfer of the related Mortgaged Property or the creation of any lien or other encumbrance with respect to such Mortgaged Property.



 (c)           Subject to the Servicing Standard and the rights and duties of the Master Servicer under Section 8.18, the Special Servicer may enter into any modification, waiver or amendment (including, without limitation, the substitution or release of collateral or the pledge of additional collateral) of the terms of any Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan, including any modification, waiver or amendment to (i) reduce the amounts owing under any Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan by forgiving principal, accrued interest and/or any Prepayment Premium, (ii) reduce the amount of the Scheduled Payment on any Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan, including by way of a reduction in the related Mortgage Rate, (iii) forbear in the enforcement of any right granted under any Mortgage Note or Mortgage relating to a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan, (iv) extend the Maturity Date of any Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan and/or (v) accept a principal prepayment on any Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan during any period during which voluntary Principal Prepayments are prohibited, provided, in the case of any such modification, waiver or amendment, that (A) the related Mortgagor is in default with respect to the Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan or, in the reasonable judgment of the Special Servicer, such default is reasonably foreseeable, (B) in the reasonable judgment of the Special Servicer, such modification, waiver or amendment would result in a recovery to Certificateholders, the holder of the related Serviced Companion Loan and the holder of the related B Note (as a collective whole) on a net present value basis (calculated in accordance with Section 1.2(e)) that would be equal to or greater than the recovery that would result if the applicable Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan was liquidated, as set forth in writing delivered by the Special Servicer to the Trustee and the Certificate Administrator, (C) such modification, waiver or amendment would not cause an Adverse REMIC Event or Adverse Grantor Trust Event (including with respect to any securities evidencing interests in any A Note or any B Note) to occur, and (D) if notice to, receipt of consent, approval or direction from, or consultation with the Controlling Class Representative (during any Subordinate Control Period and any Collective Consultation Period) or any related Loan-Specific Directing Holder (with respect to an A/B Whole Loan or a Loan Pair as to which the holder of the related B Note or Serviced Companion Loan, as applicable, or its designee is the related Loan-Specific Directing Holder), as applicable, is required in connection with such modification, waiver or amendment pursuant to Section 10.3 or any applicable Intercreditor Agreement, then the Special Servicer has made such notice, obtained (or been deemed to have obtained) such consent, approval or direction or completed such consultation, as the case may be.  The Special Servicer, with respect to any B Note and any Serviced Companion Loan that is a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan, shall notify the holder of the B Note and the Serviced Companion Loan, as applicable, of any modification of the monthly payments of an A/B Whole Loan or a Loan Pair, as the case may be, and such monthly payments shall be allocated in accordance with the related Intercreditor Agreement.



 In no event, however, shall the Special Servicer extend the Maturity Date of a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan beyond a date that is five (5) years prior to the Rated Final







 Distribution Date or (ii) if the Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan is secured by a ground lease, extend the Maturity Date of such Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan unless the Special Servicer gives due consideration to the remaining term of such ground lease.  The Special Servicer shall not extend the Maturity Date of any Mortgage Loan secured by a Mortgaged Property covered by a group secured creditor impaired property environmental insurance policy for more than five (5) years beyond such Mortgage Loan's Maturity Date unless a new Phase I Environmental Report indicates that there is no environmental condition or the Mortgagor obtains, at its expense, an extension of such policy on the same material terms and conditions to cover the period through five (5) years past the extended Maturity Date, provided that, if such Mortgage Loan is secured by a ground lease, the Special Servicer shall give due consideration to the remaining term of the ground lease.



 The determination of the Special Servicer contemplated by clause (B) of the proviso to the first (1st) paragraph of this Section 9.5(c) shall be evidenced by an Officer's Certificate certifying the information in the proviso to the first (1st) paragraph under this subsection (c).



 (d)           If the Special Servicer intends to permit a Mortgagor to substitute collateral for all or any portion of a Mortgaged Property pursuant to Section 9.5(c) or pledge additional collateral for the Mortgage Loan pursuant to Section 9.5(c), if the security interest of the Trust, the holder of any Serviced Companion Loan or the holder of any B Note in such collateral would be perfected by possession, or if such collateral requires special care or protection, then prior to agreeing to such substitution or addition of collateral, the Special Servicer shall make arrangements for such possession, care or protection, and prior to agreeing to such substitution or addition of collateral (or such arrangement for possession, care or protection) shall obtain the prior written consent of the Trustee with respect thereto (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned); provided, that the Trustee shall not be required (but has the option) to consent to any substitution or addition of collateral or to hold any such collateral which will require the Trustee to undertake any additional duties or obligations or incur any additional expense.  The Special Servicer shall provide each Rating Agency with a Rating Agency Communication in connection with any consent to the substitution of collateral for any portion of the Mortgaged Property pursuant to Section 9.5(c).



 (e)           The Special Servicer shall promptly deliver to the Master Servicer, the Controlling Class Representative (during any Subordinate Control Period and any Collective Consultation Period), the Trust Advisor (other than during any Subordinate Control Period), the Trustee, the Custodian, the Certificate Administrator and, subject to Section 5.7, the Rating Agencies (and, solely with respect to an A/B Whole Loan, the holder of the related B Note and solely with respect to a Loan Pair, the holder of the related Serviced Companion Loan) a notice, specifying any assignments and assumptions, modifications, waivers or amendments executed pursuant to this Section 9.5, such notice identifying the affected Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan.  Such notice shall set forth the reasons for such waiver, modification, or amendment (including, but not limited to, information such as related income and expense statements, rent rolls, occupancy status, property inspections, and an internal or external appraisal performed in accordance with MAI standards and methodologies (and, if done externally, the cost of such appraisal shall be recoverable as a Servicing Advance subject to the provisions of Section 4.4 hereof)).  The Special Servicer shall also deliver to the Custodian (on the Trustee's behalf), for







 deposit in the related Mortgage File, an original counterpart of the agreement relating to such modification, waiver or amendment promptly following the execution thereof.



 (f)           The Special Servicer may require, in its discretion (unless prohibited or otherwise provided in the related Mortgage Loan documents), as a condition to granting any request by a Mortgagor for any consent, modification, waiver or amendment, that such Mortgagor pay a reasonable and customary modification fee to the extent permitted by law.  No fee described in this Section shall be collected by the Special Servicer from the Mortgagor (or on behalf of the Mortgagor) in conjunction with any consent or any modification, waiver or amendment of the Mortgage Loan if the collection of such fee would cause such consent, modification, waiver or amendment to be a "significant modification" of the Mortgage Note within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.860G-2(b).  Subject to the foregoing, the Special Servicer shall use its reasonable efforts, in accordance with the Servicing Standard, to collect any modification fees and other expenses connected with a permitted modification of a Mortgage Loan from the Mortgagor.  The inability of the Mortgagor to pay any costs and expenses of a proposed modification shall not impair the right of the Special Servicer, the Master Servicer, the Custodian or the Trustee to be reimbursed by the Trust for such expenses (including any cost and expense associated any Opinion of Counsel).



 (g)           The Special Servicer shall cooperate with the Master Servicer (as provided in Section 8.7) in connection with assignments and assumptions of Mortgage Loans (other than any Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan) that are not Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans.



 (h)           If any Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan which contains a provision in the nature of a "due-on-encumbrance" clause, which by its terms:



 (i)           provides that such Mortgage Loan shall (or may at the mortgagee's option) become due and payable upon the creation of any additional lien or other encumbrance on the related Mortgaged Property or a lien on an ownership interest in the Mortgagor; or



 (ii)           requires the consent of the mortgagee to the creation of any such additional lien or other encumbrance on the related Mortgaged Property or a lien on an ownership interest in the Mortgagor,



 then, for so long as such Mortgage Loan is included in the Trust, the Special Servicer, on behalf of the Trustee as the mortgagee of record, shall exercise (or, subject to Section 10.3 and, in the case of any A/B Whole Loan or the related Loan Pair, the related Intercreditor Agreement, waive its right to exercise) any right it may have with respect to such Mortgage Loan (x) to accelerate the payments thereon, or (y) to withhold its consent to the creation of any such additional lien or other encumbrance, in a manner consistent with the Servicing Standard.  Prior to waiving the effect of such provision with respect to such Mortgage Loan, the Special Servicer shall provide each Rating Agency with a Rating Agency Communication regarding such waiver.



 Section 9.6     Release of Mortgage Files.



 (a)           Upon becoming aware of the payment in full of any Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan, or the receipt by the Special Servicer of a notification that payment in full will be escrowed in a manner customary for such purposes, or the complete defeasance of a Mortgage







 Loan, the Special Servicer will immediately notify the Master Servicer.  The Special Servicer shall determine, in accordance with the Servicing Standard, whether an instrument of satisfaction shall be delivered and, if the Special Servicer determines that such instrument should be delivered, the Special Servicer shall deliver written approval of such delivery to the Master Servicer.



 (b)           From time to time and as appropriate for the servicing or foreclosure of any Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan or the management of the related REO Property and in accordance with the Servicing Standard, the Trustee shall execute or cause to be executed such documents as shall be prepared and furnished to the Trustee by a Special Servicing Officer (in form reasonably acceptable to the Trustee) and as are necessary for such purposes.  The Custodian (on the Trustee's behalf) shall, upon request of the Special Servicer and delivery to the Trustee and Custodian of a request for release signed by a Special Servicing Officer substantially in the form of Exhibit C, release the related Mortgage File to the Special Servicer.



 (c)           The Special Servicer shall, with respect to any Rehabilitated Mortgage Loan, deliver to the Master Servicer copies of all documents and instruments in the possession of the Special Servicer related to such Rehabilitated Mortgage Loan.  Prior to the transfer of servicing with respect to any Rehabilitated Mortgage Loan to the Master Servicer in accordance with the Servicing Standard, the Special Servicer shall notify, in writing, the Mortgagor under such Rehabilitated Mortgage Loan of such transfer.



 (d)           With respect to any Non-Serviced Loan Combination, if pursuant to the related Intercreditor Agreement and the Other Pooling and Servicing Agreement, and as appropriate for enforcing the terms of such Non-Serviced Loan Combination, the related Other Master Servicer requests delivery to it of the original Mortgage Note, then the Custodian shall release or cause the release of such original Mortgage Note to the related Other Master Servicer or its designee and shall retain a copy thereof.



 Section 9.7     Documents, Records and Funds in Possession of Special Servicer To Be Held for the Trustee.



 (a)           The Special Servicer shall transmit to the Custodian (on the Trustee's behalf) such documents and instruments coming into the possession of the Special Servicer as from time to time are required by the terms hereof to be delivered to the Custodian (on the Trustee's behalf).  Any funds received by the Special Servicer in respect of any Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan or any REO Property or which otherwise are collected by the Special Servicer as Liquidation Proceeds, Condemnation Proceeds or Insurance Proceeds in respect of any Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan or any REO Property shall be transmitted to the Master Servicer within one (1) Business Day of receipt of properly identified funds for deposit into the Collection Account, except that if such amounts relate to REO Income, they shall be deposited in the REO Account.  Subject to the confidentiality provisions and restrictions on release of Privileged Information contained in this Agreement, the Special Servicer shall provide access to information and documentation regarding the Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans to the Trustee, the Custodian, the Master Servicer, the Certificate Administrator, the Controlling Class Representative (during any Subordinate Control Period and any Collective Consultation Period), the Trust Advisor (other than during any Subordinate Control Period), and their respective agents







 and accountants at any time upon reasonable written request and during normal business hours, provided that the Special Servicer shall not be required to take any action or provide any information that the Special Servicer determines will result in any material cost or expense to which it is not entitled to reimbursement hereunder or will result in any material liability for which it is not indemnified hereunder; provided, further, that the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator and the Custodian shall be entitled to receive from the Special Servicer all such information in the Special Servicer's possession as the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator and the Custodian shall reasonably require to perform their respective duties hereunder.  In fulfilling such a request, the Special Servicer shall not be responsible for determining whether such information is sufficient for the Trustee's, the Custodian's, the Master Servicer's, the Certificate Administrator's, the Controlling Class Representative's or the Trust Advisor's purposes.



 (b)           The Special Servicer hereby acknowledges that the Trust (and/or the holder of the related B Note, if an A/B Whole Loan is involved and/or the holder of the related Serviced Companion Loan, if a Loan Pair is involved) owns the Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans and all Mortgage Files representing such Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans and all funds now or hereafter held by, or under the control of, the Special Servicer that are collected by the Special Servicer in connection with the Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans (but excluding any Special Servicer Compensation and all other amounts to which the Special Servicer is entitled hereunder); and the Special Servicer agrees that all documents or instruments constituting part of the Mortgage Files, and such funds relating to the Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans which come into the possession or custody of, or which are subject to the control of, the Special Servicer, shall be held by the Special Servicer for and on behalf of the Trust (or the holder of the related B Note, if an A/B Whole Loan is involved or the holder of the related Serviced Companion Loan, if a Loan Pair is involved).



 (c)           The Special Servicer also agrees that it shall not create, incur or subject any Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans, or any funds that are required to be deposited in any REO Account to any claim, lien, security interest, judgment, levy, writ of attachment or other encumbrance, nor assert by legal action or otherwise any claim or right of setoff against any Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan or any funds, collected on, or in connection with, a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan.



 Section 9.8     Representations, Warranties and Covenants of the Special Servicer.



 (a)           The Special Servicer hereby represents and warrants to and covenants with the Trustee, the Custodian and the Certificate Administrator, as of the Closing Date:



 (i)           the Special Servicer is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing as a national banking association under the laws of the United States of America, and shall be and thereafter remain in compliance with the laws of each State in which any Mortgaged Property (including any REO Property) which is, or is related to, a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan is located to the extent necessary to perform its obligations under this Agreement, except where the failure to so qualify or comply would not adversely affect the Special Servicer's ability to perform its obligations hereunder in accordance with the terms of this Agreement;







  (ii)           the Special Servicer has the full power and authority to execute, deliver, perform, and to enter into and consummate all transactions and obligations contemplated by this Agreement.  The Special Servicer has duly and validly authorized the execution, delivery and performance by it of this Agreement and this Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Special Servicer; and this Agreement, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery thereof by the other parties to this Agreement, evidences the valid and binding obligation of the Special Servicer enforceable against the Special Servicer in accordance with its terms subject, as to enforcement of remedies, to applicable bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, conservatorship, moratorium, receivership and other similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally (and, to the extent applicable, the rights of creditors of national banks) as from time to time in effect, and to general principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law), and to matters of public policy with respect to indemnification or contribution as to violations of securities laws;



  (iii)          the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Special Servicer, the consummation by the Special Servicer of the transactions contemplated hereby, and the fulfillment of or compliance by the Special Servicer with the terms and conditions of this Agreement will not (1) conflict with, result in a breach, violation or acceleration of, or result in a default under, the terms of any other material agreement or instrument to which it is a party or by which it may be bound, or any law, governmental rule, regulation, or judgment, decree or order applicable to it of any court, regulatory body, administrative agency or governmental body having jurisdiction over it, in any manner that materially and adversely affects its ability to perform its obligations under this Agreement or (2) result in a breach of any term or provision of its organizational documents;



  (iv)          no litigation is pending or, to the best of the Special Servicer's knowledge, threatened, against it, the outcome of which, in the Special Servicer's reasonable judgment, could reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect the execution, delivery or enforceability of this Agreement or its ability to service the Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans or to perform any of its other obligations hereunder in accordance with the terms hereof;



  (v)           no consent, approval, authorization or order of any court or governmental agency or body is required for the execution, delivery and performance by it of, or compliance by it with, this Agreement, or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, or if any such consent, approval, authorization or order is required, it has obtained the same or will obtain the same prior to the time necessary to perform its obligations under this Agreement, and, except to the extent in the case of performance, that its failure to be qualified to do business or licensed in one or more states does not materially and adversely affect the performance by it of its obligations hereunder; and



  (vi)          the Special Servicer possesses all licenses, permits and other authorizations necessary to perform its duties hereunder in each state, except to the extent that being licensed or having permits or other authorization in one or more states is not necessary for the performance by it of its obligations hereunder.







  (b)           It is understood that the representations and warranties set forth in this Section 9.8 shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement.



  (c)           Any cause of action against the Special Servicer arising out of the breach of any representations and warranties made in this Section shall accrue upon the giving of written notice to the Special Servicer by any of the Trustee, the Custodian, the Master Servicer or the Certificate Administrator.  The Special Servicer shall give prompt notice to the Trustee, the Custodian, the Certificate Administrator, the Depositor, the Controlling Class Representative (during any Subordinate Control Period and any Collective Consultation Period), the Trust Advisor (other than during any Subordinate Control Period) and the Master Servicer of the occurrence, or the failure to occur, of any event that, with notice, or the passage of time or both, would cause any representation or warranty in this Section to be untrue or inaccurate in any respect.



 Section 9.9     Standard Hazard, Flood and Comprehensive General Liability Insurance Policies.



  (a)           For all REO Properties (other than REO Properties relating to Non-Serviced Mortgage Loans), the Special Servicer shall use reasonable efforts, consistent with the Servicing Standard, to maintain with a Qualified Insurer (A) a Standard Hazard Insurance Policy (that, if the terms of the related Mortgage Loan documents and the related Mortgage so require, contains no exclusion as to any Act or Acts of Terrorism, as defined in the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002) which does not provide for reduction due to depreciation in an amount which is not less than the full replacement cost of the improvements of such REO Property or in an amount not less than the Unpaid Principal Balance plus all unpaid interest and the cumulative amount of Servicing Advances (plus Advance Interest) made with respect to such Mortgage Loan, any related B Note and Serviced Companion Loan, whichever is less, but, in any event, in an amount sufficient to avoid the application of any co-insurance clause and (B) any other insurance coverage for such REO Property that the related Mortgagor was required to maintain for the related Mortgaged Property under the related Mortgage, subject, as to earthquake insurance, to the second (2nd) sentence following this sentence.  If the improvements to the Mortgaged Property are in an area identified in the Federal Register by the Federal Emergency Management Agency as having special flood hazards (and flood insurance has been made available), the Special Servicer shall maintain a flood insurance policy meeting the requirements of the current guidelines of the Federal Insurance Administration in an amount representing coverage equal to the lesser of the then Unpaid Principal Balance of the Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan and unpaid Advances (plus Advance Interest) and the maximum insurance coverage required under such current guidelines.  It is understood and agreed that the Special Servicer has no obligation to obtain earthquake or other additional insurance on REO Property, except as required by law but at its sole option and at the Trust's expense, it (if required at origination and is available at commercially reasonable rates) may obtain such earthquake insurance.  The Special Servicer shall use its reasonable efforts, consistent with the Servicing Standard, to obtain a comprehensive general liability insurance policy for all REO Properties (other than any REO Property relating to any Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan).  The Special Servicer shall, to the extent available at commercially reasonable rates (as determined by the Special Servicer in accordance with the Servicing Standard) and to the extent consistent with the Servicing Standard, use its reasonable efforts to maintain a Rent Loss Policy covering revenues







  for a period of at least twelve months and a comprehensive general liability policy with coverage comparable to prudent lending requirements in an amount not less than $1 million per occurrence.  All applicable policies required to be maintained by the Special Servicer pursuant to this Section 9.9(a) shall name the Trustee as loss payee and be endorsed with a standard mortgagee clause.  The costs of such insurance shall be a Servicing Advance, subject to the provisions of Section 4.4 hereof.



  (b)           Any amounts collected by the Special Servicer under any insurance policies maintained pursuant to this Section 9.9 (other than amounts to be applied to the restoration or repair of the REO Property) shall be deposited into the applicable REO Account for further distribution to the Master Servicer pursuant to Section 9.10.  Any cost incurred in maintaining the insurance required hereby for any REO Property (other than any REO Property relating to any Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan) shall be a Servicing Advance, subject to the provisions of Section 4.4 hereof.



  (c)           Notwithstanding the above, the Special Servicer shall not be required in any event to maintain or obtain insurance coverage beyond what is available at commercially reasonable rates; provided that, subject to Section 10.3, and the terms and conditions of any related Intercreditor Agreement, the Special Servicer shall maintain insurance against property damages resulting from terrorism or similar acts if the terms of the related Mortgage Loan documents so require unless the Special Servicer determines that the failure to maintain such insurance would have been an Acceptable Insurance Default under the related Mortgage Loan.



  (d)           The Special Servicer shall conclusively be deemed to have satisfied its obligations as set forth in this Section 9.9 either (i) if the Special Servicer shall have obtained and maintained a master force placed or blanket insurance policy insuring against hazard losses on all of the applicable Mortgage Loans, any Serviced Companion Loan and any B Note serviced by it, it being understood and agreed that such policy may contain a deductible clause on terms substantially equivalent to those commercially available and maintained by comparable servicers consistent with the Servicing Standard, and provided that such policy is issued by a Qualified Insurer with a minimum claims paying ability rating of at least ''A-'' by Fitch and at least "A3" by Moody's or, if not rated by either or both of Fitch or Moody's, then its equivalent by at least one (1) Other NRSRO for each Rating Agency that has not so assigned a rating or (ii) if the Special Servicer, for so long as the rating of such Person's long-term debt is not less than ''A'' as rated by Fitch and not less than "A3" as rated by Moody's, self-insures for its obligations as set forth in the first (1st) paragraph of this Section 9.9.  If the Special Servicer shall cause any Mortgage Loan, Serviced Companion Loan and B Note to be covered by such a master force placed or blanket insurance policy, the incremental cost of such insurance allocable to such Mortgage Loan, Serviced Companion Loan and B Note (ixxPDexxPD, other than any minimum or standby premium payable for such policy whether or not any Mortgage Loan is then covered thereby), if not borne by the related Mortgagor, shall be paid by the Special Servicer, at its option, or by the Master Servicer, in either case as a Servicing Advance, subject to the provisions of Section 4.4 hereof.  If such policy contains a deductible clause, the Special Servicer shall, if there shall not have been maintained on the related Mortgaged Property a policy complying with this Section 9.9 and there shall have been a loss that would have been covered by such policy, deposit in the Collection Account the amount not otherwise payable under such master force placed or blanket insurance policy because of such deductible clause to the extent that such







 deductible exceeds (i) the deductible under the related Mortgage Loan, A/B Whole Loan or Serviced Companion Loan or (ii) if there is no deductible limitation required under the Mortgage Loan, A/B Whole Loan or Serviced Companion Loan, the deductible amount with respect to insurance policies generally available on properties similar to the related Mortgaged Property which is consistent with the Servicing Standard, and deliver to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate describing the calculation of such amount.  In connection with its activities as administrator and servicer of the Mortgage Loans, any Serviced Companion Loan and any B Note, the Special Servicer agrees to present, on its behalf and on behalf of the Trustee, claims under any such master force placed or blanket insurance policy.



 Section 9.10      Presentment of Claims and Collection of Proceeds.  The Special Servicer will prepare and present or cause to be prepared and presented on behalf of the Trustee all claims under the Insurance Policies with respect to REO Property (other than any REO Property relating to any Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan), and take such actions (including the negotiation, settlement, compromise or enforcement of the insured's claim) as shall be necessary to recover under such policies.  Any proceeds disbursed to the Special Servicer in respect of such policies shall be promptly remitted to the Master Servicer for deposit into the Collection Account, upon receipt of properly identified funds, except for any amounts realized that are to be applied to the repair or restoration of the applicable REO Property in accordance with the Servicing Standard.  Any extraordinary expenses (but not ordinary and routine or anticipated expenses) incurred by the Special Servicer in fulfilling its obligations under this Section 9.10 shall be paid by the Trust.



 Section 9.11     Compensation to the Special Servicer.



  (a)           As compensation for its activities hereunder, the Special Servicer shall be entitled to (i) the Special Servicing Fee, (ii) the Liquidation Fee and (iii) the Workout Fee.  Such amounts, if any, collected by the Special Servicer from the related Mortgagor shall be transferred by the Special Servicer to the Master Servicer within one (1) Business Day of receipt thereof, and deposited by the Master Servicer in the Collection Account.  The Special Servicer shall be entitled to receive a Liquidation Fee from the Liquidation Proceeds received in connection with a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan or REO Property.  With respect to each REO Mortgage Loan that is a successor to a Mortgage Loan secured by two or more Mortgaged Properties, the reference to "REO Property" in the preceding sentence shall be construed on a property-by-property basis to refer separately to the acquired real property that is a successor to each of such Mortgaged Properties, thereby entitling the Special Servicer to a Liquidation Fee from the Liquidation Proceeds received in connection with a final disposition of, and Condemnation Proceeds received in connection with, each such acquired property as the Liquidation Proceeds related to that property are received.  The Special Servicer shall also be entitled to additional special servicing compensation of an amount equal to the excess, if any, of the aggregate Prepayment Interest Excess relating to Mortgage Loans which are Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans that have, during any Collection Period, been the subject of voluntary Principal Prepayments not from Liquidation Proceeds or from modifications of Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans for each Distribution Date over the aggregate Prepayment Interest Shortfalls incurred with respect to such Mortgage Loans during the same Collection Period.  If the Special Servicer is terminated or resigns, the Special Servicer shall retain the right (and the applicable successor Special Servicer shall not have the right) to receive (until the related Mortgage Loan







 becomes a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan or until the related Mortgaged Property becomes an REO Property) any and all Workout Fees payable in respect of (i) any Mortgage Loans serviced by the Special Servicer that became Rehabilitated Mortgage Loans during the period that it acted as Special Servicer and that were still Rehabilitated Mortgage Loans at the time of such termination or resignation and (ii) any Mortgage Loans that constitute Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans for which the Special Servicer has resolved the circumstances and/or conditions causing any such Mortgage Loan to be a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan such that the Mortgage Loan would be deemed a Rehabilitated Mortgage Loan but for the related Mortgagor having not yet made, as of the date of such termination or resignation, three (3) timely Scheduled Payments required by the terms of the workout; provided that in either case no other event has occurred as of the time of the Special Servicer's termination or resignation that would otherwise cause such Mortgage Loan to again become a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan.



  (b)           The Special Servicer shall be entitled to cause the Master Servicer to withdraw (i) from the Collection Account, the Special Servicer Compensation in respect of each Mortgage Loan (but not a B Note), (ii) from any Serviced Companion Loan Custodial Account, the Special Servicer Compensation to the extent related solely to the related Serviced Companion Loan and (iii) from any A/B Whole Loan Custodial Account, the Special Servicer Compensation to the extent related solely to the related B Note, in the time and manner set forth in Section 5.2 of this Agreement.  The Special Servicer shall be required to pay all expenses incurred by it in connection with its servicing activities hereunder and shall not be entitled to reimbursement therefor except as expressly provided in this Agreement.



  (c)            Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary (and, in the case of any A/B Whole Loan, Loan Pair or Non-Serviced Loan Combination, subject to any provisions of the applicable Intercreditor Agreement relating to the allocation of the amounts set forth below), the Special Servicer shall be entitled to receive the following items as additional special servicing compensation:



   (i)             (x) 100% of Unallocable Modification Fees actually collected during the related Collection Period with respect to any Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans or REO Mortgage Loans (other than any REO Mortgage Loan that was a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan); and (y) 50% of Unallocable Modification Fees collected during the related Collection Period with respect to Mortgage Loans and Serviced Companion Loans that are not Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans in connection with a consent, approval or other action that the Master Servicer is not permitted to take in the absence of the consent or approval (or deemed consent or approval) of the Special Servicer under the other provisions of this Agreement;



   (ii)           After application as set forth in Section 5.2(b) hereof, (x) 100% of Allocable Modification Fees (that constitute Excess Modification Fees) actually collected during the related Collection Period with respect to any Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans or REO Mortgage Loans (other than any REO Mortgage Loan that was a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan); and (y) 50% of Allocable Modification Fees (that constitute Excess Modification Fees) collected during the related Collection Period with respect to Mortgage Loans and Serviced Companion Loans that are not Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans in connection with a consent, approval or other action that the Master Servicer is not permitted to take in the absence of the consent or







 approval (or deemed consent or approval) of the Special Servicer under the other provisions of this Agreement;



  (iii)          100% of Assumption Fees collected during the related Collection Period with respect to Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans, and 50% of Assumption Fees collected during the related Collection Period with respect to Mortgage Loans and Serviced Companion Loans that are not Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans in connection with a consent, approval or other action that the Master Servicer is not permitted to take in the absence of the consent or approval (or deemed consent or approval) of the Special Servicer under the other provisions of this Agreement;



  (iv)          100% of assumption application fees collected during the related Collection Period with respect to Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans;



  (v)           100% of Consent Fees on Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans in connection with a consent that involves no modification, assumption, extension, waiver or amendment of the terms of any Mortgage Loan documents, and 50% of Consent Fees on Mortgage Loans and Serviced Companion Loans that are not Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans in connection with a consent that involves no modification, assumption, extension, waiver or amendment of the terms of any Mortgage Loan documents and is paid in connection with a consent that the Master Servicer is not permitted to take in the absence of the consent or approval (or deemed consent or approval) of the Special Servicer under the other provisions of this Agreement;



  (vi)          100% of charges for beneficiary statements or demands actually paid by the Mortgagors under the Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans;



  (vii)         50% of other loan processing fees actually paid by the Mortgagors under the Mortgage Loans and Serviced Companion Loans that are not Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans to the extent that the consent of the Special Servicer is required in connection with the associated action, and (b) 100% of other loan processing fees actually paid by the Mortgagors under the Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans;



  (viii)         Interest or other income earned during any Collection Period on deposits in any REO Account maintained by the Special Servicer, in accordance with Section 9.14 (net of investment losses with respect to such REO Account for such Collection Period); and



  (ix)           After application as set forth in Section 5.2(b), any Excess Penalty Charges earned on the Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans.



  (d)          The Special Servicer and its Affiliates shall be prohibited from receiving or retaining any compensation or any other remuneration (including, without limitation, in the form of commissions, brokerage fees, rebates, or as a result of any other fee-sharing arrangement) from any Person (including, without limitation, the Trust, any Borrower, any Manager, any guarantor or indemnitor in respect of a Mortgage Loan, Loan Pair or A/B Whole Loan and any purchaser of any Mortgage Loan, Loan Pair, A/B Whole Loan or REO Property) in connection with the disposition, workout or foreclosure of any Mortgage Loan (or Loan Pair or







 A/B Whole Loan, if applicable), the management or disposition of any REO Property, or the performance of any other special servicing duties under this Agreement, other than as expressly provided in this Section 9.11; provided, that such prohibition shall not apply to Permitted Special Servicer/Affiliate Fees.



 Section 9.12       Realization Upon Defaulted Mortgage Loans.



  (a)           The Special Servicer, in accordance with the Servicing Standard and subject to Section 9.3(a), Section 9.12(b), Section 9.12(c), Section 9.12(e), Section 9.17 and Section 10.3 and the terms and conditions of any related Intercreditor Agreement, shall use its reasonable efforts to foreclose upon, repossess or otherwise comparably convert the ownership of Mortgaged Properties securing such of the Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans as come into and continue in default and as to which no satisfactory arrangements can be made for collection of delinquent payments of such Mortgage Loan, the sale of such Mortgage Loan in accordance with this Agreement or the modification of such Mortgage Loan in accordance with this Agreement.  In connection with such foreclosure or other conversion of ownership, the Special Servicer shall follow the Servicing Standard.  The foregoing is subject to the proviso that the Special Servicer shall not request that the Master Servicer make a Servicing Advance for Liquidation Expenses that would be a Nonrecoverable Advance unless the Special Servicer determines that such Servicing Advance is in the best interest of the Certificateholders (and in the case of any A/B Whole Loan, the holder of the related B Note and the Trust as a collective whole and in the case of any Loan Pair, the holder of the related Serviced Companion Loan and the Trust as a collective whole).



  (b)           The Special Servicer shall not acquire any personal property relating to any Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan pursuant hereto unless:



  (i)           such personal property is incidental to real property (within the meaning of Section 856(e)(1) of the Code) so acquired by the Special Servicer;



  (ii)          such personal property is the capital stock of a settlor and both (A) the Special Servicer takes such action as may be necessary in order to treat the settlor as an entity that is disregarded as an entity separate from a REMIC Pool under Treasury Regulation Section 301.7701-3 (including by filing an election under such regulation and by creating a wholly-owned LLC of the REMIC for the purpose of acquiring part of such capital stock) and (B) the property owned by such settlor at the time the capital stock is acquired consists solely of "foreclosure property" under the REMIC Provisions; or



  (iii)         the Special Servicer shall have received a Nondisqualification Opinion (the cost of which shall be reimbursed by the Trust) to the effect that the holding of such personal property by any REMIC Pool will not cause the imposition of a tax on any REMIC Pool under the Code or cause any REMIC Pool to fail to qualify as a REMIC.



  (c)           Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Special Servicer shall not, on behalf of the Trust, obtain title to a Mortgaged Property as a result of or in lieu of foreclosure or otherwise, and shall not otherwise acquire possession of, or take any other action with respect to, any Mortgaged Property, if, as a result of any such action the Trust, or any







 trust that holds a B Note or Serviced Companion Loan would be considered to hold title to, to be a "mortgagee-in-possession" of, or to be an "owner" or "operator" of such Mortgaged Property within the meaning of CERCLA, or any applicable comparable federal, state or local law, or a "discharger" or "responsible party" thereunder, unless, subject to Section 10.3 and the terms and conditions of any related Intercreditor Agreement, the Special Servicer has also previously determined in accordance with the Servicing Standard, based on a Phase I Environmental Report prepared by a Person (who may be an employee or affiliate of the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer) who regularly conducts environmental site assessments in accordance with the standards of Fannie Mae in the case of multi-family mortgage loans and customary servicing practices in the case of commercial loans for environmental assessments, which report shall be delivered to the Trustee, the Custodian, the Certificate Administrator and the 17g-5 Information Provider, that:



  (i)           such Mortgaged Property is in compliance with applicable Environmental Laws or, if not, after consultation with an environmental expert, that taking such actions as are necessary to bring the Mortgaged Property in compliance therewith is reasonably likely to produce a greater recovery on a net present value basis (calculated in accordance with Section 1.2(e)) than not taking such actions;



  (ii)          taking such actions as are necessary to bring the Mortgaged Property in compliance with applicable Environmental Laws is reasonably likely to produce a greater recovery on a net present value basis (calculated in accordance with Section 1.2(e)) than pursuing a claim under the Environmental Insurance Policy; and



  (iii)         there are no circumstances or conditions present or threatened at such Mortgaged Property relating to the use, management, disposal or release of any hazardous substances, hazardous materials, hazardous wastes, or petroleum-based materials for which investigation, testing, monitoring, removal, clean-up or remediation could be required under any federal, state or local law or regulation, or that, if any such materials are present for which such action could be required, after consultation with an environmental expert, that taking such actions with respect to the affected Mortgaged Property is reasonably likely to produce a greater recovery on a net present value basis (calculated in accordance with Section 1.2(e)) than not taking such actions (after taking into account the projected costs of such actions);



 provided that such compliance pursuant to clause (i) and (ii) above or the taking of such action pursuant to this clause (iii) shall only be required to the extent that the cost thereof is a Servicing Advance of the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer pursuant to this Agreement, subject to the provisions of Section 4.4 hereof.



  (d)           The cost of the Phase I Environmental Report contemplated by Section 9.12(c) may be treated as a Liquidation Expense, or in the event the related Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan is not liquidated and a Final Recovery Determination has been made with respect to such Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan, the Master Servicer shall treat such cost as a Servicing Advance subject to the provisions of Section 4.4 hereof; provided that, in the latter event, the Special Servicer shall use its good faith reasonable business efforts to recover such cost from the Mortgagor in connection with the curing of the default under the Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan.







  (e)           If the Special Servicer determines, pursuant to Section 9.12(c), and subject to Section 10.3 and the terms and conditions of any related Intercreditor Agreement, that taking such actions as are necessary to bring any Mortgaged Property into compliance with applicable Environmental Laws, or taking such actions with respect to the containment, removal, clean-up or remediation of hazardous substances, hazardous materials, hazardous wastes, or petroleum-based materials affecting any such Mortgaged Property, is not reasonably likely to produce a greater recovery on a net present value basis (calculated in accordance with Section 1.2(e)) than not taking such actions (after taking into account the projected costs of such actions) or than not pursuing a claim under the Environmental Insurance Policy, then the Special Servicer shall take such action as it deems to be in the best economic interest of the Trust (and the holder of the related B Note if in connection with an A/B Whole Loan and the holder of the related Serviced Companion Loan if in connection with a Loan Pair, taken as a collective whole), including, without limitation, releasing the lien of the related Mortgage, and the Special Servicer shall provide written notice of such circumstances to the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator (who shall promptly post such written notice on the Certificate Administrator's Website pursuant to Section 5.4) and the 17g-5 Information Provider (who shall promptly post such written notice on the 17g-5 Information Provider's Website pursuant to Section 5.7).  In connection with the foregoing, if the Special Servicer determines that a material possibility exists that Liquidation Expenses with respect to Mortgaged Property (taking into account the cost of bringing it into compliance with applicable Environmental Laws) would exceed the Unpaid Principal Balance of the related Mortgage Loan, the Special Servicer shall provide written notice of such circumstances to the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator (who shall promptly post such written notice on the Certificate Administrator's Website pursuant to Section 5.4) and the 17g-5 Information Provider (who shall promptly post such written notice on the 17g-5 Information Provider's Website pursuant to Section 5.7).



  (f)           Subject to Section 10.3 and the terms and conditions of any related Intercreditor Agreement, the Special Servicer shall have the right to determine, in accordance with the Servicing Standard, the advisability of maintaining any action with respect to any Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan, including, without limitation, any action to obtain a deficiency judgment with respect to any Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan.



 Section 9.13      Foreclosure.  If the Trust obtains, through foreclosure on a Mortgage or otherwise, the right to receive title to a Mortgaged Property (other than any Mortgaged Property relating to any Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan), the Special Servicer, as its agent, shall direct the appropriate party to deliver title to the related REO Property to the Trustee or its nominee.



 The Special Servicer may consult with counsel to determine when an Acquisition Date shall be deemed to occur under the REMIC Provisions with respect to the Mortgaged Property, the expense of such consultation being treated as a Servicing Advance related to the foreclosure, subject to the provisions of Section 4.4 hereof.  The Special Servicer, on behalf of the Trust (and the holder of the related B Note if in connection with an A/B Whole Loan and the holder of the related Serviced Companion Loan if in connection with a Loan Pair), shall sell such REO Property expeditiously, but in any event within the time period, and subject to the conditions, set forth in Section 9.15.  Subject to Section 9.15, the Special Servicer shall manage, conserve, protect and operate such REO Property for the holders of beneficial interests in the







 Trust (and the holder of the related B Note if in connection with an A/B Whole Loan and the holder of the related Serviced Companion Loan if in connection with a Loan Pair) solely for the purpose of its prompt disposition and sale.



  In connection with causing the Trust to foreclose on collateral that consists of multiple properties held for sale to customers by the Mortgagor (such as unsold condominium units in a single project), the Special Servicer shall consider the effect of the bidding price for the properties on the tax basis of such properties if such properties are likely to be treated in the hands of the Trust as properties held for sale to customers.



 Section 9.14     Operation of REO Property.



  (a)           The Special Servicer shall segregate and hold all funds collected and received in connection with the operation of each REO Property separate and apart from its own funds and general assets and shall establish and maintain with respect to each REO Property one or more accounts held in trust for the benefit of the Certificateholders (and the holder of the related B Note if in connection with an A/B Whole Loan and the holder of the related Serviced Companion Loan if in connection with a Loan Pair) in the name of Midland Loan Services, a Division of PNC Bank, National Association, as Special Servicer on behalf of UxxPDSxxPD Bank National Association, as Trustee for the benefit of the Holders of Morgan Stanley Bank of America Merrill Lynch Trust 2013-C12, Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2013-C12, the holder of any Serviced Companion Loan and the holder of any B Note as their interests may appear (each, an "REO Account"), which shall be an Eligible Account.  The Special Servicer shall deposit all funds received with respect to an REO Property in the applicable REO Account within two (2) days of receipt of properly identified funds.  The Special Servicer shall account separately for funds received or expended with respect to each REO Property.  All funds in each REO Account may be invested only in Eligible Investments at the risk of the Special Servicer.  The Special Servicer shall notify the Trustee and the Master Servicer in writing of the location and account number of each REO Account and shall notify the Trustee prior to any subsequent change thereof.



  (b)           On or before each Special Servicer Remittance Date, the Special Servicer shall withdraw from each REO Account and remit to the Master Servicer for deposit into the Collection Account, the REO Income received or collected during the Collection Period immediately preceding such Special Servicer Remittance Date on or with respect to the related REO Properties; provided that (i) the Special Servicer may retain in such REO Account such portion of such proceeds and collections as may be necessary to maintain in the REO Account sufficient funds for the proper operation, management and maintenance of the related REO Property, including, without limitation, the creation of reasonable reserves for repairs, replacements, and necessary capital improvements and other related expenses.  The Special Servicer shall notify the Master Servicer of all such remittances (and the REO Properties to which the deposits relate) made into the Collection Account and (ii) the Special Servicer shall be entitled to withdraw from the REO Account and pay itself as additional Special Servicing Compensation any interest or net reinvestment income earned on funds deposited in the REO Account.  The amount of any losses incurred in respect of any such investments shall be for the account of the Special Servicer which shall deposit the amount of such loss (to the extent not offset by income from other investments) in the REO Account, out of its own funds immediately







 as realized; provided that, such investment losses shall not include any loss with respect to such investment which is incurred solely as a result of the insolvency of the federal or state chartered depositary institution or trust company at which such Investment Account is maintained, so long as such depositary institution or trust company (a) satisfied the qualifications set forth in the definition of "Eligible Account" both at the time such investment was made and as of a date not more than thirty (30) days prior to the date of such loss and (b) is not the Person that made the relevant investment.  If the Special Servicer deposits in any REO Account any amount not required to be deposited therein, it may at any time withdraw such amount from the REO Account, any provision herein to the contrary notwithstanding.



  (c)           If the Trust acquires the Mortgaged Property, the Special Servicer shall have full power and authority, subject to Section 10.3 and the terms and conditions of any related Intercreditor Agreement, to do any and all things in connection therewith as are consistent with the Servicing Standard, subject to the REMIC Provisions, and in such manner as the Special Servicer deems to be in the best interest of the Trust (and in the case of any A/B Whole Loan, the holder of the related B Note and the Trust as a collective whole, and in the case of any Loan Pair, the holder of the related Serviced Companion Loan and the Trust as a collective whole), and, consistent therewith, may advance from its own funds to pay for the following items (which amounts shall be reimbursed by the Master Servicer or the Trust subject to Sections 4.4 in accordance with Section 4.6(e)), to the extent such amounts cannot be paid from REO Income:



  (i)             all insurance premiums due and payable in respect of such REO Property;



  (ii)           all real estate taxes and assessments in respect of such REO Property that could result or have resulted in the imposition of a lien thereon; and



  (iii)           all costs and expenses necessary to maintain, operate, lease and sell such REO Property (other than capital improvements and, to the extent necessary to comply with the REMIC Provisions, capital expenditures).



  (d)           The Special Servicer may, and to the extent necessary to (i) preserve the status of the REO Property as "foreclosure property" under the REMIC Provisions or (ii) avoid the imposition of a tax on "income from nonpermitted assets" within the meaning of the REMIC Provisions, shall contract with any Independent Contractor for the operation and management of the REO Property, provided that:



  (i)            the terms and conditions of any such contract shall not be inconsistent herewith;



  (ii)           the terms of such contract shall be consistent with the provisions of Section 856 of the Code and Treasury Regulation Section 1.856-4(b)(5);



  (iii)           only to the extent consistent with (ii) above, any such contract shall require, or shall be administered to require, that the Independent Contractor (A) pay all costs and expenses incurred in connection with the operation and management of such Mortgaged Property underlying the REO Property and (B) deposit on a daily basis all amounts payable to the Trust in







 accordance with the contract between the Trust and the Independent Contractor in an Eligible Account;



  (iv)           none of the provisions of this Section 9.14 relating to any such contract or to actions taken through any such Independent Contractor shall be deemed to relieve the Special Servicer of any of its duties and obligations to the Trustee with respect to the operation and management of any such REO Property;



  (v)            if the Independent Contractor is an Affiliate of the Special Servicer, the consent of the Applicable Control Party, and a Nondisqualification Opinion, must be obtained; and



  (vi)           the Special Servicer shall be obligated with respect thereto to the same extent as if it alone were performing all duties and obligations in connection with the operation and management of such REO Property.



  The Special Servicer shall be entitled to enter into any agreement with any Independent Contractor performing services for the Trust (and, if applicable, the holder of a B Note or a Serviced Companion Loan) pursuant to this subsection (d) for indemnification of the Special Servicer by such Independent Contractor, and nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to limit or modify such indemnification.  All fees of the Independent Contractor (other than fees paid for performing services within the ordinary duties of a Special Servicer which shall be paid by the Special Servicer) shall be paid from the income derived from the REO Property (or if not available from amounts on deposit in the related REO Account, shall be an Additional Trust Expense).  To the extent that the income from the REO Property is insufficient, such fees shall be advanced by the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer as a Servicing Advance, subject to the provisions of Section 4.4 and Section 4.6(e) hereof.



  (e)           Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Special Servicer shall not rent, lease, or otherwise earn income on behalf of the Trust or the beneficial owners thereof with respect to REO Property which might cause the REO Property to fail to qualify as "foreclosure property" within the meaning of Section 860G(a)(8) of the Code (without giving effect to the final sentence thereof) or result in the receipt by any REMIC of any "income from nonpermitted assets" within the meaning of Section 860F(a)(2) of the Code or any "net income from foreclosure property" which is subject to tax under the REMIC Provisions unless (i) the Trustee and the Special Servicer have received an Opinion of Counsel (at the Trust's sole expense) to the effect that, under the REMIC Provisions and any relevant proposed legislation, any income generated for REMIC I by the REO Property would not result in the imposition of a tax upon REMIC I or (ii) in accordance with the Servicing Standard, the Special Servicer determines the income or earnings with respect to such REO Property will offset any tax under the REMIC Provisions relating to such income or earnings and will maximize the net recovery from the REO Property to the Certificateholders.  The Special Servicer shall notify the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator and the Master Servicer of any election by it to incur such tax, and the Special Servicer (i) shall hold in escrow in an Eligible Account an amount equal to the tax payable thereby from revenues collected from the related REO Property, (ii) provide the Certificate Administrator with all information for the Certificate Administrator to file the necessary tax returns in connection therewith and (iii) upon request from the Certificate







  Administrator, pay from such account to the Certificate Administrator the amount of the applicable tax.  The Certificate Administrator shall file the applicable tax returns based on the information supplied by the Special Servicer and pay the applicable tax from the amounts collected by the Special Servicer.



 Subject to, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Special Servicer, on behalf of the Trust, shall not:



  (i)             permit the Trust to enter into, renew or extend any New Lease with respect to the REO Property, if the New Lease by its terms will give rise to any income that does not constitute Rents from Real Property;



  (ii)           permit any amount to be received or accrued under any New Lease other than amounts that will constitute Rents from Real Property;



  (iii)           authorize or permit any construction on the REO Property, other than the completion of a building or other improvement thereon, and then only if more than ten (10) percent of the construction of such building or other improvement was completed before default on the Mortgage Loan became imminent, all within the meaning of Section 856(e)(4)(B) of the Code; or



  (iv)           Directly Operate, other than through an Independent Contractor, or allow any other Person to Directly Operate, other than through an Independent Contractor, the REO Property on any date more than ninety (90) days after the Acquisition Date; unless, in any such case, the Special Servicer has requested and received an Opinion of Counsel at the Trust's sole expense to the effect that such action will not cause such REO Property to fail to qualify as "foreclosure property" within the meaning of Section 860G(a)(8) of the Code (without giving effect to the final sentence thereof) at any time that it is held by the applicable REMIC Pool, in which case the Special Servicer may take such actions as are specified in such Opinion of Counsel.



  (f)           Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Special Servicer shall not have any obligations with respect to an REO Property that relates to a Mortgaged Property that secures a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan and all references to the Special Servicer's obligations in this Agreement with respect to "REO Property" shall exclude any such Mortgaged Property that secures a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan.



 Section 9.15      Sale of REO Property.



  (a)           If title to any REO Property is acquired by the Trust (or its nominee) in respect of any Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan, the deed or certificate of sale shall be issued to the Trust, the Trustee or to its nominees.  The Special Servicer, subject to Section 10.3 and the terms and conditions of any related Intercreditor Agreement, shall use its reasonable best efforts to sell any REO Property for cash as soon as practicable consistent with the objective of maximizing proceeds for all Certificateholders (and, with respect to a Loan Pair or A/B Whole Loan, for the Certificateholders and the holder of the related Serviced Companion Loan or B Note, as applicable, as a collective whole), but in no event later than the end of the third (3rd) calendar year following the end of the year of its acquisition, and in any event prior to the Rated







 Final Distribution Date or earlier to the extent necessary to comply with REMIC Provisions, unless (i) the Trustee or the Special Servicer, on behalf of the applicable REMIC Pool, (A) has been granted an extension of time (an "Extension") (which extension shall be applied for at least sixty (60) days prior to the expiration of the period specified above) by the IRS for the orderly liquidation of such REO Property (a copy of which Extension and the related application shall be delivered to the Certificate Administrator upon request), or (B) is permitted under the REMIC Provisions to continue to hold such REO Property during the period in which the application for such an Extension is pending, in either of which cases the Special Servicer may continue to attempt to sell the REO Property for cash for its fair market value for such longer period as such Extension permits or while the application for such Extension is pending, as the case may be, or (ii) the Special Servicer seeks and subsequently receives, at the expense of the Trust, a Nondisqualification Opinion, addressed to the Trustee and the Special Servicer, to the effect that the holding by the Trust of such REO Property subsequent to the period specified above after its acquisition will not result in the imposition of taxes on "prohibited transactions" of a REMIC, as defined in Section 860F(a)(2) of the Code, or cause any REMIC Pool to fail to qualify as a REMIC at any time that any Certificates are outstanding; provided that in no event shall the Trust be permitted to hold any REO Property beyond the end of the sixth (6th) calendar year following the end of the year of such REO Property's acquisition.   If the Trustee has not received such an Extension or Opinion of Counsel and the Special Servicer is not able to sell such REO Property for cash within the period specified above, or if an Extension has been granted and the Special Servicer is unable to sell such REO Property within the extended time period, the Special Servicer shall, after consultation with the Applicable Control Party, before the end of such period or extended period, as the case may be, auction the REO Property to the highest cash bidder (which may be the Special Servicer or another Interested Person) in accordance with the Servicing Standard; provided, that if the Special Servicer, any other Interested Person or any of their respective affiliated entities intends to bid on or otherwise purchase any REO Property, (i) the Special Servicer shall notify the Trustee of such intent, (ii) the Trustee shall promptly obtain, at the expense of the Trust, an Appraisal of such REO Property (or internal valuation in accordance with the procedures specified in Section 6.9) and (iii) the applicable Interested Person shall not bid less than the fair market value set forth in such Appraisal.  Neither the Trustee nor any Affiliate thereof may purchase an REO Property.



  (b)           Within thirty (30) days of the sale of the REO Property, the Special Servicer shall provide to the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator, the Custodian, the 17g-5 Information Provider, the Trust Advisor (during any Collective Consultation Period and any Senior Consultation Period), the Controlling Class Representative (during any Subordinate Control Period and any Collective Consultation Period) and the Master Servicer (and the holder of the related B Note, if any, if in connection with an A/B Whole Loan and the holder of the related Serviced Companion Loan, if in connection with a Loan Pair) a statement of accounting for such REO Property, including without limitation, (i) the Acquisition Date for the REO Property, (ii) the date of disposition of the REO Property, (iii) the sale price and related selling and other expenses, (iv) accrued interest (including interest deemed to have accrued) on the Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan to which the REO Property related, calculated from the Acquisition Date to the disposition date, (v) final property operating statements, and (vi) such other information as the Trustee or the Certificate Administrator (and the holder of the related B Note, if any, if in connection with an A/B Whole Loan and the holder of the related Serviced Companion Loan, if in connection with a Loan Pair) may reasonably request in writing.







  (c)           The Liquidation Proceeds from the final disposition of the REO Property shall be remitted to the Master Servicer for deposit into the Collection Account within one (1) Business Day of receipt.



  (d)           Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Special Servicer shall not have any obligations with respect to an REO Property that relates to a Mortgaged Property that secures a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan and all references to the Special Servicer's obligations in this Agreement with respect to "REO Property" shall exclude any such Mortgaged Property that secures a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan.



 Section 9.16      Realization on Collateral Security.  In connection with the enforcement of the rights of the Trust to any property securing any Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan other than the related Mortgaged Property, the Special Servicer shall consult with counsel to determine how best to enforce such rights in a manner consistent with the REMIC Provisions and shall not, based on a Nondisqualification Opinion addressed to the Special Servicer and the Trustee (the cost of which shall be an expense of the Trust) take any action that could result in the failure of any REMIC Pool to qualify as a REMIC while any Certificates are outstanding or could result in the imposition of a tax upon any REMIC Pool (including, but not limited to, the tax on "prohibited transactions" as defined in Section 860F(a)(2) of the Code or on contributions pursuant to Section 860G(d)), unless such action has been approved by a vote of 100% of the Certificateholders (including the Class R Certificateholders).



 Section 9.17     Sale of Defaulted Mortgage Loans.



  (a)           Promptly upon a Mortgage Loan becoming a Defaulted Mortgage Loan and if the Special Servicer determines in accordance with the Servicing Standard that it would be in the best interests of the Certificateholders (as a collective whole as if such Certificateholders constituted a single lender) to attempt to sell such Defaulted Mortgage Loan, the Special Servicer shall use reasonable efforts to solicit offers for such Defaulted Mortgage Loan on behalf of the Certificateholders and any related B Note holder or Serviced Companion Loan holder in such manner as will be reasonably likely to realize a fair price.  Subject to the provisions of this Section 9.17 and Section 10.3, the Special Servicer shall accept the first (and, if multiple offers are contemporaneously received, the highest) cash offer received from any Person that constitutes a fair price for such Defaulted Mortgage Loan.



  (b)           The Special Servicer shall give the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator, the Custodian, the 17g-5 Information Provider, the Controlling Class Representative (during any Subordinate Control Period and any Collective Consultation Period), the Master Servicer, the Trust Advisor (other than during any Subordinate Control Period) and the holder of any related B Note or Serviced Companion Loan not less than five (5) Business Days' prior written notice of its intention to sell any Defaulted Mortgage Loan.  No Interested Person shall be obligated to submit an offer to purchase any Defaulted Mortgage Loan, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, neither the Trustee, in its individual capacity, nor any of its Affiliates may make an offer for or purchase any Defaulted Mortgage Loan pursuant hereto.



  (c)           Whether any cash offer constitutes a fair price for any Defaulted Mortgage Loan for purposes of this Section 9.17 shall be determined by the Special Servicer, if the highest







 offer is from a Person other than an Interested Person, or by the Trustee (determined either by itself or by retaining an independent third party as set forth below), if the highest offer is from an Interested Person; provided that, no offer from an Interested Person shall constitute a fair price unless (i) it is the highest offer received and (ii) at least one (1) other offer is received from an independent third party.  In all cases under this Section 9.17, in determining whether any offer received from an Interested Person represents a fair price for any Defaulted Mortgage Loan, the Trustee, if making such determination itself, shall be supplied with and shall rely on the most recent Appraisal or updated Appraisal conducted in accordance with this Agreement within the preceding nine (9) month period or, in the absence of any such Appraisal, on a new Appraisal.  The appraiser conducting any such new appraisal shall be an Appraiser selected by the Special Servicer if no Interested Person is making an offer with respect to a Defaulted Mortgage Loan and selected by the Trustee if an Interested Person is so making an offer.  The cost of any such narrative appraisal shall be covered by, and shall be reimbursable as, a Servicing Advance.  Where any Interested Person is among those making an offer with respect to a Defaulted Mortgage Loan, the Special Servicer shall require that all offers be submitted to the Trustee in writing and be accompanied by a refundable cash deposit in an amount equal to 5% of the offered amount from the person making such offer.  Such refundable cash deposits shall be held in an escrow account maintained and administered by the Special Servicer unless the Special Servicer is an offeror.  In such case, the refundable cash deposits shall be held in an escrow account maintained and administered by the Certificate Administrator.  With respect to any such account to be established and maintained by the Certificate Administrator, the Special Servicer shall provide written notice to the Certificate Administrator that such account is necessary, which notice shall contain the wiring instructions for each bidding party to be used to return such funds to each bidder not selected as the winning bidder.   After the Certificate Administrator establishes such escrow account the Special Servicer shall deliver the applicable refundable cash deposits to such account.  The Certificate Administrator shall be entitled to rely conclusively on the information in such notice. At the conclusion of the bidding process, the Special Servicer or the Certificate Administrator, as applicable, shall return the deposit of all bidders not selected as the winning bidder.  In determining whether any such offer from a Person other than an Interested Person constitutes a fair price for any such Defaulted Mortgage Loan, the Special Servicer shall take into account (in addition to the results of any Appraisal, updated Appraisal or narrative appraisal that it may have obtained pursuant to this Agreement within the prior nine (9) months), and in determining whether any offer from an Interested Person constitutes a fair price for any such Defaulted Mortgage Loan, any appraiser shall be instructed to take into account, as applicable, among other factors, the period and amount of any delinquency on the Defaulted Mortgage Loan, the occupancy level and physical condition of the related Mortgaged Property and the state of the local economy.  The Purchase Price for any Defaulted Mortgage Loan shall in all cases be deemed a fair price.  Notwithstanding anything contained in this paragraph to the contrary, if the Trustee is required to determine whether a cash offer by an Interested Person constitutes a fair price, the Trustee may (at its option and at the expense of the Trust) designate an independent third party expert in real estate or commercial mortgage loan matters with at least five (5) years' experience in valuing mortgage loans similar to the subject Mortgage Loan, that has been selected with reasonable care by the Trustee to determine if such cash offer constitutes a fair price for such Mortgage Loan.  If the Trustee designates such a third party to make such determination, the Trustee shall be entitled to rely conclusively upon such third party's determination.  The reasonable costs of all appraisals, inspection reports and broker opinions of







 value, incurred by any such third party pursuant to this paragraph will be covered by, and will be reimbursable as, a Servicing Advance; provided that, the Trustee shall not engage a third party expert whose fees exceed a commercially reasonable amount as determined by the Trustee.



  (d)           Subject to the other subsections of this Section 9.17, the Special Servicer shall act on behalf of the Trust in negotiating and taking any other action necessary or appropriate in connection with the sale of any Defaulted Mortgage Loan, and the collection of all amounts payable in connection therewith.  In connection therewith, the Special Servicer may charge prospective offerors, and may retain, fees that approximate the Special Servicer's actual costs in the preparation and delivery of information pertaining to such sales or exchanging offers without obligation to deposit such amounts into the Collection Account.  Any sale of any Defaulted Mortgage Loan shall be for cash.  Any sale of any Defaulted Mortgage Loan shall be final and without recourse to the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator, the Custodian or the Trust (except such recourse to the Trust imposed by those representations and warranties typically given in such transactions and any customary closing matters), and if such sale is consummated in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, none of the Special Servicer, the Master Servicer, the Depositor, the Custodian, the Certificate Administrator or the Trustee shall have any liability to any Certificateholder with respect to the purchase price therefor accepted by the Special Servicer or the Trustee.



  (e)           Subject to the rights of a holder of any related B Note, Serviced Companion Loan or mezzanine loan, under the respective Intercreditor Agreement or mezzanine loan intercreditor agreement, as applicable, to purchase a Mortgage Loan, unless and until a Defaulted Mortgage Loan is sold pursuant to this Section 9.17, the Special Servicer shall continue to service and administer such Mortgage Loan in accordance with the Servicing Standard and this Agreement and shall pursue such other resolutions or recovery strategies including workout, foreclosure or sale of such Mortgage Loan, as is consistent with this Agreement and the Servicing Standard.



  (f)           The purchase price for any Defaulted Mortgage Loan purchased under this Section 9.17 shall be remitted to the Master Servicer for deposit into the Collection Account, and the Custodian (on the Trustee's behalf), upon receipt of a request for release from the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as applicable, to the Custodian and the Trustee, shall release or cause to be released to the purchaser of the Defaulted Mortgage Loan the related Mortgage File, and the Trustee, the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as applicable, shall execute and deliver such instruments of transfer or assignment, in each case without recourse, as shall be necessary to vest in such purchaser ownership of such Mortgage Loan.  In connection with any such purchase, the Special Servicer (to the extent it has possession of such file) and the Master Servicer (to the extent it has possession of such file) shall deliver the related Servicer Mortgage File to such purchaser.



  (g)           Notwithstanding any of the foregoing paragraphs of this Section 9.17, but subject to Section 10.3, the Special Servicer shall not be obligated to accept the highest cash offer if the Special Servicer determines (in consultation with the Trust Advisor, during any Collective Consultation Period and any Senior Consultation Period, and subject to the rights of the Controlling Class Representative set forth in Section 10.3), in accordance with the Servicing Standard, that rejection of such offer would be in the best interests of the Certificateholders (as a







 collective whole as if such Certificateholders constituted a single lender), and the Special Servicer may accept a lower cash offer (from any Person other than itself or an Affiliate) if it determines, in its reasonable and good faith judgment, that acceptance of such offer would be in the best interests of the Certificateholders (as a collective whole as if such Certificateholders constituted a single lender) (for example, if the prospective buyer making the lower offer is more likely to perform its obligations or the terms offered by the prospective buyer making the lower offer are more favorable).



  (h)           In no event shall the Trust or the Trustee, the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer on the Trustee's behalf purchase, or pay or advance costs to purchase, any B Note or Serviced Companion Loan.



  (i)           In the case of a Defaulted Mortgage Loan that is part of a Loan Pair, if the Special Servicer determines to attempt to sell such Mortgage Loan it shall sell such Defaulted Mortgage Loan together with the related Serviced Companion Loan as a whole loan pursuant to this Agreement and the terms of the related Intercreditor Agreement.



 With respect to any such Defaulted Mortgage Loan, the Special Servicer shall solicit offers for such Defaulted Mortgage Loan together with the related Serviced Companion Loan as a whole loan and shall require that all offers be submitted to the Trustee in writing and be accompanied by a refundable deposit of cash (which shall be held by the Certificate Administrator on behalf of the Trustee) in an amount equal to 5% of the offer amount (subject to a cap of $2,500,000).  Whether any cash offer constitutes a fair price for any such Loan Pair for purposes of this Section 9.17 shall be determined by the Special Servicer (unless the offeror is an Interested Person, in which case the Trustee shall make such determination); provided, that no offer from an Interested Person (as defined in the related Intercreditor Agreement) for a Loan Pair shall constitute a fair price unless (i) it is the highest offer received and (ii) at least two bona fide other offers are received from independent third parties.  In determining whether any offer received represents a fair price for any such Loan Pair, the Trustee shall be supplied with and shall rely on the most recent Appraisal or updated Appraisal conducted in accordance with this Agreement within the preceding nine (9)-month period or, in the absence of any such Appraisal, on a new Appraisal.  The Trustee shall select the appraiser conducting any such new Appraisal.  The cost of any such Appraisal shall be covered by, and shall be reimbursable as, a Servicing Advance.  In determining whether any such offer from a Person constitutes a fair price for any such Loan Pair, the Trustee shall instruct the appraiser to take into account (in addition to the results of any Appraisal or updated Appraisal that it may have obtained pursuant to this Agreement within the prior nine (9) months), as applicable, among other factors, the period and amount of any delinquency on the affected Loan Pair, the occupancy level and physical condition of the related Mortgaged Property and the state of the local economy.  The Trustee may conclusively rely on the opinion of an Independent appraiser or other Independent expert in real estate matters retained by the Trustee at the expense of the Trust and the holder of the related Serviced Companion Loan in connection with making such determination.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Special Servicer shall not be permitted to sell the Loan Pair without the written consent of the related Serviced Companion Loan holder unless the Special Servicer has delivered to such holder:  (a) at least 15 Business Days prior written notice of any decision to attempt to sell the Loan Pair; (b) at least 10 days prior to the proposed sale, a copy of each bid package (together with any amendments to such bid packages) received by the Special Servicer in







 connection with any such proposed sale, (c) at least 10 days prior to the proposed sale, a copy of the most recent Appraisal for the Loan Pair, and any documents in the Servicer Mortgage File requested by the Serviced Companion Loan holder and (d) until the sale is completed, and a reasonable period of time (but no less time than is afforded to other offerors and the Controlling Class Representative) prior to the proposed sale date, all information and other documents being provided to other offerors and all leases or other documents that are approved by the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer in connection with the proposed sale; provided, that the related Serviced Companion Loan holder may waive any of the delivery or timing requirements set forth in this sentence. Subject to the foregoing, each of the Controlling Class Representative, the Serviced Companion Loan holder or a representative thereof shall be permitted to bid at any sale of a Loan Pair.



  Notwithstanding anything contained in the preceding paragraph to the contrary, if the Trustee is required to determine whether a cash offer by an Interested Person constitutes a fair price, the Trustee may (at its option and at the expense of the Trust) designate an independent third party expert in real estate or commercial mortgage loan matters with at least five (5) years' experience in valuing loans similar to the subject mortgage loan, that has been selected with reasonable care by the Trustee to determine if such cash offer constitutes a fair price for such mortgage loan.  If the Trustee designates such a third party to make such determination, the Trustee shall be entitled to rely conclusively upon such third party's determination.  The reasonable costs of all appraisals, inspection reports and broker opinions of value incurred by any such third party pursuant to this paragraph shall be covered by, and shall be reimbursable from, the Collection Account, to the extent of the pro rata portion allocable to the related Mortgage Loan, and the related Serviced Companion Loan Custodial Account, to the extent of the pro rata portion allocable to the related Serviced Companion Loan; provided, that, the Trustee shall not engage a third party expert whose fees exceed a commercially reasonable amount as determined by the Trustee.



  (j)           Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, any purchase of a Defaulted Mortgage Loan pursuant to this Section 9.17 will remain subject to the cure and purchase rights of, in each case if applicable, the holder of any related B Note or Serviced Companion Loan as set forth in the related Intercreditor Agreement and any holder of a related mezzanine loan as set forth in the related mezzanine loan intercreditor agreement.  The Special Servicer shall determine the price to be paid in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement or the related mezzanine loan intercreditor agreement in connection with any such purchase rights in favor of the holder of the related B Note, Serviced Companion Loan or mezzanine loan, as applicable, and shall provide such notices to the holder of the related B Note, Serviced Companion Loan or mezzanine loan, as applicable, as are required by the Intercreditor Agreement or the related mezzanine loan intercreditor agreement, as the case may be, in connection with each such holders' purchase rights.







  Section 9.18     A/B Whole Loans.  The parties acknowledge that the Special Servicer shall not be entitled or required to exercise the rights and powers granted to any "Note B Holder" as defined under the related Intercreditor Agreement.  Subject to Section 10.3, when (i) any A Note or B Note under any A/B Whole Loan, (ii) any Serviced Pari Passu Mortgage Loan or Serviced Companion Loan under any Loan Pair, or (iii) any Mortgage Loan with any related mezzanine loan, as applicable, constitutes a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan, the Special Servicer shall be entitled to exercise the rights and powers granted under the related Intercreditor Agreement or mezzanine loan intercreditor agreement that the Master Servicer would be entitled to exercise under Section 8.3(j) hereof with respect to the related A Note, Serviced Pari Passu Mortgage Loan or Mortgage Loan, as applicable.

If the conditions to the proviso in the foregoing sentence are not met, the Trustee may terminate the Special Servicer's servicing of the Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans pursuant hereto, such termination to be effected in the manner set forth in Section 9.31.  The successor or surviving Person shall provide prompt notice of the merger or consolidation to the other parties hereto and the 17g-5 Information Provider.

Notice of such resignation shall be given promptly by the Special Servicer to the other parties to this Agreement.

The Trustee, the Depositor, the Certificate Administrator, the Custodian, the Trust Advisor or the Master Servicer shall immediately notify the Special Servicer if a claim is made by a third party with respect to this Agreement or the Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans entitling the Trust or the Trustee, the Depositor, the Certificate Administrator, the Custodian, the Trust Advisor or the Master Servicer, as the case may be, to indemnification hereunder, whereupon the Special Servicer shall assume the defense of any such claim (with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, the Depositor,







 the Certificate Administrator, the Custodian, the Trust Advisor or the Master Servicer, as the case may be) and pay all expenses in connection therewith, including counsel fees, and promptly pay, discharge and satisfy any judgment or decree which may be entered against it or them in respect of such claim.  Any failure to so notify the Special Servicer shall not affect any rights the Trust or the Trustee, the Depositor, the Certificate Administrator, the Custodian, the Trust Advisor or the Master Servicer may have to indemnification under this Agreement or otherwise, unless the Special Servicer's defense of such claim is materially prejudiced thereby.  Any expenses incurred or indemnification payments made by the Special Servicer shall be reimbursed by the party so paid or at the direction of which a payment was made, if a court of competent jurisdiction makes a final, non-appealable judgment that the conduct of the Special Servicer was not culpable or such indemnifying party was found to not have acted with willful misfeasance, bad faith or negligence.



  (c)           The indemnification provided in Sections 9.24(a) and 9.24(b) shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the termination or resignation of the Special Servicer, the Certificate Administrator, the Custodian, the Trust Advisor, the Master Servicer or the Trustee.

The Special Servicer or any agent of the Special Servicer in its individual capacity or in any other capacity may become the owner or pledgee of Certificates with the same rights as it would have if they were not the Special Servicer or such agent.  Any such interest of the Special Servicer or such agent in the Certificates shall not be taken into account when evaluating whether actions of the Special Servicer are consistent with its obligations in accordance with the Servicing Standard regardless of whether such actions may have the effect of benefiting the Class or Classes of Certificates owned by the Special Servicer.



 Section 9.27     Tax Reporting.  The Special Servicer shall provide the necessary information to the Master Servicer to allow the Master Servicer to comply with the Mortgagor tax reporting requirements imposed by Sections 6050H, 6050J and 6050P of the Code with respect to any Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan and any REO Property.  The Special Servicer shall provide to the Master Servicer copies of any such reports.  The Master Servicer shall forward such reports to the Certificate Administrator.







 Section 9.28      Application of Funds Received.  It is anticipated that the Master Servicer will be collecting all payments with respect to the Mortgage Loans, any Serviced Companion Loan and any B Note (other than payments with respect to REO Income).  If, however, the Special Servicer should receive any payments with respect to any Mortgage Loan (other than REO Income) it shall, within one (1) Business Day of receipt from the Mortgagor or otherwise of any amounts attributable to payments with respect to or the sale of any Mortgage Loan or any Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan, if any (but not including REO Income, which shall be deposited in the applicable REO Account as provided in Section 9.14 hereof) remit such payment or other amounts (endorsed, if applicable, to the order of the Master Servicer), to the Master Servicer for deposit into the Collection Account.  The Special Servicer shall notify the Master Servicer of each such amount received on or before the date required for the making of such deposit or transfer, as the case may be, indicating the Mortgage Loan or Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan to which the amount is to be applied and the type of payment made by or on behalf of the related Mortgagor.



 Section 9.29     Compliance with REMIC Provisions and Grantor Trust Provisions.  The Special Servicer shall act in accordance with this Agreement and the REMIC Provisions and related provisions of the Code in order to create or maintain the status of any REMIC Pool as a REMIC or, as appropriate, adopt a plan of complete liquidation.  The Special Servicer shall not (A) take any action or cause any REMIC Pool to take any action that could (i) endanger the status of any REMIC Pool as a REMIC under the Code or (ii) subject to Section 9.14(e), result in the imposition of a tax upon any REMIC Pool (including, but not limited to, the tax on prohibited transactions as defined in Code Section 860F(a)(2) or on contributions pursuant to Section 860G(d)) or (B) take any action or cause the Grantor Trust to take any action that could (i) endanger its status as a grantor trust, an "investment trust" under Treasury Regulations Section 301.7701-4(c), or a "domestic trust" under Treasury Regulations Section 301.7701-7 or (ii) result in the imposition of any tax upon the Grantor Trust unless the Master Servicer and the Certificate Administrator have received a Nondisqualification Opinion (at the expense of the party seeking to take such action) to the effect that the contemplated action will not endanger such status or result in the imposition of such tax.  The Special Servicer shall comply with the provisions of Article XII hereof.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Special Servicer shall not be liable for an Adverse REMIC Event resulting from the failure of any Mortgage Loan by its terms to comply with Revenue Procedure 2010-30 or other REMIC Provisions.

  (iv)           the Special Servicer has made one or more false or misleading representations or warranties herein that materially and adversely affects the interest of any Class of Certificates, and has failed to cure such breach within thirty (30) days after notice of such breach, requiring the same to be remedied, shall have been given to the Special Servicer by the Depositor or the Trustee, provided such cure period may be extended to the extent necessary to permit the Special Servicer to cure such failure if (A) the Special Servicer certifies to the Trustee and the Depositor that the Special Servicer is in good faith attempting to remedy such failure, and (B) the Certificateholders shall not be materially and adversely affected thereby; provided that such cure period may not exceed 90 days;



  (v)           a decree or order of a court or agency or supervisory authority having jurisdiction in the premises in an involuntary case under any present or future federal or state bankruptcy, insolvency or similar law for the appointment of a conservator, receiver, liquidator, trustee or similar official in any bankruptcy, insolvency, readjustment of debt, marshalling of assets and liabilities or similar proceedings, or for the winding-up or liquidation of its affairs, shall have been entered against the Special Servicer and such decree or order shall have remained in force undischarged or unstayed for a period of sixty (60) days;







  (vi)           the Special Servicer shall consent to the appointment of a conservator, receiver, liquidator, trustee or similar official in any bankruptcy, insolvency, readjustment of debt, marshalling of assets and liabilities or similar proceedings relating to the Special Servicer or of or relating to all or substantially all of its property;



  (vii)           the Special Servicer shall admit in writing its inability to pay its debts generally as they become due, file a petition to take advantage of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization statute, make an assignment for the benefit of its creditors, voluntarily suspend payment of its obligations, or take any corporate action in furtherance of the foregoing;



  (viii)           (a) a servicing officer of the Special Servicer obtains knowledge that KBRA or Moody's has (A) qualified, downgraded or withdrawn its rating or ratings of one or more Classes of Certificates or securities backed by a B Note or Serviced Companion Loan or (B) placed one or more Classes of Certificates on "watch status" in contemplation of a ratings downgrade or withdrawal (and, in the case of either of clauses (A) or (B), such qualification, downgrade, withdrawal or "watch status" placement shall not have been withdrawn by KBRA or Moody's, as applicable, within sixty (60) days of the date such servicing officer of the Special Servicer obtained such actual knowledge) and, in the case of either of clauses (A) or (B), cited servicing concerns with the Special Servicer as the sole or material factor in such rating action or (b) the Special Servicer ceases to have a special servicer rating of at least "CSS3" from Fitch and such rating is not reinstated within sixty (60) days;



  (ix)           if, and for so long as the Trust or a trust created pursuant to an Other Companion Loan Pooling and Servicing Agreement is subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Special Servicer, or any Servicing Function Participant appointed by the Special Servicer, shall fail to comply with any of its obligations under Article XIII of this Agreement; or



  (x)           if, and for so long as the Trust or a trust created pursuant to an Other Companion Loan Pooling and Servicing Agreement is subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Special Servicer shall fail to terminate, on the same terms and conditions as those set forth in Section 8.4 for a Sub-Servicer of the Master Servicer, any Sub-Servicer appointed by the Special Servicer.



 Such termination shall be effective on the date that the Trustee specifies in a written notice to the Special Servicer that the Special Servicer is terminated due to the occurrence of one of the foregoing events and the expiration of any applicable cure period or grace period specified above for such event.  During any Subordinate Control Period, the Controlling Class Representative shall have the right to appoint a successor Special Servicer if the Trustee terminates the existing Special Servicer.



 With respect to any Loan Pair, if any event described clauses 9.30(b)(i)-(x) has occurred that affects the holder of the related Serviced Companion Loan, such holder shall have the right to direct the Trustee to terminate the Special Servicer under this Agreement solely with respect to such Loan Pair.







 Any event described in clauses (i) through (viii) of the first (1st) sentence of the first paragraph of this subsection (b) may be waived by the Holders of Certificates evidencing not less than 66-2/3% of the aggregate Voting Rights of the Certificates (except a default in making any required deposits to or payments from the Collection Account or the Distribution Account or in remitting payments as received, in each case in accordance with this Agreement).



 (c)           During any Subordinate Control Period, the Controlling Class Representative shall have the right to terminate the Special Servicer at any time, with or without cause, and the Controlling Class Representative shall have the right to, and shall, appoint a successor Special Servicer meeting the requirements of Section 9.30(g), who will execute and deliver to the other parties hereto an agreement, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, whereby the successor Special Servicer agrees to assume and perform punctually the duties of the Special Servicer specified in this Agreement; provided that the Trustee shall have provided each Rating Agency and each other NRSRO with respect to any securities rated by any such NRSRO evidencing interests in any Serviced Companion Loan or B Note with a Rating Agency Communication prior to the termination of the Special Servicer.  The Special Servicer shall not be terminated pursuant to this paragraph until a successor Special Servicer shall have been appointed.  The Controlling Class Representative shall pay any costs and expenses incurred by the Trust in connection with the removal and appointment of a Special Servicer pursuant to this paragraph (unless such removal is based on any of the events or circumstances set forth in Section 9.30(b)).  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no successor Special Servicer appointed by the Controlling Class Representative pursuant to Section 9.21(a), Section 9.30(b) or this Section 9.30(c) will be required to meet any net worth requirements.



 During any Collective Consultation Period and any Senior Consultation Period, upon (i) the written direction of Holders of Certificates evidencing not less than 25% of the aggregate Voting Rights of the Certificates requesting a vote to terminate and replace the Special Servicer with a proposed successor Special Servicer meeting the requirements of Section 9.30(g), (ii) payment by such Holders to the Certificate Administrator and/or the Trustee of the reasonable fees and expenses to be incurred by the Certificate Administrator and/or the Trustee in connection with administering such vote and (iii) delivery by, and at the expense of, such Holders to each Rating Agency (with a copy to the Certificate Administrator and the Trustee) of a Rating Agency Communication with respect to the termination of the existing Special Servicer and the replacement thereof with the proposed successor, the Certificate Administrator shall promptly provide written notice thereof to all Certificateholders by posting such notice on its internet website and by mailing at their addresses appearing in the Certificate Register.  Upon the written direction of Holders of Certificates evidencing at least 75% of the aggregate Voting Rights of the Certificates, the Trustee shall terminate all of the rights and obligations of the Special Servicer under this Agreement, and the proposed successor Special Servicer shall succeed to the duties of the Special Servicer all as if a removal and replacement were occurring pursuant to Section 9.30(b) and Section 9.31; provided that if such written direction is not provided within 180 days of the initial request for a vote to terminate and replace the Special Servicer, then such written direction shall have no force and effect.  The provisions set forth in the foregoing sentences of this paragraph shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of solely the Certificateholders and the Trustee as between each other.  The Special Servicer shall not have any cause of action based upon or arising from any breach or alleged breach of such provisions.  As between the Special Servicer, on the one hand, and the Certificateholders, on the other, the







 Certificateholders shall be entitled in their sole discretion to vote for the termination or not vote for the termination of the Special Servicer.  The Holders of the Certificates that initiated the vote to replace the Special Servicer shall pay the costs and expenses incurred in connection with the removal and replacement of the Special Servicer pursuant to this paragraph.



 In addition, during any Senior Consultation Period, if the Trust Advisor determines that the Special Servicer is not performing its duties in accordance with the Servicing Standard, the Trust Advisor may recommend the replacement of the Special Servicer.  In such event, the Trust Advisor shall deliver to the Trustee and Certificate Administrator, with a copy to the Special Servicer, a written recommendation (along with the relevant information justifying its recommendation) of a suggested replacement special servicer.  The Certificate Administrator shall notify each Certificateholder of the recommendation and post it on the Certificate Administrator's Website.  The replacement of the Special Servicer based on the Trust Advisor's recommendation must be confirmed by an affirmative vote of the Holders of Principal Balance Certificates evidencing greater than 50% of the aggregate Voting Rights of all Principal Balance Certificates on an aggregate basis; provided that if a proposed termination and replacement of the Special Servicer following the initial recommendation of the Trust Advisor is not consummated within 180 days following the initial recommendation of the Trust Advisor, then the proposed termination and replacement shall have no further force and effect.  If the Holders of such Principal Balance Certificates elect to remove and replace the Special Servicer, the Trustee shall provide to each Rating Agency a Rating Agency Communication at that time.  If the successor special servicer agrees to be bound by the terms of this Agreement, the Trustee shall terminate all of the rights and obligations of the Special Servicer under this Agreement and appoint the successor special servicer approved by the Certificateholders, provided such successor special servicer satisfies the requirements of Section 9.30(g), subject to the terminated Special Servicer's rights to indemnification, payment of outstanding fees, reimbursement of Advances and other rights set forth in this Agreement which survive termination.  The reasonable costs and expenses associated with the Trust Advisor's identification of a replacement special servicer, providing the Rating Agency Communications and administering the vote of the applicable Principal Balance Certificates will be an Additional Trust Expense.  In any case, the Trustee shall notify the outgoing Special Servicer promptly of the effective date of its termination.



  (d)           Notwithstanding any of the foregoing to the contrary, the holder of a Serviced Companion Loan or B Note, to the extent set forth in the related Intercreditor Agreement and only for so long as it is the related Loan-Specific Directing Holder, shall have the sole right to terminate the Special Servicer with respect to the related Loan Pair or A/B Whole Loan, as applicable, upon the appointment and acceptance of such appointment by a successor to the Special Servicer; provided that, if the holder of the related Serviced Companion Loan or B Note so terminates the Special Servicer, the holder of that Serviced Companion Loan or B Note shall appoint a successor Special Servicer who will (i) in the case of the related Loan Pair or A/B Whole Loan, be reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee and to the Depositor; and (ii) execute and deliver to the Trustee an agreement, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, whereby the successor Special Servicer agrees to assume and perform punctually the duties of the Special Servicer specified in this Agreement; and provided, further, that the Trustee shall provide to each Rating Agency a Rating Agency Communication prior to the termination of the Special Servicer.  The Special Servicer shall not be terminated pursuant to this Section 9.30(d) until a successor Special Servicer shall have been appointed.  The holder of







 the applicable Serviced Companion Loan or B Note shall pay any costs and expenses incurred by the Trust in connection with the removal and appointment of a Special Servicer pursuant to this paragraph (unless such removal is based on any of the events or circumstances set forth in Section 9.30(b)).  If the holder of a Serviced Companion Loan or B Note terminates the Special Servicer with respect to the related Loan Pair or A/B Whole Loan, as applicable, and appoints a successor special servicer with respect to such Loan Pair or A/B Whole Loan, as applicable, then the Controlling Class Representative (or the Holders of the applicable percentage of Certificates) shall not have the right to terminate any such successor special servicer without cause until the holder of the related Serviced Companion Loan or B Note is no longer the Loan-Specific Directing Holder with respect to such Loan Pair or A/B Whole Loan, as applicable.



  (e)           Reserved.



  (f)           If a replacement special servicer is appointed with respect to a Loan Pair or an A/B Whole Loan at the request of the Loan-Specific Directing Holder of such Loan Pair or A/B Whole Loan or at the request of a Serviced Companion Loan holder, as applicable, in accordance with Section 9.30(d) (any such replacement special servicer, a "Loan-Specific Special Servicer"), such that there are multiple parties acting as Special Servicer hereunder, then, unless the context clearly requires otherwise: (i) when used in the context of imposing duties and obligations on the Special Servicer hereunder or the performance of such duties and obligations, the term "Special Servicer" shall mean the related Loan-Specific Special Servicer, insofar as such duties and obligations relate to a Loan Pair or an A/B Whole Loan, as applicable, as to which a Loan-Specific Special Servicer has been appointed, and shall mean the General Special Servicer, in all other cases; (ii) when used in the context of identifying the recipient of any information, funds, documents, instruments and/or other items, the term "Special Servicer" shall mean the related Loan-Specific Special Servicer, insofar as such information, funds, documents, instruments and/or other items relate to a Loan Pair or A/B Whole Loan, as applicable, as to which a Loan-Specific Special Servicer has been appointed in accordance with Section 9.30(d), and shall mean the General Special Servicer, in all other cases; (iii) when used in the context of granting the Special Servicer the right to purchase all of the Mortgage Loans and any REO Properties remaining in the Trust pursuant to Section 11.1(b), the term "Special Servicer" shall mean the General Special Servicer only; (iv) when used in the context of granting the Special Servicer any protections, limitations on liability, immunities and/or indemnities hereunder, the term "Special Servicer" shall mean each Loan-Specific Special Servicer and the General Special Servicer; and (v) when used in the context of requiring indemnification from, imposing liability on, or exercising any remedies against, the Special Servicer for any breach of a representation or warranty hereunder or for any negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct in the performance of duties and obligations hereunder or any negligent disregard of such duties and obligations or otherwise holding the Special Servicer responsible for any of the foregoing, the term "Special Servicer" shall mean the related Loan-Specific Special Servicer or the General Special Servicer, as applicable.  References in this Section 9.30(f) to "General Special Servicer" mean the Person performing the duties and obligations of Special Servicer with respect to the Mortgage Loans (exclusive of each and every A/B Whole Loan and Loan Pair as to which a Loan-Specific Special Servicer has been appointed).



  (g)           In no event may a successor Special Servicer be a current or former Trust Advisor or any Affiliate of such current or former Trust Advisor.  Further, such successor must







 be a Person that satisfies all of the eligibility requirements applicable to special servicers contained in this Agreement (other than any net worth requirement during any Subordinate Control Period when the Controlling Class Representative is appointing the successor Special Servicer in accordance with Section 9.21(a), Section 9.30(b) or Section 9.30(c)) and, if applicable, any Intercreditor Agreement; provided, that no Rating Agency Confirmation shall be required in connection with the appointment of any Special Servicer other than pursuant to Section 9.21(b) of this Agreement.  The Special Servicer, any successor Special Servicer and any of their respective Affiliates shall not (i) pay, or become obligated, whether by agreement or otherwise, and whether or not subject to any condition or contingency, to pay the Trust Advisor or any Affiliate thereof any fee, or otherwise compensate or grant monetary or other consideration to the Trust Advisor or any Affiliate thereof (x) in connection with its obligations under this Agreement or the performance thereof or (y) in connection with the appointment of such Person as, or any recommendation by the Trust Advisor for such Person to become, the successor Special Servicer, (ii) become entitled to receive any compensation from the Trust Advisor (x) in connection with its obligations under this Agreement or the performance thereof or (y) in connection with the appointment of such Person as, or any recommendation by the Trust Advisor for such Person to become, the successor Special Servicer or (iii) become entitled to receive any fee from the Trust Advisor or any Affiliate thereof in connection with the appointment of such Person as Special Servicer, unless, in each of the foregoing clauses (i) through (iii), such transaction has been expressly approved by 100% of the Certificateholders.



  (h)           If the Special Servicer is terminated under this Agreement, it shall continue to have any rights to any and all compensation, reimbursement of Advances and any other amounts due to the Special Servicer hereunder which were earned, accrued or expended prior to termination.

Upon any such termination, the rights and duties of the Special Servicer (other than the rights and duties of the Special Servicer pursuant to Sections 9.8, 9.21, 9.23, 9.24 and 9.28 hereof) shall terminate and the Special Servicer shall transfer to the Master Servicer the amounts remaining in each REO Account and shall thereafter terminate each REO Account and any other account or fund maintained with respect to the Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans.



  (b)           On the date specified in a written notice of termination given to the Special Servicer pursuant to clause (ii) of Section 9.30(a), all authority, power and rights of the Special Servicer under this Agreement, whether with respect to the Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans or otherwise, shall terminate, subject to the Special Servicer's right to receive compensation and indemnification as expressly provided herein, as well as the benefit of any other rights that survive termination hereunder; provided, that in no event shall the termination of the Special Servicer be effective until the Trustee or other successor Special Servicer shall have succeeded the Special Servicer as successor Special Servicer, notified the Special Servicer of







 such designation, and such successor Special Servicer shall have assumed the Special Servicer's obligations and responsibilities, as set forth in an agreement substantially in the form hereof, with respect to the Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans.  The Trustee or other successor Special Servicer may not succeed the Special Servicer as Special Servicer until and unless it has satisfied the provisions that would apply to a Person succeeding to the business of the Special Servicer pursuant to Section 9.20 hereof and otherwise complies with Section 9.30(g).  The Trustee is hereby authorized and empowered to execute and deliver, on behalf of the Special Servicer, as attorney-in-fact or otherwise, any and all documents and other instruments, and to do or accomplish all other acts or things necessary or appropriate to effect the purposes of such notice of termination.

  (f)           The Special Servicer shall deliver to the Master Servicer, the Depositor, the Certificate Administrator, the Trustee and the Custodian all such other information with







 respect to the Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans at such times and to such extent as the Master Servicer, the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator or the Depositor may from time to time reasonably request; provided that the Special Servicer shall not be required to produce any ad hoc non-standard written reports with respect to such Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans except if any Person (other than the Certificate Administrator or the Trustee) requesting such report pays a reasonable fee to be determined by the Special Servicer.



  (g)           The Special Servicer shall deliver electronically a written Inspection Report of each Mortgaged Property securing a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan in accordance with Section 9.3(b) to the Master Servicer (who shall deliver electronically such written inspection report to the Certificate Administrator, the 17g-5 Information Provider, the Controlling Class Representative (during any Subordinate Control Period and any Collective Consultation Period), and the Trust Advisor (other than during any Subordinate Control Period)).



  (h)           The Special Servicer shall prepare a report (the "Asset Status Report") recommending the taking of certain actions for each Mortgage Loan that becomes a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan and deliver such Asset Status Report, together with all information reasonably requested by the Applicable Control Party in the possession of the Special Servicer that is reasonably necessary to make a decision regarding the Asset Status Report, to the Controlling Class Representative (during any Subordinate Control Period and any Collective Consultation Period) or any related Loan-Specific Directing Holder (with respect to an A/B Whole Loan or a Loan Pair as to which the holder of the related B Note or Serviced Companion Loan, as applicable, or its designee is the related Loan-Specific Directing Holder), as applicable, and the Master Servicer, the Certificate Administrator, the 17g-5 Information Provider and, during any Collective Consultation Period and any Senior Consultation Period, the Trust Advisor not later than forty-five (45) days after the servicing of such Mortgage Loan is transferred to the Special Servicer.  Such Asset Status Report shall set forth the following information to the extent reasonably determinable:



  (i)            a summary of the status of such Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan and any negotiations with the related Mortgagor;



  (ii)           a discussion of the legal and environmental considerations reasonably known to the Special Servicer (including without limitation by reason of any Phase I Environmental Assessment and any additional environmental testing contemplated by Section 9.12(c)), consistent with the Servicing Standard, that are applicable to the exercise of remedies set forth herein and to the enforcement of any related guaranties or other collateral for the related Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan and whether outside legal counsel has been retained;



  (iii)           the most current rent roll and income or operating statement available for the related Mortgaged Property or Mortgaged Properties;



  (iv)           a summary of the applicable Special Servicer's recommended action with respect to such Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan;







  (v)           the Appraised Value of the related Mortgaged Property or Mortgaged Properties, together with the assumptions used in the calculation thereof (which the Special Servicer may satisfy by providing a copy of the most recently obtained Appraisal); and



  (vi)          such other information as the applicable Special Servicer deems relevant in light of the Servicing Standard.



  If (i) the Applicable Control Party affirmatively approves in writing an Asset Status Report, (ii) after ten (10) Business Days from receipt of an Asset Status Report, together with all information in the possession of the Special Servicer that is necessary for the Applicable Control Party to make a decision regarding the Asset Status Report, the Applicable Control Party does not object to such Asset Status Report or (iii) within ten (10) Business Days after receipt of an Asset Status Report, together with all information in the possession of the Special Servicer that is necessary for the Applicable Control Party to make a decision regarding the Asset Status Report, the Applicable Control Party objects to such Asset Status Report and the Special Servicer makes a determination in accordance with the Servicing Standard that such objection is not in the best interest of all the Certificateholders and any holder of a related B Note or Serviced Companion Loan, as a collective whole, then the Special Servicer shall take the recommended actions described in the Asset Status Report.  Within ten (10) Business Days after receipt of an Asset Status Report, together with all information reasonably requested by the Applicable Control Party in the possession of the Special Servicer that is reasonably necessary to make a decision regarding the Asset Status Report, the Applicable Control Party may object to such Asset Status Report; provided that following the occurrence of an extraordinary event with respect to the related Mortgaged Property, or if a failure to take any such action at such time would be inconsistent with the Servicing Standard, the Special Servicer may take actions with respect to the related Mortgaged Property before the expiration of such ten (10) Business Day period if the Special Servicer reasonably determines in accordance with the Servicing Standard that failure to take such action before the expiration of such ten (10) Business Day period would materially and adversely affect the interest of the Certificateholders and the holder of any related B Note or Serviced Companion Loan, and the Special Servicer has made a reasonable effort to contact the Applicable Control Party, as applicable.  If the Applicable Control Party objects to an Asset Status Report, together with all information reasonably requested by the Applicable Control Party in the possession of the Special Servicer that is reasonably necessary for the Applicable Control Party to make a decision regarding the Asset Status Report, within the above-referenced ten (10) Business Day period, then the Special Servicer (absent a determination set forth in clause (iii) of the first sentence of this paragraph) shall revise such Asset Status Report as soon as practicable thereafter, but in no event later than thirty (30) days after the objection to the Asset Status Report by the Applicable Control Party.  The Special Servicer shall revise such Asset Status Report as provided in the prior sentence until the earlier of (a) the delivery by the Applicable Control Party of an affirmative approval in writing of such revised Asset Status Report, and (b) the failure of the Applicable Control Party to disapprove such revised Asset Status Report in writing within ten (10) Business Days of its receipt thereof.  In any event, if the Applicable Control Party does not approve an Asset Status Report within ninety (90) days from the submission of such Asset Status Report, the Special Servicer shall take such action as directed by the Applicable Control Party, provided that such action does not violate the Servicing Standard.  The Special Servicer may, from time to time, modify any Asset Status Report it has







 previously delivered and implement the new action in such revised report so long as such revised report has been prepared, reviewed and either approved or not rejected as provided above.



 Other than with respect to an A/B Whole Loan or a Loan Pair as to which the holder of the related B Note or Serviced Companion Loan, as applicable, or its designee is the related Loan-Specific Directing Holder, each of the Trust Advisor (during any Collective Consultation Period and any Senior Consultation Period) and the Controlling Class Representative (during any Collective Consultation Period) will be entitled to consult with the Special Servicer and propose alternative courses of action in respect of any Asset Status Report.  During any Collective Consultation Period and any Senior Consultation Period, other than with respect to an A/B Whole Loan or a Loan Pair as to which the holder of the related B Note or Serviced Companion Loan, as applicable, or its designee is the related Loan-Specific Directing Holder, the Special Servicer shall consider such alternative courses of action and any other feedback provided by the Trust Advisor or the Controlling Class Representative, as applicable.  The Special Servicer may revise the Asset Status Reports as it deems reasonably necessary in accordance with the Servicing Standard to take into account any input and/or recommendations of the Trust Advisor (and, during any Collective Consultation Period, the Controlling Class Representative).



 The Asset Status Report is not intended to replace or satisfy any other specific consent or approval right which the Applicable Control Party may have.



 The Special Servicer may not take any action inconsistent with an Asset Status Report that has been adopted as provided above, unless such action would be required in order to act in accordance with the Servicing Standard.  If the Special Servicer takes any action inconsistent with an Asset Status Report that has been adopted as provided above, the Special Servicer shall promptly notify the Applicable Control Party of such inconsistent action and provide a reasonably detailed explanation of the reasons therefor.



 The Special Servicer shall deliver to the Master Servicer, the Controlling Class Representative (during any Subordinate Control Period and any Collective Consultation Period), the Trust Advisor and the 17g-5 Information Provider (which shall promptly post the same to the 17g-5 Information Provider's Website) a copy of each Final Asset Status Report, in each case with reasonable promptness following the adoption thereof.  In addition, the Special Servicer shall prepare and forward to the Certificate Administrator (who shall promptly post same on the Certificate Administrator's Website) and the 17g 5 Information Provider (who shall promptly post same on the 17g 5 Information Provider's Website) a summary of any Final Asset Status Report (which summary shall solely reflect such Final Asset Status Report and not include extraneous information).



 Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary:  (i) the Special Servicer shall have no right or obligation to consult with or to seek and/or obtain consent or approval from any Controlling Class Representative prior to acting (and provisions of this Agreement requiring such consultation, consent or approval shall be of no effect) during the period following any resignation or removal of a Controlling Class Representative and before a replacement is selected; and (ii) no advice, direction or objection from or by (x) the Controlling Class Representative, as contemplated by Section 10.3 or any other provision of this Agreement, (y) a







  Loan-Specific Directing Holder, as contemplated by this Agreement or the related Intercreditor Agreement, or (z) the Trust Advisor, as contemplated by this Agreement, may (and the applicable Special Servicer shall ignore and act without regard to any such advice, direction or objection that such Special Servicer has determined, in its reasonable, good faith judgment, would):  (A) require or cause such Special Servicer to violate applicable law, the terms of any Mortgage Loan or any other Section of this Agreement, including the applicable Special Servicer's obligation to act in accordance with the Servicing Standard, (B) result in an Adverse REMIC Event with respect to any REMIC Pool or an Adverse Grantor Trust Event with respect to the Grantor Trust, (C) expose the Trust, any Certificateholder the Depositor, the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, Certificate Administrator, the Custodian, the Trustee or any of their respective Affiliates, members, managers, officers, directors, employees or agents, to any material claim, suit or liability or (D) materially expand the scope of the Master Servicer's or Special Servicer's responsibilities under this Agreement.



  (i)           With respect to each Collection Period, the Special Servicer shall deliver or cause to be delivered to the Certificate Administrator, without charge and within two Business Days following the end of such Collection Period, a report that discloses and contains an itemized listing of any Disclosable Special Servicer Fees received by the Special Servicer or any of its Affiliates during the related Collection Period.

  (a)           Subject to Section 5.4(e), the Special Servicer shall furnish on a timely basis such reports, certifications, and information as are reasonably requested by the Master Servicer, the Trustee, the Custodian or the Certificate Administrator to enable it to perform its duties under this Agreement; provided that no such request shall (i) require or cause the Special Servicer to violate the Code, any provision of this Agreement, including the Special Servicer's obligation to act in accordance with the Servicing Standard and to maintain the REMIC status of any REMIC Pool and the grantor trust status of the Grantor Trust or (ii) expose the Special Servicer, the Trust, the Certificate Administrator, the Custodian or the Trustee to liability or materially expand the scope of the Special Servicer's responsibilities under this Agreement.  In addition, the Special Servicer shall notify the Master Servicer of all expenditures incurred by it with respect to the Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans which are required to be made by the Master Servicer as Servicing Advances as provided herein, subject to the provisions of Section 4.4 hereof.  The Special Servicer shall also remit all invoices relating to Servicing Advances promptly upon receipt of such invoices.



  (b)           In addition to any other rights that a Controlling Class Representative or Loan-Specific Directing Holder may have hereunder, the Special Servicer shall from time to time make reports, recommendations and analyses to the Controlling Class Representative (during any Subordinate Control Period and any Collective Consultation Period and other than with respect to an A/B Whole Loan or a Loan Pair as to which the holder of the related B Note or Serviced Companion Loan, as applicable, or its designee is the related Loan-Specific Directing Holder) or any related Loan-Specific Directing Holder (with respect to an A/B Whole Loan or a Loan Pair as to which the holder of the related B Note or Serviced Companion Loan, as applicable, or its







 designee is the related Loan-Specific Directing Holder), as applicable, with respect to the following matters, the expense of which shall not be an expense of the Trust:



  (i)            whether the foreclosure of a Mortgaged Property relating to a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan would be in the best economic interest of the Trust;



  (ii)            if the Special Servicer elects to proceed with a foreclosure, whether a deficiency judgment should or should not be sought because the likely recovery will or will not be sufficient to warrant the cost, time and exposure of pursuing such judgment;



  (iii)           whether the waiver or enforcement of any "due-on-sale" clause or "due-on-encumbrance" clause contained in a Mortgage Loan (other than any Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan) or a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan is in the best economic interest of the Trust;



  (iv)           in connection with entering into an assumption agreement from or with a person to whom a Mortgaged Property securing a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan has been or is about to be conveyed, whether to release the original Mortgagor from liability upon a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan and substitute a new Mortgagor, and whether the credit status of the prospective new Mortgagor is in compliance with the Special Servicer's regular commercial mortgage origination or servicing standard;



  (v)           in connection with the foreclosure on a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan secured by a Mortgaged Property which is not in compliance with CERCLA, or any comparable environmental law, whether it is in the best economic interest of the Trust to bring the Mortgaged Property into compliance therewith and an estimate of the cost to do so; and



 (vi)           with respect to any proposed modification (which shall include any proposed release, substitution or addition of collateral), extension, waiver, amendment, discounted payoff or sale of a Mortgage Loan (other than any Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan), prepare a summary of such proposed action and an analysis of whether or not such action is reasonably likely to produce a greater recovery on a net present value basis (calculated in accordance with Section 1.2(e)) than liquidation of such Mortgage Loan; such analysis shall specify the basis on which the Special Servicer made such determination, including the status of any existing material default or the grounds for concluding that a payment default is imminent.



 Section 9.34       Litigation Control.



 The Master Servicer, with respect to litigation involving non-Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans (other than any Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan), and the Special Servicer, with respect to litigation involving Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans and the enforcement of the obligations of a Mortgagor under the related Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan documents, and in each case where the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as applicable, contemplates availing itself of indemnification as provided for under this Agreement, shall, for the benefit of the Certificateholders, direct, manage, prosecute, defend and/or settle any and all claims and litigation relating to any action brought by the Mortgagor against the Trust or the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as applicable, with respect to any such Mortgage Loan (the foregoing rights and obligations, "Litigation Control").  Such Litigation Control shall be carried







 out in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, including, without limitation, the Servicing Standard.  Upon becoming aware of or being named in any claims or litigation, the Master Servicer or Special Servicer, as applicable, shall promptly notify the Controlling Class Representative (during any Subordinate Control Period or any Collective Consultation Period) and the Special Servicer (in the case of the Master Servicer) and the Master Servicer (in the case of the Special Servicer) of such claims or litigation, and the Master Servicer and the Special Servicer, as applicable, shall prepare and submit a notice of such claims or litigation to the 17g-5 Information Provider (subject to Section 5.7) (and the 17g-5 Information Provider shall promptly post same on the 17g-5 Information Provider's Website pursuant to Section 5.7).



 The Special Servicer (with respect to Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans) and the Master Servicer (with respect to non-Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans), as applicable, shall, during any Subordinate Control Period or any Collective Consultation Period, consult with and keep the Controlling Class Representative advised of any material development concerning Litigation Control, including, without limitation, (i) any material decision concerning Litigation Control and the implementation thereof and (ii) any decision to agree to or propose any terms of settlement, and shall, during any Subordinate Control Period, submit (in written form) any such development or decision to the Controlling Class Representative for its approval or consent.  During any Subordinate Control Period and subject to the Servicing Standard, the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as applicable, shall not take any action implementing any such material development or decision described in the preceding sentence unless and until it has provided such notice to the Controlling Class Representative and the Controlling Class Representative has not objected in writing within five (5) Business Days of receipt of such notice and all information that the Controlling Class Representative has reasonably requested with respect thereto.  The Controlling Class Representative shall be deemed to have approved the taking of such action if such written objection has not been received by the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as applicable, within such 5-Business Day period.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as applicable, determines that immediate action is necessary to protect the interests of the Certificateholders (as a collective whole) and Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as applicable, has confirmed (during any Subordinate Control Period) that the Controlling Class Representative has received written notice of such action, then the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as applicable, may take such action without waiting for the Controlling Class Representative's response.



 Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, with respect to any Litigation Control relating to a non-Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan that has either (i) been satisfied or paid in full, or (ii) as to which a Final Recovery Determination has been made, after receiving the required notice from the Master Servicer or Special Servicer set forth above that the Master Servicer or Special Servicer, as applicable, became aware of or was named in any such claims or litigation, the Controlling Class Representative (during any Subordinate Control Period) or the Special Servicer (during any Collective Consultation Period or Senior Consultation Period) may direct in writing that such Litigation Control be exercised by the Special Servicer; provided, that the Controlling Class Representative or the Special Servicer in accordance with the Servicing Standard, as applicable, has determined and advised the Master Servicer that the Master Servicer's actions with respect to such obligations are indemnifiable under this Agreement, and accordingly, any loss, liability or expense (including legal fees and







 expenses incurred up until the date such Litigation Control is so transferred and is not otherwise paid to the Master Servicer pursuant to this Agreement) shall be payable by the Trust.



 Notwithstanding the foregoing, no advice, direction or objection of, or consent withheld by, the Controlling Class Representative shall (i) require or cause the Special Servicer or the Master Servicer, as applicable, to violate the terms of any Mortgage Loan document, any Intercreditor Agreement or similar agreement, applicable law or any provision of this Agreement, including the Master Servicer's and Special Servicer's obligation to act in accordance with the Servicing Standard and the related Mortgage Loan documents and to maintain the REMIC status of any REMIC created under this Agreement, or (ii) result in an Adverse REMIC Event with respect to any REMIC created under this Agreement or an Adverse Grantor Trust Event with respect to the Grantor Trust or have adverse tax consequences for the Trust Fund, or (iii) expose any party to this Agreement, any Seller, any Underwriter or Initial Purchaser, any Sub-Servicer or the Trust Fund or any of their respective Affiliates, officers, directors, partners, members, managers, employees or agents to any claim, suit, or liability for which this Agreement does not provide indemnification to such party or expose any such party to prosecution for a criminal offense, or (iv) materially expand the scope of the Master Servicer's, the Special Servicer's, the Certificate Administrator's, the Trustee's or the Trust Advisor's responsibilities under this Agreement.  In addition, neither the Master Servicer nor the Special Servicer will follow any such advice, direction or objection if given by the Controlling Class Representative, or initiate any such actions, that would have the effect described in clauses (i)-(iv) of the preceding sentence.  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Master Servicer shall retain the right to make all determinations relating to any claims or judgments against the Master Servicer, including but not limited to the right to engage separate counsel in the Master Servicer's reasonable discretion, the cost of which shall be subject to indemnification hereunder.



 Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (i) if any action, suit, litigation or proceeding names the Certificate Administrator, the Trustee or the Custodian, as applicable, in its individual capacity, or if any judgment is rendered against the Certificate Administrator, the Trustee or the Custodian, as applicable, in its individual capacity, the Certificate Administrator, the Trustee or the Custodian, as applicable, upon prior written notice to the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as applicable, may retain counsel and appear in any such proceeding on its own behalf in order to protect and represent its interests (but not to otherwise direct, manage or prosecute such litigation or claim); (ii) in any action, suit, litigation or proceeding, other than an action, suit, litigation or proceeding directly relating to the enforcement of the obligations of a Mortgagor, guarantor or other obligor under the related Mortgage Loan documents, or otherwise directly relating to one or more Mortgage Loans or Mortgaged Properties, neither of the Master Servicer nor the Special Servicer shall, without the prior written consent of the Certificate Administrator, the Trustee or the Custodian, as applicable, (A) initiate any action, suit, litigation or proceeding in the name of the Certificate Administrator, the Trustee or the Custodian, as applicable, whether in such capacity or individually, (B) engage counsel to represent the Certificate Administrator, the Trustee or the Custodian, as applicable, or (C) prepare, execute or deliver any government filings, forms, permits, registrations or other documents or take any other similar action with the intent to cause, and that actually causes, the Certificate Administrator, the Trustee or the Custodian, as applicable, to be registered to do business in any state (provided that neither the Master Servicer nor the Special Servicer shall be responsible for







 any delay due to the unwillingness of the Certificate Administrator, the Trustee or the Custodian, as applicable, to grant such consent); and (iii) if any court finds that the Certificate Administrator, the Trustee or the Custodian, as applicable, is a necessary party in respect of any action, suit, litigation or proceeding relating to or arising from this Agreement or any Mortgage Loan, the Certificate Administrator, the Trustee or the Custodian, as applicable, shall have the right to retain counsel and appear in any such proceeding on its own behalf in order to protect and represent its interest, whether as Certificate Administrator, the Trustee or the Custodian, as applicable, or individually (but not to otherwise direct, manage or prosecute such litigation or claim).  Nothing in this paragraph shall be interpreted to preclude either the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer from initiating any Litigation Control related action, suit, litigation or proceeding in its name as a representative of the Trust Fund.

 (a)           Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, except as set forth in, and in any event subject to, Section 10.3(b), Section 10.3(c) and the second (2nd) and third (3rd) paragraphs of this Section 10.3(a), (i) the Master Servicer shall not be permitted to take any of the actions constituting a Major Decision unless it has obtained the consent of the Special Servicer (which approval shall be deemed given if the Special Servicer does not object within fifteen (15) Business Days (or (i) in the case of an action relating to an A/B Whole Loan or Loan Pair while the holder of the related B Note or Serviced Companion Loan, as the case may be, is the related Loan-Specific Directing Holder, within the period expiring five (5) Business Days following the expiration of the related Loan-Specific Directing Holder's decision period under the related Intercreditor Agreement, and (ii) in the case of a determination of an Acceptable Insurance Default, ninety (90) days) of receipt of the Master Servicer's written analysis and recommendation together with any information in the possession of the Master Servicer that is reasonably required to make a decision regarding the subject action), and (ii) the Special Servicer shall not be permitted to consent to the Master Servicer's taking any of the actions constituting a Major Decision, nor will the Special Servicer itself be permitted to take any of the actions constituting a Major Decision, (A) during any Subordinate Control Period, as to which the Controlling Class Representative has objected in writing within ten (10) Business Days (or in the case of a determination of an Acceptable Insurance Default, thirty (30) days), or (B) in the case of an action relating to an A/B Whole Loan or Loan Pair while the holder of the related B Note or Serviced Companion Loan, as the case may be, is the related Loan-Specific Directing Holder, as to which the related Loan-Specific Directing Holder has objected within the decision period provided for under the related Intercreditor Agreement, in each case after receipt of the written recommendation and analysis from the Special Servicer, together with any information in the possession of the Special Servicer that is reasonably necessary to make a decision regarding the subject action (provided that if such written objection has not been received by the Special Servicer within such ten (10) Business Day (or, in the case of a determination of an Acceptable Insurance Default, thirty (30) day) period, then the Controlling Class Representative will be deemed to have approved such action); provided that if the Special Servicer or Master Servicer (if the Master Servicer is otherwise authorized by this Agreement to take such action), as applicable, determines that immediate action, with respect to a Major Decision, or any other matter requiring consent of the Controlling Class Representative during any Subordinate Control Period, is necessary to protect the interests of the Certificateholders and, with respect to any A/B Whole Loan or Loan Pair, the holder of the related B Note or Serviced Companion Loan, as applicable (as a collective whole as if such Certificateholders and the holder of such B Note or







 Serviced Companion Loan, as the case may be, constituted a single lender), the Special Servicer or Master Servicer, as applicable, may take any such action without waiting for the Controlling Class Representative's (or, if applicable, the Special Servicer's) response; provided, further, that the Special Servicer is not required to obtain the consent of the Controlling Class Representative for any of the foregoing actions during any Collective Consultation Period or any Senior Consultation Period; provided, further, that the Special Servicer will be required to consult, solely on a non-binding basis (and to consider alternative actions recommended by each such party) (i) during any Collective Consultation Period and any Senior Consultation Period, with the Trust Advisor, as to any of the Major Decisions, and (ii) during any Collective Consultation Period, with the Controlling Class Representative with respect to any of the Major Decisions and any other matter as to which consent of the Controlling Class Representative would have been required during any Subordinate Control Period.



 In addition, during any Subordinate Control Period, subject to Section 10.3(b), Section 10.3(c) and the immediately following paragraph, the Controlling Class Representative may direct the Special Servicer to take, or to refrain from taking, such other actions with respect to a Mortgage Loan, A/B Whole Loan or Loan Pair as the Controlling Class Representative may deem advisable or as to which provision is otherwise made herein.  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no such direction, and no direction or objection contemplated by the preceding paragraph or any other provision of this Agreement, may require or cause the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer to violate any provision of any loan documents, any Intercreditor Agreement, applicable law, this Agreement or the REMIC Provisions, including without limitation the Special Servicer's obligation to act in accordance with the Servicing Standard, or expose the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Trust Advisor, the Certificate Administrator, the Custodian, the Trustee or the Trust to liability, or materially expand the scope of the Special Servicer's responsibilities hereunder.  Furthermore, in addition to the Controlling Class Representative's rights of consent and consultation (as applicable) as set forth in Section 10.3(a) above, it is understood and agreed that to the extent any other provision of this Agreement requires the provision of notice to, the obtaining of consent of, and/or consultation with, the Controlling Class Representative, or otherwise provides for any right of the Controlling Class Representative thereunder, then none of the Trustee, the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer shall be entitled to take any action (or omit to take any action) in contravention of the applicable rights of the Controlling Class Representative contained in such provision; provided that this sentence is not intended to in any way (i) expand the rights of the Controlling Class Representative, (ii) limit the application of the immediately preceding sentence, (iii) remove any limitations on the exercise of such rights set forth in, such other provisions, or (iv) require the Trustee, the Master Servicer and/or the Special Servicer to send a notice to, obtain the consent of, or consult with a new Controlling Class Representative whose name and contact information have not yet been provided to the Trustee, the Master Servicer and/or the Special Servicer; and provided, further, that if such other provisions are in any way subject to this Section 10.3, then the exercise of such rights shall be subject to Section 10.3(b) and the immediately following paragraph.



 If the Special Servicer or Master Servicer, as applicable, determines that a refusal to consent by the Controlling Class Representative or any direction or advice from the Controlling Class Representative would otherwise cause the Special Servicer or Master Servicer, as applicable, to violate the terms of any loan documents, any Intercreditor Agreement,







 applicable law, the REMIC Provisions or this Agreement, including without limitation, the Servicing Standard, the Special Servicer or Master Servicer, as applicable, shall disregard such refusal to consent, direction or advice and notify the Controlling Class Representative, the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator and the 17g-5 Information Provider of its determination, including a reasonably detailed explanation of the basis therefor.  The taking of, or refraining from taking, any action by the Master Servicer or Special Servicer in accordance with the direction of or approval of the Controlling Class Representative that does not violate any loan documents, any Intercreditor Agreement, any applicable law, the REMIC Provisions, or the Servicing Standard or any other provisions of this Agreement, will not result in any liability on the part of the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer.



 (b)           During any Senior Consultation Period, the Controlling Class Representative shall have no consultation rights under this Agreement and shall have no right to receive any notices, reports or information (other than notices, reports or information required to be delivered to all Certificateholders) or any other rights as Controlling Class Representative; provided that the Controlling Class Representative (if and to the extent that it is a Certificateholder) will maintain the right to exercise its Voting Rights for the same purposes as any other Certificateholder under this Agreement.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein:  (i) for so long as the holder of any related B Note or Serviced Companion Loan, as applicable, or its designee is the Loan-Specific Directing Holder with respect to any A/B Whole Loan or Loan Pair, the Controlling Class Representative will not be entitled to exercise any of the rights in Section 10.3(a) with respect to such A/B Whole Loan or Loan Pair, as the case may be, or any related REO Property; and (ii) the Controlling Class Representative shall not have any consent or consultation rights with respect to any Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan.



 (c)           Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, for so long as the holder of any related B Note or Serviced Companion Loan, as applicable, or its designee is the Loan-Specific Directing Holder with respect to any A/B Whole Loan or Loan Pair, (i) such Loan-Specific Directing Holder shall be entitled to exercise with respect to such A/B Whole Loan or Loan Pair, as the case may be, or any related REO Property all of the rights and powers of such Loan-Specific Directing Holder under the related Intercreditor Agreement, and (ii) the Controlling Class Representative shall not have any of the consent rights or rights to direct the Special Servicer contemplated by Section 10.3(a) with respect to such A/B Whole Loan or Loan Pair, as the case may be, or any related REO Property except as set forth in the related Intercreditor Agreement.  The rights of the holder of any related B Note or Serviced Companion Loan, as applicable, or its designee as Loan-Specific Directing Holder with respect to any A/B Whole Loan or Loan Pair will be unaffected by the existence of any Subordinate Control Period, Collective Consultation Period or Senior Consultation Period.



 (d)           No Controlling Class Certificateholder or Controlling Class Representative shall be permitted to direct the Master Servicer to accept a Principal Prepayment (including payment of a Balloon Payment other than in connection with the foreclosure or liquidation of a Mortgage Loan) prior to the Due Date for such Mortgage Loan for the related Collection Period unless, to the extent otherwise permitted pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, such Mortgage Loan is a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan.

No Trust Advisor Annual Report shall be required to be prepared or delivered with respect to any calendar year during which no annual meeting described in Section 10.5(a)(ii) shall have occurred or with respect to any calendar year during which no Asset Status Reports have been prepared.

The Trust Advisor shall not owe any fiduciary duty to the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Certificate Administrator, the Custodian, the Trustee, any Holder of a Certificate or any other Person in connection with this Agreement.  Certificateholders are hereby deemed to have acknowledged and agreed that (i) there could be multiple strategies to resolve any Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan and the directive of the Trust Advisor's participation in any resolution process is to provide additional oversight relating to the Special Servicer's compliance with the Servicing Standard in making its determinations as to which strategy to execute; (ii) the Trust Advisor shall have no authority or duty to make a determination on behalf of the Trust, nor any responsibility for decisions made by or on behalf of the Trust; (iii) the Trust Advisor is not an advisor to any Person, including without limitation any Certificateholder; and (iv) the Trust Advisor is not an "investment advisor" within the meaning of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended.

The Trust Advisor shall review such calculations but shall not take any affirmative action with respect to such Appraisal Reduction calculations and/or net present value calculations.



 (d)           During any Collective Consultation Period and any Senior Consultation Period, after the calculation but prior to the utilization by the Special Servicer of any of the calculations related to (i) Appraisal Reductions or (ii) net present value, the Special Servicer shall promptly forward such calculations, and the Special Servicer shall promptly forward any supporting material or additional information necessary in support thereof (including such additional information reasonably requested by the Trust Advisor to confirm the mathematical accuracy of such calculations, but not including any Privileged Information), to the Trust Advisor but in any event no later than two (2) Business Days after preparing such calculations, and the Trust Advisor shall promptly, but no later than three (3) Business Days after receipt of such calculations and any supporting or additional materials, recalculate and verify the accuracy of the mathematical calculations and the corresponding application of the non-discretionary portions of the applicable formulas required to be utilized in connection with any such calculation prior to utilization by the Special Servicer provided, that notwithstanding the foregoing, the Trust Advisor will not be permitted to recalculate or verify any Appraisal Reduction or net present value calculations performed by the Special Servicer with respect to any B Note or Serviced Companion Loan for so long as the related B Note holder or Serviced Companion Loan holder is the related Applicable Control Party with respect to the related A/B Whole Loan or Loan Pair.  The Trust Advisor may not opine on or call into question these calculations, other than with respect to mathematical errors.



 In connection with this Section 10.5(d), if the Trust Advisor does not agree with the mathematical calculations or the application of the applicable non-discretionary portions of the formula required to be utilized for such calculation, the Trust Advisor and Special Servicer shall consult with each other in order to resolve any inaccuracy in the mathematical calculations or the application of the non-discretionary portions of the related formula in arriving at those mathematical calculations or any disagreement within five (5) Business Days of delivery of such calculations.  If the Trust Advisor and Special Servicer are not able to resolve such inaccuracies or disagreement prior to the end of such 5-Business Day period, the Trust Advisor shall promptly notify the Trustee of such disagreement and the Trustee shall determine which calculation is to apply.  In making such determination, the Trustee may hire an independent third-party to assist with any such calculation at the expense of the Trust.



 (e)           The Trust Advisor shall have no consultation rights with respect to any Non-Serviced Mortgage Loans (or any related REO Mortgage Loans).



 (f)           During any Collective Consultation Period and any Senior Consultation Period, the Special Servicer shall consult (on a non-binding basis) with the Trust Advisor in connection with any Major Decision involving any Mortgage Loan, A/B Whole Loan, Loan Pair or any related REO Property and consider alternative actions recommended by the Trust







 Advisor; provided, that with respect to matters related to any A/B Whole Loan and any Loan Pair, the Special Servicer shall only be required to consult with the Trust Advisor in respect of such A/B Whole Loan or Loan Pair, as applicable, if the holder of the related B Note or Serviced Companion Loan, as applicable, is not, or has ceased to be, the related Loan-Specific Directing Holder.



 (g)           Subject to the requirements of confidentiality imposed on the Trust Advisor herein (including without limitation in respect of Privileged Information), the Trust Advisor shall respond to Inquiries proposed by Privileged Persons from time to time in accordance with the terms of Section 5.4.



 (h)           The Trust Advisor shall keep all Privileged Information confidential and shall not disclose such Privileged Information to any other person (including any Certificateholders), other than to the other parties to this Agreement, to the extent expressly required by this Agreement, which parties, in turn, if they have been advised that such information is Privileged Information, shall not without the prior written consent of the Special Servicer and the Controlling Class Representative (or with respect to an A/B Whole Loan or a Loan Pair any other Applicable Control Party), disclose such information to any other Person, except that such parties and the Trust Advisor may disclose such information if (a) such Privileged Information becomes generally available and known to the public other than as a result of a disclosure directly or indirectly by such parties or the Trust Advisor, as applicable, (b) it is reasonable and necessary for such parties or the Trust Advisor, as applicable, to do so in working with legal counsel, auditors, taxing authorities or other governmental agencies, (c) such Privileged Information was already known to such party or the Trust Advisor, as applicable, and not otherwise subject to a confidentiality obligation and/or (d) such disclosure is required by applicable law, as evidenced by an opinion of counsel (which, in the case of any opinion of counsel for the Trust Advisor, shall be a Trust Advisor Expense) delivered to the Trust Advisor, the Special Servicer, the Controlling Class Representative (or with respect to an A/B Whole Loan or a Loan Pair the Applicable Control Party), as applicable, the Certificate Administrator and the Trustee.

The Trust Advisor hereby acknowledges and agrees that in no event will any Trust Advisor Expenses be payable from, and the Trust Advisor hereby waives any and all claims to, amounts distributable in respect of, the Control Eligible Certificates.  Each successor Trust Advisor shall be required to acknowledge and agree to the terms of the preceding sentence.



 (k)           Except as set forth in this Agreement, the Trust Advisor, any successor trust advisor and any of their respective affiliates shall not accept any fees or other compensation or other consideration (x) in respect of the Trust Advisor's (or successor trust advisor's) obligations under this Agreement or the performance thereof or (y) in connection with the appointment of a successor special servicer or the recommendation by the Trust Advisor (or







 successor trust advisor) for a replacement special servicer to become the special servicer under this Agreement.



 Section 10.6     Representations, Warranties and Covenants of the Trust Advisor.



 (a)           The Trust Advisor hereby represents and warrants to and covenants with each other party to this Agreement, as of the Closing Date:



 (i)            the Trust Advisor is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing as a corporation under the laws of the State of Georgia;



 (ii)           the Trust Advisor has the full power and authority to execute, deliver, perform, and to enter into and consummate all transactions and obligations contemplated by this Agreement; the Trust Advisor has duly and validly authorized the execution, delivery and performance by it of this Agreement and this Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Trust Advisor; and this Agreement, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery thereof by the other parties hereto, evidences the valid and binding obligation of the Trust Advisor enforceable against the Trust Advisor in accordance with its terms subject, as to enforcement of remedies, to applicable bankruptcy, conservatorship, reorganization, insolvency, moratorium, receivership and other similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally as from time to time in effect, and to general principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law), and to matters of public policy with respect to indemnification or contribution as to violations of securities laws;



 (iii)           the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Trust Advisor, the consummation by the Trust Advisor of the transactions contemplated hereby, and the fulfillment of or compliance by the Trust Advisor with the terms and conditions of this Agreement will not (A) result in a breach of any term or provision of its organizational documents or (B) conflict with, result in a breach, violation or acceleration of, or result in a default under, the terms of any other material agreement or instrument to which it is a party or by which it may be bound, or any law, governmental rule, regulation, or judgment, decree or order applicable to it of any court, regulatory body, administrative agency or governmental body having jurisdiction over it, which materially and adversely affects its ability to perform its obligations under this Agreement;



 (iv)           no litigation is pending or, to the best of the Trust Advisor's knowledge, threatened, against it, the outcome of which, in the Trust Advisor's reasonable judgment, could reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect the execution, delivery or enforceability of this Agreement or its ability to perform any of its obligations hereunder in accordance with the terms hereof; and



 (v)            no consent, approval, authorization or order of any court or governmental agency or body is required for the execution, delivery and performance by it of, or compliance by it with, this Agreement, or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, or if any such consent, approval, authorization or order is required, it has obtained the same or will obtain the same prior to the time necessary to perform its obligations under this







 Agreement, and, except to the extent in the case of performance, that its failure to be qualified as a foreign corporation or licensed in one or more states does not materially and adversely affect the performance by it of its obligations hereunder.



 (b)           It is understood that the representations and warranties set forth in this Section 10.6 shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement.



 Any cause of action against the Trust Advisor arising out of the breach of any representations and warranties made in this Section shall accrue upon the giving of written notice to the Trust Advisor by any of the Trustee, the Master Servicer or the Certificate Administrator.  The Trust Advisor shall give prompt notice to each other party to this Agreement and the Controlling Class Representative (during any Subordinate Control Period and any Collective Consultation Period) of the occurrence, or the failure to occur, of any event that, with notice, or the passage of time or both, would cause any representation or warranty in this Section to be untrue or inaccurate in any respect.



 Section 10.7     Merger or Consolidation of the Trust Advisor.  Any Person into which the Trust Advisor may be merged or consolidated, or any Person resulting from any merger, conversion, other change in form or consolidation to which the Trust Advisor shall be a party, or any Person succeeding to the business of the Trust Advisor, shall be the successor of the Trust Advisor hereunder, without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of any of the parties hereto; provided that the successor or surviving Person is an Eligible Trust Advisor.

 Section 10.8     Resignation of Trust Advisor.



 (a)           Except as otherwise provided in Section 10.8(b), the Trust Advisor shall not resign from the obligations and duties hereby imposed on it unless it determines that the Trust Advisor's duties hereunder are no longer permissible under applicable law or are in material conflict by reason of applicable law with any other activities carried on by it.  Any such







 determination permitting the resignation of the Trust Advisor shall be evidenced by an opinion of counsel to such effect delivered to the Master Servicer, the Certificate Administrator, the Depositor and the Trustee.



 (b)           The Trust Advisor (at its cost and expense and not at the expense of the Trust) will have the right to resign from its obligations and duties under this Agreement and recommend the replacement of the Trust Advisor (which shall be an Eligible Trust Advisor), provided that the Trust Advisor shall (i) pay, or reimburse the Certificate Administrator or the Trust, as applicable, for, all of the reasonable costs and expenses to be incurred by the Trust Advisor, the Certificate Administrator and/or the Trust, as applicable, in connection with obtaining the vote to replace the Trust Advisor (and such fees and expenses will not constitute Additional Trust Expenses), (ii) pay any amounts in the nature of Trust Advisor Fees, costs or expenses, to the extent such amounts are in excess of the amounts being paid to the Trust Advisor prior to its resignation, necessary to obtain or payable to a replacement Trust Advisor, (iii) except in the case of a recommended replacement that is an Eligible Trust Advisor (in which event no consent shall be required), obtain the consent (which shall be obtained prior to any solicitation of votes described below) of the Controlling Class Representative during any Subordinate Control Period and any Collective Consultation Period, which consent shall be deemed to have been granted if no objection is made within thirty (30) days following the Controlling Class Representative's receipt of the request for consent and, if granted or deemed granted, such consent cannot thereafter be revoked or withdrawn and (iv) except in the case of a recommended replacement that is an Eligible Trust Advisor (in which event no vote seeking consent shall be conducted), obtain the requisite vote of Certificateholders as provided below.  In such event, the Trust Advisor shall deliver to the Certificate Administrator, with a copy to the Trustee, the 17g-5 Information Provider and the Special Servicer, a written recommendation (along with relevant information justifying its recommendation) of a suggested replacement Trust Advisor, which recommendation shall include a ballot that identifies the proposed replacement and that allows the Holders of Principal Balance Certificates to approve or object to such recommendation and, further, shall clearly and conspicuously include on the face thereof the following legend (in all capital letters and at least 14 point font): "FAILURE TO AFFIRMATIVELY OBJECT TO THIS RECOMMENDATION WITHIN 180 DAYS OF THE DATE HEREOF SHALL BE DEEMED AN AFFIRMATIVE CONSENT TO REPLACE THE EXISTING TRUST ADVISOR WITH THE RECOMMENDED SUCCESSOR TRUST ADVISOR IDENTIFIED IN THIS RECOMMENDATION".  The Certificate Administrator shall post such written recommendation on the Certificate Administrator's Website.  The Trust Advisor's recommendation of a successor Trust Advisor must be confirmed by an affirmative vote of Holders of Principal Balance Certificates evidencing at least 66-2/3% of the aggregate Voting Rights of all Principal Balance Certificates; provided that if any Holder of Principal Balance Certificates does not affirmatively object within 180 days of the date on which such written recommendation was posted on the Certificate Administrator's Website, then such Holder shall be deemed to have consented to the replacement of the existing Trust Advisor with the recommended successor Trust Advisor.  If so confirmed, the Trustee shall terminate all of the rights and obligations of the then existing Trust Advisor under this Agreement and appoint the successor Trust Advisor approved or deemed approved by the Certificateholders (provided that such successor trust advisor is an Eligible Trust Advisor).  The terminated Trust Advisor's rights to indemnification, payment of outstanding fees, reimbursement of expenses and other rights set forth in this Agreement shall survive its termination or resignation.







 (c)           No resignation pursuant to this Section 10.8 shall become effective until a successor Trust Advisor appointed as provided in Section 10.12(d) shall have assumed the Trust Advisor's responsibilities and obligations under this Agreement.

 (a)           Neither the Trust Advisor nor any of the Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, members, managers or agents of the Trust Advisor shall be under any liability to any other party to this Agreement, the Holders of the Certificates, the Underwriters, the Initial Purchasers, the holder of any B Note or the holder of any Serviced Companion Loan for any action taken or for refraining from the taking of any action in good faith and using reasonable business judgment; provided that this provision shall not protect the Trust Advisor or any such person against any breach of a representation or warranty contained herein or any liability which would otherwise be imposed by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith or negligence in its performance of duties hereunder or by reason of negligent disregard of obligations and duties hereunder.  The Trust Advisor and any Affiliate, director, officer, employee, member, manager or agent of the Trust Advisor may rely in good faith on any document of any kind prima facie properly executed and submitted by any Person (including, without limitation, the information and reports delivered by or at the direction of the Master Servicer or any Affiliate, director, officer, employee, member, manager or agent of the Master Servicer) respecting any matters arising hereunder.  The Trust Advisor shall not be under any obligation to appear in, prosecute or defend any legal action which is not incidental to its duties under this Agreement.



 (b)           In addition, the Trust Advisor shall have no liability with respect to, and shall be entitled to conclusively rely on as to the truth of the statements and the correctness of the opinions expressed in any certificates or opinions furnished to the Trust Advisor and conforming to the requirements of this Agreement.  Neither the Trust Advisor, nor any Affiliate, director, officer, employee, member, manager or agent, shall be personally liable for any error of judgment made in good faith by any officer, unless it shall be proved that the Trust Advisor or such officer was negligent in ascertaining the pertinent facts.  Neither the Trust Advisor, nor any Affiliate, director, officer, employee, member, manager or agent, shall be personally liable for any action taken, suffered or omitted by it in good faith and believed by it to be authorized or within the discretion, rights or powers conferred upon it by this Agreement.  The Trust Advisor shall be entitled to rely on reports and information supplied to it by the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer and the related Mortgagors and shall have no duty to investigate or confirm the accuracy of any such report or information.



 (c)           The Trust Advisor shall not be obligated to incur any liabilities, costs, charges, fees or other expenses which relate to or arise from any breach of any representation, warranty or covenant made by any other party to this Agreement in this Agreement.  The Trust shall indemnify and hold harmless the Trust Advisor from any and all claims, liabilities, costs, charges, fees or other expenses which relate to or arise from any such breach of representation,







 warranty or covenant to the extent such amounts are not recoverable from the party committing such breach.



 (d)           Except as otherwise specifically provided herein:



 (i)           the Trust Advisor may rely, and shall be protected in acting or refraining from acting upon, any resolution, officer's certificate, certificate of auditors or any other certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, consent, order, appraisal, bond or other paper or document believed or in good faith believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties;



 (ii)          the Trust Advisor may consult with counsel, and any written advice or opinion of counsel shall be full and complete authorization and protection with respect to any action taken or suffered or omitted by it hereunder in good faith and in accordance with such advice or opinion of counsel; and



 (iii)         the Trust Advisor, in preparing any reports hereunder, may rely, and shall be protected in acting or refraining from acting upon any information (financial or other), statement, certificate, document, agreement, covenant, notice, request or other paper reasonably believed or in good faith believed by it to be genuine.



 (e)           The Trust Advisor and any Affiliate, director, officer, employee, member, manager or agent of the Trust Advisor shall be indemnified by the Depositor, the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Custodian, the Trustee and the Certificate Administrator, as the case may be, and held harmless against any loss, liability or expense including reasonable attorneys' fees incurred in connection with any legal action relating to the Depositor's, the Master Servicer's, the Special Servicer's, the Custodian's, the Trustee's or the Certificate Administrator's, as the case may be, respective willful misfeasance, bad faith or negligence in the performance of its respective duties hereunder or by reason of negligent disregard by such Person of its respective duties hereunder, other than any loss, liability or expense incurred by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith or negligence in the performance of any of the Trust Advisor's duties hereunder or by reason of negligent disregard of the Trust Advisor's obligations and duties hereunder.  The Trust Advisor shall promptly notify the Depositor, the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Custodian, the Trustee and the Certificate Administrator, if a claim is made by a third party entitling the Trust Advisor to indemnification hereunder, whereupon the Depositor, the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Custodian, the Trustee or the Certificate Administrator, in each case, to the extent the claim was made in connection with its willful misfeasance, bad faith or negligence, shall assume the defense of any such claim (with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Trust Advisor).  Any failure to so notify the Depositor, the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Custodian, the Trustee or the Certificate Administrator shall not affect any rights the Trust Advisor may have to indemnification hereunder or otherwise, unless the interest of the Depositor, the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Custodian, the Trustee or the Certificate Administrator is materially prejudiced thereby.  The indemnification provided herein shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the termination or resignation of the Trust Advisor hereunder.  Any payment hereunder made by the Depositor, the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator or the Custodian, as the case may be, pursuant to this paragraph to the Trust







 Advisor shall be paid from the Depositor's, the Master Servicer's, the Special Servicer's, the Trustee's, the Certificate Administrator's or the Custodian's, as the case may be, own funds, without reimbursement from the Trust therefor, except achieved through subrogation as provided in this Agreement.  Any expenses incurred or indemnification payments made by the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator, the Custodian, the Special Servicer, the Master Servicer or the Depositor shall be reimbursed by the party so paid or at the direction of which a payment was made, if a court of competent jurisdiction makes a final judgment that (x) the conduct of the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator, the Custodian, the Special Servicer, the Master Servicer or the Depositor, as the case may be, was not culpable or (y) such indemnifying party was found to not have acted with willful misfeasance, bad faith or negligence.



 Section 10.11     Indemnification; Third-Party Claims.



 (a)           The Trust Advisor and any Affiliate, director, officer, employee, member, manager or agent of the Trust Advisor shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Trust, out of the proceeds of the Mortgage Loans (subject to Section 6.11) against any and all claims, losses, penalties, fines, forfeitures, legal fees and related costs, judgments and any other costs, liabilities, fees and expenses incurred in connection with any legal action relating to this Agreement, other than any loss, liability or expense (i) specifically required to be borne by the party seeking indemnification, without right of reimbursement pursuant to the terms of this Agreement; (ii) incurred in connection with any legal action or claim against the party seeking indemnification, resulting from any breach on the part of that party of a representation or warranty made in this Agreement; or (iii) incurred in connection with any legal action or claim against the party seeking indemnification, resulting from any willful misfeasance, bad faith or negligence on the part of that party in the performance of its obligations or duties under this Agreement or negligent disregard of such obligations or duties.  The Trust shall pay, from amounts on deposit in the Collection Account pursuant to Section 5.2, all expenses in connection therewith, including counsel fees, and promptly pay, discharge and satisfy any judgment or decree which may be entered against it or them in respect of such claim.  The indemnification provided herein shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the termination or resignation of the Trust Advisor. Any expenses incurred or indemnification payments made by the Trust shall be reimbursed by the Trust Advisor, if a court of competent jurisdiction makes a final, non-appealable judgment that the Trust Advisor was found to have acted with willful misfeasance, bad faith or negligence.



 (b)           The Trust Advisor agrees to indemnify the Trust and each other party to this Agreement and any of their respective directors, officers, employees or agents or Controlling Persons, and hold them harmless against any and all claims, losses, penalties, fines, forfeitures, legal fees and related costs, judgments, and any other costs, liabilities, fees and expenses that the Trust or any such party may sustain arising from or as a result of the willful misfeasance, bad faith or negligence in the performance of duties hereunder or by reason of negligent disregard of obligations and duties hereunder by the Trust Advisor.  The Trustee, the Depositor, the Certificate Administrator, the Custodian, the Special Servicer or the Master Servicer shall immediately notify the Trust Advisor if a claim is made by a third party with respect to this Agreement or the Mortgage Loans entitling the Trust or the Trustee, the Depositor, the Certificate Administrator, the Custodian, the Special Servicer or the Master Servicer, as the case may be, to indemnification hereunder, whereupon the Trust Advisor shall assume the defense of







 any such claim (with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, the Depositor, the Certificate Administrator, the Custodian, the Special Servicer or the Master Servicer, as the case may be) and pay all expenses in connection therewith, including counsel fees, and promptly pay, discharge and satisfy any judgment or decree which may be entered against it or them in respect of such claim.  Any failure to so notify the Trust Advisor shall not affect any rights the Trust or the Trustee, the Depositor, the Certificate Administrator, the Custodian, the Special Servicer or the Master Servicer may have to indemnification under this Agreement or otherwise, unless the Trust Advisor's defense of such claim is materially prejudiced thereby.  The indemnification provided herein shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the termination or resignation of the Trust Advisor, the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Certificate Administrator, the Custodian or the Trustee.  The Trust Advisor shall not be entitled to reimbursement from the Trust for any payment made by the Trust Advisor pursuant to this paragraph.  Any expenses incurred or indemnification payments made by the Trust Advisor shall be reimbursed by the party so paid or at the direction of which a payment was made, if a court of competent jurisdiction makes a final, non-appealable judgment that the conduct of the Trust Advisor was not culpable or such indemnifying party was found to not have acted with willful misfeasance, bad faith or negligence.



 Section 10.12     Termination of the Trust Advisor.



 (a)           A "Trust Advisor Termination Event" means any one of the following events whether it shall be voluntary or involuntary or be effected by operation of law or pursuant to any judgment, decree or order of any court or any order, rule or regulation of any administrative or governmental body:



 (i)           any failure by the Trust Advisor to observe or perform in any material respect any of its covenants or agreements or the material breach of its representations or warranties under this Agreement, which failure or breach shall continue unremedied for a period of thirty (30) days after the date on which written notice of such failure or breach shall have been given to the Trust Advisor by the Trustee or the Certificate Administrator or to the Trust Advisor and the Certificate Administrator by the Holders of Certificates having greater than 25% of the aggregate Voting Rights of all then outstanding Certificates; provided that with respect to any such failure or breach which is not curable within such 30-day period, the Trust Advisor shall have an additional cure period of thirty (30) days to effect such cure so long as it has commenced to cure such failure or breach with the initial 30-day period and has provided the Trustee and the Certificate Administrator with an Officer's Certificate certifying that it has diligently pursued, and is continuing to pursue, such cure;



 (ii)          any failure by the Trust Advisor to perform in accordance with the Trust Advisor Standard which failure shall continue unremedied for a period of thirty (30) days;



 (iii)         any failure by the Trust Advisor to be an Eligible Trust Advisor, which failure shall continue unremedied for a period of thirty (30) days;



 (iv)         a decree or order of a court or agency or supervisory authority having jurisdiction in the premises in an involuntary case under any present or future federal or state bankruptcy, insolvency or similar law for the appointment of a conservator or receiver or







 liquidator in any insolvency, readjustment of debt, marshaling of assets and liabilities or similar proceedings, or for the winding-up or liquidation of its affairs, shall have been entered against the Trust Advisor, and such decree or order shall have remained in force undischarged or unstayed for a period of sixty (60) days;



 (v)          the Trust Advisor shall consent to the appointment of a conservator or receiver or liquidator or liquidation committee in any insolvency, readjustment of debt, marshaling of assets and liabilities, voluntary liquidation, or similar proceedings of or relating to the Trust Advisor or of or relating to all or substantially all of its property;



 (vi)         the Trust Advisor shall admit in writing its inability to pay its debts generally as they become due, file a petition to take advantage of any applicable insolvency or reorganization statute, make an assignment for the benefit of its creditors, or voluntarily suspend payment of its obligations; or



 (vii)        if, and for so long as the Trust or a trust created pursuant to an Other Companion Loan Pooling and Servicing Agreement is subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Trust Advisor shall fail to deliver any Regulation AB and any Exchange Act reporting items required to be delivered by it under Article XIII of this Agreement at the times required under such Article.



 Upon receipt by the Certificate Administrator of notice of the occurrence of any Trust Advisor Termination Event, the Certificate Administrator shall promptly provide written notice to all Certificateholders by posting such notice on its internet website and by mail, unless the Certificate Administrator has received notice that it has been remedied. If a Trust Advisor Termination Event shall occur, then, and in each and every such case, so long as such Trust Advisor Termination Event shall not have been remedied, either (i) the Trustee may or (ii) upon the written direction of Holders of Certificates evidencing not less than 25% of the Voting Rights of all the Certificates, the Trustee shall, terminate all of the rights and obligations of the Trust Advisor under this Agreement, other than rights and obligations accrued prior to such termination, by notice in writing to the Trust Advisor.  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Depositor shall have the right, but not the obligation, to notify the Certificate Administrator and the Trustee of any Trust Advisor Termination Event of which the Depositor becomes aware.



 (b)           Upon (i) the written direction of Holders of Certificates evidencing not less than 25% of the Voting Rights of all the Certificates requesting a vote to terminate the existing Trust Advisor and to replace the existing Trust Advisor with a proposed successor Trust Advisor that is an Eligible Trust Advisor, (ii) payment by such Holders to the Trust, the Certificate Administrator and the Trust Advisor, as applicable, of the reasonable fees and expenses to be incurred by the Trust, the Certificate Administrator and the Trust Advisor, as applicable, in connection with such vote (which fees and expenses will not constitute Additional Trust Expenses) and (iii) obtaining the consent (which shall be obtained prior to any solicitation of votes below) of the Controlling Class Representative during any Subordinate Control Period and any Collective Consultation Period (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, and such consent shall be deemed to have been granted if no objection is made within ten (10) Business Days following the Controlling Class Representative's receipt of the request for consent and, if







 granted or deemed granted, such consent cannot thereafter be revoked or withdrawn), the Certificate Administrator shall promptly provide written notice of the requested vote described in clause (i) of the prior sentence to all Certificateholders by (i) posting such notice on its internet website and including in the next Distribution Date Statement a statement that such request was received, and (ii) mail at their addresses appearing in the Certificate Register.  Upon the written direction of Holders of Certificates evidencing more than 75% of all the Voting Rights of the Certificates, the Trustee shall terminate all of the rights (other than the right to receive accrued and unpaid fees and expense reimbursements and the right to indemnification hereunder) and obligations of the Trust Advisor under this Agreement by notice in writing to the Trust Advisor; provided that if that written direction is not provided within 180 days of the initial request for a vote to terminate and replace the Trust Advisor, then that written direction will have no force and effect.  In addition, the Holders of Certificates evidencing more than 75% of all the Voting Rights of the Certificates may direct the Trustee not to replace the terminated Trust Advisor); provided that if at any time there is no Trust Advisor acting in such capacity, the provisions of this Agreement relating to the rights (other than the right to receive accrued and unpaid fees and expense reimbursements and the right to indemnification hereunder) and obligations of the Trust Advisor will have no force and effect; and provided, further, that, if the Holders of at least 25% of the Voting Rights of the Certificates subsequently request a vote to reinstate the role of Trust Advisor and appoint a new Trust Advisor under this Agreement, and the Holders of at least 75% of the Voting Rights of the Certificates vote in favor of such reinstatement and appointment, then a new Trust Advisor will be appointed and references to Trust Advisor in this Agreement will again be applicable.  The provisions set forth in the foregoing sentences of this Section 10.12(b) shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of the Certificateholders and the Trustee as between each other.  The Trust Advisor shall not have any cause of action based upon or arising from any breach or alleged breach of such provisions; provided that this sentence shall not affect the Trust Advisor's right to receive accrued and unpaid fees and expense reimbursements and the right to indemnification hereunder.  As between the Trust Advisor, on the one hand, and the Certificateholders, on the other, the Certificateholders shall be entitled in their sole discretion to vote for the termination or not vote for the termination of the Trust Advisor.



 (c)           If there are no Classes of Certificates outstanding other than the Control Eligible Certificates and the Class R Certificates, then the Holders of Certificates representing greater than 50% of the junior-most Class of Control Eligible Certificates outstanding may elect to terminate the Trust Advisor without payment of any termination fee.  Upon its receipt of notice from such Holders of their election to so terminate the Trust Advisor, the Trustee shall terminate all of the rights and obligations of the Trust Advisor under this Agreement by notice in writing to the Trust Advisor.  If the Trust Advisor is terminated pursuant to this Section 10.12(c), then no replacement Trust Advisor will be appointed.



 (d)           On or after the receipt by the Trust Advisor of written notice of termination pursuant to Section 10.12(a), Section 10.12(b) or Section 10.12(c), or the effectiveness of any resignation by the Trust Advisor pursuant to Section 10.8, all of its authority and power under this Agreement shall be terminated and, without limitation, the terminated Trust Advisor shall execute any and all documents and other instruments, and do or accomplish all other acts or things necessary or appropriate to effect the purposes of such notice of termination.  As soon as practicable, but in no event later than fifteen (15) Business Days (or such longer period of time as may be reasonably necessary to find a willing successor trust advisor if no







 willing successor trust advisor can be identified in such fifteen (15) Business Day period) after (1) the Trust Advisor resigns pursuant to Section 10.8 or (2) the Trustee delivers such written notice of termination to the Trust Advisor pursuant to Section 10.12(a) or Section 10.12(b), the Trustee shall appoint a successor Trust Advisor (to the extent a willing successor trust advisor can be identified) that is an Eligible Trust Advisor (which successor Trust Advisor may be an Affiliate of the Trustee) and shall be the recommended or proposed Trust Advisor in the case of a resignation pursuant to Section 10.8(b) or a termination pursuant to Section 10.12(b).  During any Subordinate Control Period and any Collective Consultation Period, the Controlling Class Representative shall have the right to consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, to any replacement Trust Advisor (except that such consent will be deemed to have been granted if no objection is made within ten (10) Business Days following the Controlling Class Representative's receipt of the request for consent and, if granted, such consent cannot thereafter be revoked or withdrawn).  If the Trustee is the successor Master Servicer or successor Special Servicer, neither the Trustee nor any of its Affiliates shall be the successor Trust Advisor.  If the termination of the Trust Advisor is pursuant to Section 10.12(b), and if the Holders of Certificates representing more than 75% of the aggregate Voting Rights of the Certificates so direct, then the Trustee shall not replace the terminated Trust Advisor (subject to the provisos to the third (3rd) sentence of Section 10.12(b)).  Except as contemplated by Section 10.12(b), and except for any consent rights of the Controlling Class Representative expressly set forth in this Article X, the appointment of the Trust Advisor shall not be subject to the vote, consent or approval of the Holder of any Class of Certificates.  The Trust Advisor shall not at any time be the Depositor, the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, a Seller or an Affiliate of any of them.  If any of such entities becomes the Trust Advisor, including by means of an affiliation arising after the date hereof, the Trust Advisor shall immediately resign, and the Trustee shall appoint a successor Trust Advisor subject to and in accordance with this Section 10.12(d).



 Upon any resignation or termination of the Trust Advisor and, if applicable, appointment of a successor Trust Advisor, the Trustee shall, as soon as possible, give written notice thereof to the Special Servicer, the Master Servicer, the Certificate Administrator (who shall promptly post such notice to the Certificateholder's Website pursuant to Section 5.4), the 17g-5 Information Provider (who shall promptly post such notice to the 17g-5 Information Provider's Website pursuant to Section 5.7), the Depositor, the Certificateholders and, during any Subordinate Control Period and any Collective Consultation Period, the Controlling Class Representative.  If the Trust Advisor resigns or is terminated for any reason, all of its rights and obligations under this Agreement shall terminate, other than any rights or obligations that accrued prior to the date of such termination (including the right to receive all fees, expenses and indemnities accrued and owing to it under this Agreement which shall be payable in accordance with the priorities and subject to the limitations set forth herein including, without limitation, Section 6.11).



 Section 10.13     Rights of the Holders of a B Note and Serviced Companion Loan.  With respect to each A/B Whole Loan (if any) and Loan Pair (if any), the holder of the B Note and the holder of the Serviced Companion Loan shall have such consent rights or consultation rights, if any, during the specified time periods, as are set forth in the related Intercreditor Agreement.







 Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Master Servicer or Special Servicer, as applicable, determines, in accordance with the Servicing Standard, that immediate action is necessary to protect the interest of the Certificateholders and the holder of any related B Note or Serviced Companion Loan (as a collective whole), then the Master Servicer or Special Servicer, as applicable may take any such action without waiting for the response of the holder of the B Note or holder of the Serviced Companion Loan provided for in the related Intercreditor Agreement.



 In addition, with respect to any A/B Whole Loan or Loan Pair, to the extent provided for in the related Intercreditor Agreement, the holder of the B Note or holder of the Serviced Companion Loan may direct the Master Servicer or Special Servicer, as applicable, to take, or to refrain from taking, such actions as the holder of the B Note or holder of the Serviced Companion Loan may deem advisable or as to which provision is otherwise made herein.  Upon reasonable request, to the extent provided for in the related Intercreditor Agreement, the Master Servicer or Special Servicer, as applicable, shall, with respect to any A/B Whole Loan or Loan Pair, provide the holder of the B Note or holder of the Serviced Companion Loan with any information in the Master Servicer's or Special Servicer's, as applicable, possession with respect to such matters, including its reasons for determining to take a proposed action.



 If the holder of the B Note or holder of the Serviced Companion Loan shall direct the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer to take any action (other than those provided for in the related Intercreditor Agreement or in this Agreement), the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer shall be entitled to receive reimbursement from collections on and other proceeds of the B Note or Serviced Companion Loan for (i) its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in taking such action and (ii) to the extent that such action constitutes an extraordinary action not in the ordinary course of administering and servicing such mortgage loan, other reasonable costs incurred by the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer in taking such action. The Master Servicer or the Special Servicer shall notify the holder of the B Note or holder of the Serviced Companion Loan, prior to taking the related action, if the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer anticipates that it will seek reimbursement therefor under the preceding sentence, and of the estimated amount of such reimbursement, and shall further notify the holder of the B Note or holder of the Serviced Companion Loan if it intends to obtain actual reimbursement in excess of the estimated amount.



 Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no advice, direction or objection from the holder of the B Note or holder of the Serviced Companion Loan, as contemplated by this Agreement, may (and the Master Servicer and Special Servicer, as applicable, shall ignore and act without regard to any such advice, direction or objection that the Master Servicer or Special Servicer, as applicable, has determined, in accordance with the Servicing Standard, will) (i) require or cause the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer to violate applicable law, the terms of any Mortgage Loan, any provision of this Agreement or the REMIC Provisions, including the Master Servicer's or the Special Servicer's obligation to act in accordance with the Servicing Standard, (ii) result in an Adverse REMIC Event with respect to any REMIC Pool or an Adverse Grantor Trust Event with respect to the Grantor Trust, (iii) expose the Trust, the Depositor, the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Certificate Administrator or the Trustee, or any of their respective Affiliates, officers, directors, employees or agents, to any material







 claim, suit or liability, or (iv) materially expand the scope of the Master Servicer's or Special Servicer's responsibilities under this Agreement.



 With respect to any B Note or Serviced Companion Loan, the Master Servicer (if the B Note or Serviced Companion Loan has not become a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan and the related Mortgaged Property has not become an REO Property) or the Special Servicer (if the B Note or Serviced Companion Loan has become a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan or the related Mortgaged Property has become an REO Property) shall prepare and make available (or to the extent required pursuant to the terms of the related Intercreditor Agreement, deliver) to the holder of such B Note or Serviced Companion Loan, the related Loan-Specific Directing Holder and the related Non-Directing Holder (or its designee or representative) all notices, reports, statements and communications to be delivered by the holder of the related Mortgage Loan under the Intercreditor Agreement, and shall perform all duties and obligations to be performed by a servicer and perform all servicing-related duties and obligations to be performed by the holder of the related Mortgage Loan pursuant to the related Intercreditor Agreement.



 If the holder of any Serviced Companion Loan notifies the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator, the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer of any changes in the name and contact information of the holder of such Serviced Companion Loan, the party receiving such information shall promptly notify the other such parties thereof.  The Trustee, the Certificate Administrator, the Custodian, the Master Servicer and the Special Servicer may each conclusively rely on the information so provided to it by any other such party regarding identity and/or contact information of the holder of any Serviced Companion Loan, and none of the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator, the Custodian, the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as applicable, shall have any liability for notices or reports not sent to the correct holder of any Serviced Companion Loan or any obligation to obtain the consent of or consult with the correct holder of any Serviced Companion Loan to the extent any other such party or the holder of such Serviced Companion Loan has not provided updated or correct information regarding the holder of such Serviced Companion Loan or has not provided the most recent identity and/or contact information regarding the holder of such Serviced Companion Loan to the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator, the Custodian, the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as applicable.



 Section 10.14     Rights of Non-Directing Holders.  With respect to each Loan Pair (as and to the extent provided for under the related Intercreditor Agreement), the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as applicable, shall:



 (a)           consult with the related Non-Directing Holder (or its designee or representative) on a strictly non-binding basis, to the extent that such Non-Directing Holder (or its designee or representative) requests consultation with respect to any "major decision" or "major action" set forth in the related Intercreditor Agreement or the implementation of any recommended actions outlined in an Asset Status Report relating to the Loan Pair, as applicable, and to consider alternative actions recommended by such Non-Directing Holder (or its designee or representative); provided, that, subject to the related Intercreditor Agreement, if the related Non-Directing Holder fails to respond within ten (10) Business Days from the delivery to the related Non-Directing Holder (or its designee or representative) of written notice of a proposed action, together with copies of the related notice, information or report, or any other







 communication relating to a proposed action, the Master Servicer or Special Servicer, as applicable, shall no longer be obligated to consult with the applicable Non-Directing Holder (or its designee or representative) (unless the Master Servicer or Special Servicer, as applicable, proposes a new course of action that is materially different from the action previously proposed, in which case such ten (10) Business Day period shall begin anew from the date of such proposal and delivery of all information relating thereto).  Notwithstanding the foregoing non-binding consultation rights of the Non-Directing Holder, the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as applicable, may take any "major decision" or "major action" set forth in the related Intercreditor Agreement or any action set forth in the Asset Status Report before the expiration of the aforementioned ten (10) Business Day period if the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as applicable, determines that immediate action with respect thereto is necessary to protect the interests of the Certificateholders and the holder of the related Serviced Companion Loan.  Unless otherwise specified in the related Intercreditor Agreement, neither the Master Servicer nor the Special Servicer shall be obligated at any time to follow or take any alternative actions recommended by the Non-Directing Holder; and



 (b)           in addition to the foregoing non-binding consultation rights, as and to the extent provided for in the related Intercreditor Agreement, the Non-Directing Holder shall have the right to annual conference calls with the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer upon reasonable notice and at times reasonably acceptable to the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as applicable, in which servicing issues related to the related A/B Whole Loan or Loan Pair, as applicable, are discussed.

 (b)           If on any date the Aggregate Stated Principal Balance of the Mortgage Loans is less than or equal to 1.0% of the initial Aggregate Stated Principal Balance of the Mortgage Loans as of the Cut-Off Date, the Master Servicer shall give the Trustee, the Custodian, the Certificate Administrator and the 17g-5 Information Provider notice of such date.







 The Certificate Administrator shall promptly forward such notice to the Trustee, the Custodian, the Depositor, the Holders of a majority of the most subordinate Class of REMIC III Regular Certificates or Exchangeable Certificates then outstanding (for this purpose considering each Class of the Class A-S, Class B and Class C Certificates together with the portion of the Class PST Certificates representing an interest in the EC REMIC III Regular Interest bearing the same alphabetic designation), the Special Servicer, the Master Servicer and the Holders of the Class R Certificates.  The Holders of a majority of the most subordinate Class of REMIC III Regular Certificates or Exchangeable Certificates then outstanding (for this purpose considering each Class of the Class A-S, Class B and Class C Certificates together with the portion of the Class PST Certificates representing an interest in the EC REMIC III Regular Interest bearing the same alphabetic designation), the Special Servicer, the Master Servicer and the Holder of Certificates representing a majority interest in the Class R Certificates, in such priority (and in the case of the Class R Certificateholders, a majority of the Class R Certificateholders), may purchase, in whole only, the Mortgage Loans (in the case of any A/B Whole Loan or Loan Pair, subject to the rights of the holder of the related B Note or Serviced Companion Loan provided for in the related Intercreditor Agreement) and any other property, if any, remaining in the Trust.  If any party desires to exercise such option, it will notify the Certificate Administrator who shall notify any party with a prior right to exercise such option.  If any party that has been provided notice by the Certificate Administrator (excluding the Depositor) notifies the Certificate Administrator within ten (10) Business Days after receiving notice of the proposed purchase that it wishes to purchase the assets of the Trust, then such party (or, if more than one of such parties notifies the Certificate Administrator that it wishes to purchase the assets of the Trust, the party with the first right to purchase the assets of the Trust) may purchase the assets of the Trust in accordance with this Agreement.  Upon the Certificate Administrator's receipt of the Termination Price set forth below, the Certificate Administrator shall promptly notify the Trustee and the Custodian in writing of its receipt thereof, and the Trustee shall thereupon direct the Custodian promptly to release or cause to be released to the Master Servicer for the benefit of the Person(s) exercising the option set forth in this Section 11.1(b) the Mortgage Files pertaining to the Mortgage Loans.  The "Termination Price" shall equal 100% of the aggregate Unpaid Principal Balances of the Mortgage Loans (other than REO Mortgage Loans and Mortgage Loans as to which a Final Recovery Determination has been made) on the day of such purchase plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon at the applicable Mortgage Rates (or Mortgage Rates less the Master Servicing Fee Rate if the Master Servicer is the purchaser), with respect to the Mortgage Loans to the Due Date for each Mortgage Loan ending in the Collection Period with respect to which such purchase occurs, plus unreimbursed Advances and interest on such unreimbursed Advances at the Advance Rate, and the fair market value of any REO Properties and other property remaining in REMIC I.  The Trustee shall consult with the Underwriters and the Initial Purchasers or their respective successors, as advisers, in order for the Trustee to determine whether the fair market value of the property constituting the Trust has been offered; provided that, if an Affiliate of any Underwriter or Initial Purchaser is exercising its right to purchase the Trust assets, the Trustee shall consult with the Special Servicer in order for the Trustee to determine whether the fair market value of the property constituting the Trust has been offered, provided that the Special Servicer is not an Affiliate of any Holder of Class R Certificates, the Master Servicer or the Trustee (the fees and expenses of such determination which shall be paid for by the buyer of the property constituting the Trust).  If the Trustee consults with any Underwriter or Initial Purchaser or their respective successors, or with the Special Servicer, in each case pursuant to the







 immediately preceding sentence, the Trustee shall be entitled to rely conclusively on any written confirmation given by such party as to whether the fair market value of the property constituting the Trust has been offered.  As a condition to the purchase of the Trust assets pursuant to this Section 11.1(b), the Person(s) exercising the option must deliver to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel, which shall be at the expense of such Person(s) stating that such termination will be a "qualified liquidation" under section 860F(a)(4) of the Code.  Such purchase shall be made in accordance with Section 11.3.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Trustee is required to determine whether an offer represents the fair market value of the property constituting the Trust, unless it is otherwise required to consult with any Underwriter or Initial Purchaser or their respective successors, or with the Special Servicer, in each case pursuant to this Section, the Trustee shall be permitted to designate an independent third party expert (the fees and expenses of which shall be paid for by the buyer of the property constituting the Trust) in real estate or commercial mortgage loan matters with at least five (5) years' experience in valuing commercial real estate assets similar to the property constituting the Trust, to determine whether the fair market value of the property constituting the Trust has been offered.  If the Trustee designates such a third party to make such determination, the Trustee shall be entitled to rely conclusively upon such third party's determination.



 (c)           [Reserved]



 (d)           Following the date on which the Class A-1, Class A-2, Class A-SB, Class A-3, Class A-4, Class A-S, Class X-A, Class B, Class PST, Class C, Class D and Class E Certificates are retired (and provided that there is only one Holder of the then outstanding Certificates (other than the Class R Certificates)), the Sole Certificateholder shall have the right to exchange all of its Certificates (other than the Class R Certificates) for all of the Mortgage Loans and each REO Property remaining in the Trust Fund as contemplated by Section 11.1(a)(iii) by giving written notice to all the parties hereto no later than 60 days prior to the anticipated date of exchange.  If the Sole Certificateholder elects to exchange all of its Certificates (other than the Class R Certificates)) for all of the Mortgage Loans and the Trust Fund's portion of each REO Property remaining in the Trust in accordance with the preceding sentence, such Sole Certificateholder, not later than the Distribution Date on which the final distribution on the Certificates is to occur, shall deposit in the Collection Account an amount in immediately available funds equal to all amounts due and owing to the Depositor, the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Custodian, the Trustee, the Trust Advisor and the Certificate Administrator hereunder through the date of the liquidation of the Trust Fund that may be withdrawn from the Collection Account pursuant to Section 5.2 or that may be withdrawn from the Distribution Account pursuant to Section 5.3, but only to the extent that such amounts are not already on deposit in the Collection Account.  In addition, the Servicer shall transfer all amounts required to be transferred to the Excess Interest Sub-Account on the Master Servicer Remittance Date related to such Distribution Date in which the final distribution on the Certificates is to occur from the Collection Account.  Upon confirmation that such final deposits have been made and following the surrender of all its Certificates (other than the Class R Certificates) on the final Distribution Date, the Certificate Administrator shall upon receipt of a Request for Release from the Master Servicer, release or cause to be released to the Sole Certificateholder or any designee thereof, the Mortgage Files for the remaining Mortgage Loans and shall execute all assignments, endorsements and other instruments furnished to it by the Sole Certificateholder as shall be necessary to effectuate transfer of the Mortgage Loans and REO Properties remaining in the







 Trust Fund, and the Trust Fund shall be liquidated in accordance with Section 11.2.  Solely for federal income tax purposes, the Sole Certificateholder shall be deemed to have purchased the assets of the REMIC I for an amount equal to the remaining Certificate Balance of the Principal Balance Certificates, plus accrued, unpaid interest with respect thereto, and the Certificate Administrator shall credit such amounts against amounts distributable in respect of such Certificates and REMIC I Interests.



 (e)           Upon the termination of the Trust, any Class H Specific Grantor Trust Assets held by the Grantor Trust shall be distributed to the Class H Certificateholders on a pro rata basis, whether or not the respective Certificate Balances of the Class H Certificates have been reduced to zero.



 (f)            Upon the sale of the A Note relating to an A/B Whole Loan by the Trust or the payment in full of such A Note, the related B Note shall no longer be subject to this Agreement and shall no longer be serviced by the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer.



 Section 11.2     Procedure Upon Termination of Trust.



 (a)           Notice of any termination pursuant to the provisions of Section 11.1, specifying the Distribution Date upon which the final distribution shall be made, shall be given promptly by the Certificate Administrator to the Trustee, the 17g-5 Information Provider, the Holders of the Class R Certificates, the REMIC III Regular Certificates and the Exchangeable Certificates mailed no later than ten (10) days prior to the date of such termination.  Such notice shall specify (A) the Distribution Date upon which final distribution on the Class R Certificates, the REMIC III Regular Certificates and the Exchangeable Certificates will be made, and upon presentation and surrender of such Certificates at the office or agency of the Certificate Registrar therein specified, and (B) that the Record Date otherwise applicable to such Distribution Date is not applicable, distribution being made only upon presentation and surrender of such Certificates at the office or agency of the Certificate Registrar therein specified.  The Certificate Administrator shall give such notice to the Depositor, the Trustee and the Certificate Registrar at the time such notice is given to Holders of such Certificates.  Upon any such termination, the duties of the Certificate Registrar with respect to the Class R Certificates, the REMIC III Regular Certificates and the Exchangeable Certificates shall terminate and the Trustee shall terminate, or request the Master Servicer and the Certificate Administrator to terminate, the Collection Account and the Distribution Account and any other account or fund maintained with respect to the Certificates, subject to the Certificate Administrator's obligation hereunder to hold all amounts payable to the Holders of the Class R Certificates, the REMIC III Regular Certificates and the Exchangeable Certificates in trust without interest pending such payment.



 (b)           If all of the Holders do not surrender their certificates evidencing the Class R Certificates, the REMIC III Regular Certificates and the Exchangeable Certificates for cancellation within three (3) months after the time specified in the above-mentioned written notice, then the Certificate Registrar shall give a second (2nd) written notice to the remaining Holders of such Certificates to surrender their Certificates evidencing such Certificates for cancellation and receive the final distribution with respect thereto.  If within one year after the second (2nd) notice any such Certificates shall not have been surrendered for cancellation, the Certificate Registrar may take appropriate steps to contact the remaining Holders of such







 Certificates concerning surrender of such Certificates, and the cost thereof shall be paid out of the amounts distributable to such Holders.  If within two (2) years after the second (2nd) notice any such Certificates shall not have been surrendered for cancellation, the Certificate Administrator shall, subject to applicable state law relating to escheatment, hold all amounts distributable to such Holders for the benefit of such Holders.  No interest shall accrue on any amount held by the Trustee and not distributed to a Holder of such Certificates due to such Certificateholder's failure to surrender its Certificate(s) for payment of the final distribution thereon in accordance with this Section.  Any money held by the Certificate Administrator pending distribution under this Section 11.2 after ninety (90) days after the adoption of a plan of complete liquidation shall be deemed for tax purposes to have been distributed from the REMIC Pools and shall be beneficially owned by the related Holder.



 Section 11.3     Additional Trust Termination Requirements.



 (a)           The Trust and each REMIC Pool shall be terminated in accordance with the following additional requirements, unless at the request of the Master Servicer or the Class R Certificateholders, as the case may be, the Trustee seeks, and the Certificate Administrator subsequently receives an Opinion of Counsel (at the expense of the Master Servicer or the Class R Certificateholders, as the case may be), addressed to the Depositor, the Trustee and the Certificate Administrator to the effect that the failure of the Trust to comply with the requirements of this Section 11.3 will not (i) result in the imposition of taxes on "prohibited transactions" on any REMIC Pool under the REMIC Provisions or (ii) cause any REMIC Pool to fail to qualify as a REMIC at any time that any Certificates are outstanding:



 (i)            Within eighty-nine (89) days prior to the time of the making of the final payment on the REMIC III Regular Certificates, the Exchangeable Certificates and the Class R Certificates, the Master Servicer shall prepare and the Trustee (on behalf of REMIC I, REMIC II or REMIC III) shall adopt a plan of complete liquidation of each REMIC Pool, meeting the requirements of a qualified liquidation under the REMIC Provisions, which plan need not be in any special form and the date of which, in general, shall be the date of the notice specified in Section 11.2(a) and shall be specified in a statement attached to the federal income tax return of each applicable REMIC Pool;



 (ii)           At or after the date of adoption of such a plan of complete liquidation and at or prior to the time of making of the final payment on the REMIC III Regular Certificates and the Exchangeable Certificates, the Trustee shall sell all of the assets of the Trust for cash at the Termination Price; provided that if the Holders of the Class R Certificates are purchasing the assets of the Trust or REMIC I, the amount to be paid by such Holders may be paid net of the amount to be paid to such Holders as final distributions on any Certificates held by such Holders;



 (iii)          At the time of the making of the final payment on the REMIC III Regular Interests, the Certificate Administrator shall distribute or credit, or cause to be distributed or credited, (A) to the Holders of the Class R Certificates all assets of REMIC I remaining after such final payment of the REMIC I Regular Interests, (B) to the Holders of the Class R Certificates all assets of REMIC II remaining after such final payment of the REMIC II Regular Interests and (C) to the Holders of the Class R Certificates all







 remaining assets of REMIC III (in each case other than cash retained to meet claims); and upon making of the final payment to all Class R Certificates of all remaining assets of each REMIC Pool, and the Trust shall terminate at that time; and



 (iv)          In no event may the final payment on the REMIC I Regular Interests, REMIC II Regular Interests or REMIC III Regular Interests, or the final distribution or credit to the Holders of the Class R Certificates, respectively, be made after the 89th day from the date on which the plan of complete liquidation is adopted.



 (b)           By their acceptance of the Class R Certificates, the Holders thereof hereby (i) authorize the Trustee to take such action as may be necessary to adopt a plan of complete liquidation of each REMIC Pool, and (ii) agree to take such other action as may be necessary to adopt a plan of complete liquidation of the Trust upon the written request of the Depositor, which authorization shall be binding upon all successor Class R Certificateholders.



 ARTICLE XII

 REMIC AND GRANTOR TRUST ADMINISTRATION



 The provisions of this Article XII shall apply to each REMIC Pool and the Grantor Trust, as applicable.



 Section 12.1     REMIC Administration.



 (a)           An election will be made by the Certificate Administrator on behalf of the Trustee to treat the segregated pool of assets consisting of the Mortgage Loans (other than Excess Interest payable thereon), such amounts with respect thereto as shall from time to time be held in the Collection Account, the Reserve Accounts and the Distribution Account (exclusive of the Excess Interest Sub-account), the Insurance Policies and any related amounts in the REO Account and, to the extent of the Trust's interest therein, any related REO Properties as a REMIC under the Code (such REMIC being herein designated as ''REMIC I''), other than any portion of the foregoing amounts allocable to a B Note or Serviced Companion Loan.  Such elections will be made on Form 1066 or other appropriate federal tax or information return or any appropriate state return for the taxable year ending on the last day of the calendar year in which the REMIC I Interests are issued.  For purposes of such election, the REMIC I Regular Interests shall be designated as the "regular interests" in REMIC I, and the REMIC I Residual Interest (which shall be evidenced by the Class R Certificates) shall be designated as the sole class of "residual interests" in REMIC I.



 An election will be made by the Certificate Administrator to treat the segregated pool of assets consisting of the REMIC I Regular Interests as a REMIC under the Code (such REMIC being herein designated as ''REMIC II'').  Such election will be made on Form 1066 or other appropriate federal tax or information return or any appropriate state return for the taxable year ending on the last day of the calendar year in which the REMIC II Interests are issued.  For the purposes of such election, the REMIC II Regular Interests shall be designated as the "regular interests" in REMIC II, and the REMIC II Residual Interest (which shall be evidenced by the Class R Certificates) shall be designated as the sole class of "residual interests" in REMIC II.







 An election will be made by the Certificate Administrator to treat the segregated pool of assets consisting of the REMIC II Regular Interests as a REMIC under the Code (such REMIC being herein designated as ''REMIC III'').  Such election will be made on Form 1066 or other appropriate federal tax or information return or any appropriate state return for the taxable year ending on the last day of the calendar year in which the REMIC III Interests are issued.  For purposes of such election, the Class A-1, Class A-2, Class A-SB, Class A-3, Class A-4, Class D, Class E, Class F and Class G Certificates, the EC REMIC III Regular Interests, the Class H REMIC III Regular Interest and the Class X REMIC III Regular Interests shall be designated as the "regular interests" in REMIC III, and the REMIC III Residual Interest (which shall be evidenced by the Class R Certificates) shall be designated as the sole class of "residual interests" in REMIC III.



 The Trustee and the Certificate Administrator shall not permit the creation of any "interests" (within the meaning of Section 860G of the Code) in any of the REMIC Pools other than the REMIC I Interests, the REMIC II Interests and the REMIC III Interests.



 (b)           The Closing Date is hereby designated as the "Startup Day" of each REMIC Pool within the meaning of Section 860G(a)(9) of the Code.



 (c)           The Certificate Administrator shall pay all routine tax related expenses (not including any taxes, however denominated, including any additions to tax, penalties and interest) of each REMIC Pool, excluding any professional fees or extraordinary expenses related to audits or any administrative or judicial proceedings with respect to each REMIC Pool that involve the Internal Revenue Service or state tax authorities.



 (d)           The Certificate Administrator shall cause to be prepared, signed, and timely filed with the Internal Revenue Service, on behalf of each REMIC Pool, an application for a taxpayer identification number for such REMIC Pool on Internal Revenue Service Form SS-4.  The Certificate Administrator, upon receipt from the Internal Revenue Service of the Notice of Taxpayer Identification Number Assigned, shall promptly forward a copy of such notice to the Depositor and the Master Servicer.  The Certificate Administrator shall prepare and file Form 8811 on behalf of each REMIC Pool and shall designate an appropriate Person to respond to inquiries by or on behalf of Certificateholders for original issue discount and related information in accordance with applicable provisions of the Code.



 (e)           The Certificate Administrator shall prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and filed, all of each REMIC Pool's federal and state income or franchise tax and information returns as such REMIC Pool's direct representative, and the Certificate Administrator (or, if necessary, the Trustee) shall sign such returns; the expenses of preparing and filing such returns shall be borne by the Certificate Administrator, except that if additional state tax returns are required to be filed in more than three (3) states, the Certificate Administrator shall be entitled, with respect to any such additional filings, to (i) be paid a reasonable fee and (ii) receive its reasonable costs and expenses, both as amounts reimbursable pursuant to Section 5.2(a)(I)(vi) hereof.  Each of the Depositor, the Master Servicer and the Special Servicer shall provide on a timely basis to the Certificate Administrator or its designee such information with respect to the Trust or any REMIC Pool as is in its possession, which the Depositor, the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as the case may be, has received or







 prepared by virtue of its role as Depositor, Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as the case may be, hereunder and reasonably requested by the Certificate Administrator to enable it to perform its obligations under this subsection, and the Certificate Administrator shall be entitled to conclusively rely on such information in the performance of its obligations hereunder.  The Depositor shall indemnify the Trust, the Trustee and the Certificate Administrator for any liability or assessment against any of them or cost or expense (including attorneys' fees) incurred by them resulting from any error in any of such tax or information returns resulting from errors in the information provided by the Depositor or caused by the negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith of the Depositor in providing any information for which the Depositor is responsible for preparing.  The Master Servicer and the Special Servicer shall indemnify the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator and the Depositor for any liability or assessment against the Trustee, the Depositor, the Certificate Administrator or any REMIC Pool and any expenses incurred in connection with such liability or assessment (including attorneys' fees) resulting from any error in any of such tax or information returns resulting from errors in the information provided by the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as the case may be, or caused by the negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith of the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as the case may be.  The Certificate Administrator shall indemnify the Master Servicer, the Depositor or any REMIC Pool for any expense incurred by the Master Servicer, the Depositor and any REMIC Pool resulting from any error in any of such tax or information returns resulting from errors in the preparation of such returns caused by the negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith of the Certificate Administrator.  Each indemnified party shall immediately notify the indemnifying party or parties of the existence of a claim for indemnification under this Section 12.1(e), and provide the indemnifying party or parties, at the expense of such indemnifying party or parties, an opportunity to contest the tax or assessment or expense giving rise to such claim, provided that the failure to give such notification shall not affect the indemnification rights in favor of any REMIC Pool under this Section 12.1(e).  Any such indemnification shall survive the resignation or termination of the Master Servicer, the Certificate Administrator or the Special Servicer, or the termination of this Agreement.



 (f)           The Certificate Administrator shall perform on behalf of each REMIC Pool all reporting and other tax compliance duties that are the responsibility of such REMIC Pool under the Code, the REMIC Provisions, or other compliance guidance issued by the Internal Revenue Service or any state or local taxing authority.  Among its other duties, the Certificate Administrator shall provide (i) to the Internal Revenue Service or other Persons (including, but not limited to, the Transferor of a Class R Certificate, a Disqualified Organization or an agent that has acquired such Class R Certificate on behalf of a Disqualified Organization) such information as is necessary for the application of any tax relating to the transfer of a Class R Certificate to any Disqualified Organization and (ii) to the Certificateholders such information or reports as are required by the Code or the REMIC Provisions.



 (g)           The Certificate Administrator shall forward to the Depositor copies of quarterly and annual REMIC tax returns and Internal Revenue Service Form 1099 information returns and such other information within the control of the Certificate Administrator as the Depositor may reasonably request in writing.  Moreover, the Certificate Administrator shall forward to each Certificateholder such forms and furnish such information within its control as are required by the Code to be furnished to them, shall prepare and file with the appropriate state authorities as may to the actual knowledge of a Responsible Officer of the Certificate







 Administrator be required by applicable law and shall prepare and disseminate to Certificateholders Internal Revenue Service Forms 1099 (or otherwise furnish information within the control of the Certificate Administrator) to the extent required by applicable law.  The Certificate Administrator will make available to any Certificateholder any tax related information required to be made available to Certificateholders pursuant to the Code and any regulations thereunder.



 (h)           The Holder of more than 50% of the Percentage Interests in the Class R Certificates (or of the greatest percentage of the Class R Certificates if no Holder holds more than 50% thereof) shall be the Tax Matters Person for each of REMIC I, REMIC II and REMIC III.  The duties of the Tax Matters Person for each of the REMIC Pools are hereby delegated to the Certificate Administrator, and each Class R Certificateholder, by acceptance of its Class R Certificate, agrees, on behalf of itself and all successor holders of such Class R Certificate, to such delegation to the Certificate Administrator as their agent and attorney in fact.  If the Code or applicable regulations prohibits the Certificate Administrator (or, if necessary, the Trustee) from signing any applicable Internal Revenue Service, court or other administrative documents or from acting as Tax Matters Person (as an agent or otherwise), the Certificate Administrator shall take whatever action is necessary for the signing of such documents and designation of a Tax Matters Person, including the designation of the Holder of more than 50% of the Percentage Interests in the Class R Certificates (or of the greatest percentage of the Class R Certificates if no Holder holds more than 50% thereof).  The Certificate Administrator shall not be required to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any other financial liability in the performance of its duties hereunder or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers (except to the extent of the ordinary expenses of performing its duties under this Agreement), if it shall have reasonable grounds for believing that repayment of such funds or adequate indemnity against such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to it.



 (i)           The Trustee, the Certificate Administrator, the Custodian, the Holders of the Class R Certificates, the Master Servicer and the Special Servicer shall each exercise reasonable care, to the extent within its control, and with respect to each of the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator, the Custodian, the Master Servicer and the Special Servicer, within the scope of its express duties, and shall each act in accordance with this Agreement and the REMIC Provisions in order to create and maintain the status of each REMIC Pool as a REMIC for so long as any REMIC III Regular Certificates or EC REMIC III Regular Interest are outstanding and the Grantor Trust as a grantor trust for so long as any Class H Certificates or Exchangeable Certificates are outstanding.



 (j)           The Trustee, the Certificate Administrator, the Custodian, the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer and the Holders of Class R Certificates shall not take any action or fail to take any action or cause any REMIC Pool to take any action or fail to take any action if any of such Persons knows or could, upon the exercise of reasonable diligence, know, that, under the REMIC Provisions such action or failure, as the case may be, could (i) endanger the status of any REMIC Pool as a REMIC (ii) result in the imposition of a tax upon any REMIC Pool (including but not limited to the tax on "prohibited transactions" as defined in Code Section 860F(a)(2)) or (iii) endanger the status of the Grantor Trust as a grantor trust unless the Trustee and the Certificate Administrator have received an Opinion of Counsel (at the expense of the party seeking to take such action) to the effect that the contemplated action will not endanger







 such status or result in the imposition of such a tax.  Any action required under this Section which would result in an unusual or unexpected expense shall be undertaken at the expense of the party requiring the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator, the Custodian or the Holders of the Class R Certificates to undertake such action.



 (k)           If any tax is imposed on any REMIC Pool, including, without limitation, "prohibited transactions" taxes as defined in Section 860F(a)(2) of the Code, any tax on "net income from foreclosure property" as defined in Section 860G(c) of the Code, any taxes on contributions to any REMIC Pool after the Startup Day pursuant to Section 860G(d) of the Code, and any other tax imposed by the Code or any applicable provisions of state or local tax laws (other than any tax permitted to be incurred by the Special Servicer pursuant to Section 9.14(e)), then such tax, together with all incidental costs and expenses (including, without limitation, penalties and reasonable attorneys' fees), shall be charged to and paid by:  (i) the Certificate Administrator, if such tax arises out of or results from a breach of any of its obligations under this Agreement; (ii) the Special Servicer, if such tax arises out of or results from a breach by the Special Servicer of any of its obligations under this Agreement; (iii) the Master Servicer, if such tax arises out of or results from a breach by the Master Servicer of any of its obligations under this Agreement; and (iv) the Trust in all other instances.  Any tax permitted to be incurred by the Special Servicer pursuant to Section 9.14(e) shall be charged to and paid by the Trust from the net income generated on the related REO Property.  Any such amounts payable by the Trust in respect of taxes shall be paid by the Certificate Administrator out of amounts on deposit in the Distribution Account.



 (l)            The Certificate Administrator and, to the extent that books and records are maintained by the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer in the normal course of its business, the Master Servicer and the Special Servicer shall, for federal income tax purposes, maintain books and records with respect to each REMIC Pool on a calendar year and on an accrual basis.  The books and records must be sufficient concerning the nature and amount of each REMIC Pool's investments to show that such REMIC Pool has complied with the REMIC Provisions.



 (m)          None of the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator, the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer shall enter into any arrangement by which any REMIC Pool will receive a fee or other compensation for services.



 (n)           In order to enable the Certificate Administrator to perform its duties as set forth herein, the Depositor shall provide, or cause to be provided, to the Certificate Administrator within ten (10) days after the Closing Date all information or data that the Certificate Administrator reasonably determines to be relevant for tax purposes on the valuations and offering prices of the Certificates, including, without limitation, the yield, prepayment assumption, issue prices and projected cash flows of the Certificates, as applicable, and the projected cash flows of the Mortgage Loans.  Thereafter, the Depositor shall provide to the Certificate Administrator or its designee, promptly upon request therefor, any such additional information or data within the Depositor's possession or knowledge that the Certificate Administrator may, from time to time, reasonably request in order to enable the Certificate Administrator to perform its duties as set forth herein.  The Certificate Administrator is hereby directed to use any and all such information or data provided by the Depositor in the preparation of all federal and state income or franchise tax and information returns and reports for each

 REMIC or of the regular interests therein, (B) affect the distribution of interest or principal on the Certificates, (C) result in the encumbrance of the assets transferred or assigned to any REMIC Pool (except pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement) or (D) cause any REMIC Pool to be subject to a tax on "prohibited transactions" or "prohibited contributions" or other tax pursuant to the REMIC Provisions.

 (b)           The EC REMIC III Regular Interests shall be held in the Grantor Trust and have been placed in the Grantor Trust through the efforts of the Underwriters.

At all times, the Class A-S, Class B and Class C Certificates shall represent beneficial ownership interests in the Class A-S Percentage Interest, the Class B Percentage Interest and the Class C Percentage Interest, respectively, in the Class A-S REMIC III Regular Interest, Class B REMIC III Regular Interest and Class C REMIC III Regular Interest, respectively.

 (c)           [Reserved]



 (d)           Under no circumstances may the Certificate Administrator vary the assets of the Grantor Trust so as to take advantage of variations in the market so as to improve the rate of return of Holders of the Class H Certificates or any Class of Exchangeable Certificates.  The Certificate Administrator shall be deemed to hold and shall account for the assets of the Grantor Trust separate and apart from the assets of REMIC I, REMIC II and REMIC III created hereunder.



 (e)           The parties intend that the portions of the Trust consisting of the Grantor Trust shall constitute, and that the affairs of the Trust (exclusive of the REMIC Pools) shall be conducted so as to qualify such portion as, a "grantor trust" under the Code, as an "investment trust" under Treasury Regulations Section 301.7701-4(c), and as a "domestic trust" under Treasury Regulations Section 301.7701-7, and the provisions hereof shall be interpreted consistently with this intention.  In furtherance of such intention, the Certificate Administrator shall furnish or cause to be furnished to Holders of the Class H Certificates and any Class of Exchangeable Certificates and shall file, or cause to be filed with the Internal Revenue Service, Form 1041 (or, if the Grantor Trust is a WHFIT, information will be provided on Form 1099) or such other form as may be applicable, at the time and in the manner required by the Code, indicating their respective shares of income and deductions with respect to such grantor trust, as such amounts accrue or are received, as the case may be.



 (f)           The Grantor Trust is a WHFIT that is a WHMT.



 Section 12.6     Grantor Trust Reporting Requirements.



 (a)           The Certificate Administrator will report as required under the WHFIT Regulations to the extent such information that is reasonably necessary to enable the Certificate Administrator to do so, and that is not already in its possession, is provided to the Certificate Administrator on a timely basis.  The Certificate Administrator is hereby directed to assume that Depository is the only "middleman" as defined by the WHFIT Regulations unless the Depositor provides the Certificate Administrator with the identities of other "middlemen" that are







 Certificateholders.  The Certificate Administrator shall be entitled to rely on the first (1st) sentence of this paragraph and shall be entitled to indemnification in accordance with the terms of this Agreement if the Internal Revenue Service makes a determination that the first (1st) sentence of this paragraph is incorrect.



 (b)           The Certificate Administrator, in its discretion, shall report required WHFIT information using either the cash or accrual method, except to the extent the WHFIT Regulations specifically require a different method.  The Certificate Administrator shall be under no obligation to determine whether any Certificateholder uses the cash or accrual method.  The Certificate Administrator shall make available WHFIT information to Certificateholders annually.  In addition, the Certificate Administrator shall not be responsible or liable for providing subsequently amended, revised or updated information to any Certificateholder, unless requested by the Certificateholder.



 (c)           The Certificate Administrator shall not be liable for failure to meet the reporting requirements of the WHFIT Regulations nor for any penalties thereunder if such failure is due to:  (i) the lack of reasonably necessary information that is not already in its possession being provided to the Certificate Administrator, or (ii) incomplete, inaccurate or untimely information being provided to the Certificate Administrator.  Each owner of a class of securities representing, in whole or in part, beneficial ownership of an interest in a WHFIT, by acceptance of its interest in such class of securities, will be deemed to have agreed to provide the Certificate Administrator with information regarding any sale of such securities, including the price, amount of proceeds and date of sale.  Absent receipt of information regarding any sale of Certificates, including the price, amount of proceeds and date of sale from the beneficial owner thereof or the Depositor, the Certificate Administrator shall assume there is no secondary market trading of WHFIT interests.



 (d)           To the extent required by the WHFIT Regulations, the Certificate Administrator shall use reasonable efforts to publish on an appropriate website the CUSIPs for the Certificates that represent ownership of a WHFIT.  The CUSIPs so published will represent the Rule 144A CUSIPs.  The Certificate Administrator shall make reasonable good faith efforts to keep the website accurate and updated to the extent CUSIPs have been received.  Absent the receipt of a CUSIP, the Certificate Administrator will use a reasonable identifier number in lieu of a CUSIP.  The Certificate Administrator shall not be liable for investor reporting delays that result from the receipt of inaccurate or untimely CUSIP information.

Form 10-D requires the registrant to indicate (by checking "yes" or "no") that it "(1) has filed all reports required to be filed by Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act during the preceding 12 months (or for such shorter period that the registrant was required to file such reports), and (2) has been subject to such filing requirements for the past 90 days."  The Depositor hereby instructs the Certificate Administrator, with respect to each Form 10-D, to check "yes" for each item unless the Certificate Administrator has received prior written notice (which may be furnished electronically) from the Depositor that the answer should be "no" for an item which notice shall be delivered to the Certificate Administrator no later than the end of business on the 5th calendar day after the related Distribution Date.  The Certificate Administrator shall (a) file such Form 10-D not later than 5:30 pxxPDmxxPD (New York City time) on the 15th calendar day after the related Distribution Date or (b) use commercially reasonable best efforts to file such Form 10-D, if the Certificate Administrator received the signed Form 10-D after the signing deadline set forth in Section 13.14, not later than 5:30 pxxPDmxxPD (New York City time) on the 15th calendar day after the related Distribution Date; provided that if the Certificate Administrator cannot file the Form 10-D prior to the deadline set forth in the immediately preceding clause (b), the Certificate Administrator shall file such Form 10-D as soon as possible thereafter.

After filing with the Commission, the Certificate Administrator shall promptly, pursuant to Section 5.4, make available on its internet website a final executed copy of each Form 10-D







 prepared and filed by the Certificate Administrator.  The parties to this Agreement acknowledge (and each Additional Servicer and each Servicing Function Participant shall be required to acknowledge) that the performance by the Certificate Administrator of its duties under this Section 13.4 related to the timely preparation and filing of Form 10-D is contingent upon such parties (and, to the extent applicable, any Additional Servicer or Servicing Function Participant) observing all applicable deadlines in the performance of their duties under this Section 13.4.  The Certificate Administrator shall have no liability for any loss, expense, damage, claim arising out of or with respect to any failure to properly prepare, arrange for execution or file such Form 10-D where such failure results from the Certificate Administrator's inability or failure to receive on a timely basis any information from any other party hereto needed to prepare, arrange for execution or file such Form 10-D, not resulting from its own negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct.

On or prior to 5:30 pxxPDmxxPD (New York City time) on the 90th calendar day after the end of each fiscal year of the Trust or such earlier date as may be required by the Exchange Act (the "10-K Filing Deadline") (it being understood that the fiscal year for the Trust ends on December 31st of each year), commencing in March 2014, the Certificate Administrator shall prepare and file on behalf of the Trust a Form 10-K, in form and substance as required by the Exchange Act.

 For so long as the Trust, and, with respect to any Serviced Companion Loan, the trust in the related Other Securitization, are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act,







 no later than March 7th of each year subsequent to the fiscal year that the Trust is subject to the Exchange Act reporting requirements, commencing in 2014, each Person identified on Schedule XII shall be required to provide to the Depositor (or, with respect to any Serviced Companion Loan that is deposited into an Other Securitization, the depositor and the trustee in such Other Securitization) and the Certificate Administrator, to the extent known by such Person, the form and substance of the corresponding Additional Form 10-K Disclosure as set forth on Schedule XII, if applicable, and in a form that is readily convertible to an EDGAR-compatible form (to the extent available to such party in such format), or in such other form as otherwise agreed by the Depositor, the Certificate Administrator and such Person.  Any such Additional Form 10-K Disclosure to be delivered to the Certificate Administrator shall be delivered to it via email at cts.sec.notifications@wellsfargo.com.  Each Person set forth on Schedule XII hereto shall include with such Additional Form 10-K Disclosure an Additional Disclosure Notification in the form attached hereto as Schedule XIV.  The Certificate Administrator shall, at any time prior to filing the related Form 10-K, provide prompt notice to the Depositor to the extent the Certificate Administrator is notified of an event reportable on Form 10-K for which it has not received the necessary Additional Form 10-K Disclosure from such party.  The Certificate Administrator has no duty under this Agreement to monitor or enforce the performance by the parties listed on Schedule XII of their duties under this paragraph or to proactively solicit or procure from such parties any Additional Form 10-K Disclosure information.  Unless otherwise directed by the Depositor, and subject to any comments received to such disclosure from the Depositor by March 15th, the Certificate Administrator shall include the form and substance of the Additional Form 10-K Disclosure on the related Form 10-K.  The Depositor will be responsible for any reasonable fees charged and out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Certificate Administrator in connection with including any Additional Form 10-K Disclosure on Form 10-K pursuant to this paragraph.  Any notice delivered to the Certificate Administrator pursuant to this paragraph shall be delivered by facsimile to (410) 715-2380 and by email to cts.sec.notifications@wellsfargo.com, or such other address as may hereafter be furnished by the Certificate Administrator to the other parties in writing.



 On or prior to the end of business on March 23rd (or, if such day is not a Business Day, the immediately preceding Business Day), the Certificate Administrator shall prepare and deliver electronically a draft copy of the Form 10-K to the Depositor for review.  No later than 5:00 pxxPDmxxPD (New York City time) on the 3rd Business Day prior to the 10-K Filing Deadline, a senior officer in charge of securitization of the Depositor shall sign the Form 10-K and return an electronic or fax copy of such signed Form 10-K (with an original executed hard copy to follow by overnight mail) to the Certificate Administrator.  Form 10-K requires the registrant to indicate (by checking "yes" or "no") that it "(1) has filed all reports required to be filed by Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act during the preceding 12 months (or for such shorter period that the registrant was required to file such reports), and (2) has been subject to such filing requirements for the past 90 days."  The Depositor hereby instructs the Certificate Administrator, with respect to each Form 10-K, to check "yes" for each item unless the Certificate Administrator has received prior written notice (which may be furnished electronically) from the Depositor that the answer should be "no" for an item which notice shall be delivered to the Certificate Administrator no later than 5:00 pxxPDmxxPD (New York City time) on the 15th calendar day of March in any year in which the Trust is required to file a Form 10-K.  The Certificate Administrator shall be entitled to rely on such representations in preparing, executing and/or filing any Form 10-K.  If a Form 10-K cannot be filed on time or if a previously filed Form 10-K needs to be







 amended, the Certificate Administrator will follow the procedures set forth in Section 13.8(b).  After filing with the Commission, the Certificate Administrator shall, pursuant to Section 5.4, make available on its internet website a final executed copy of each Form 10-K prepared and filed by the Certificate Administrator.  The signing party at the Depositor can be contacted at the address identified in Section 14.5.  The parties to this Agreement acknowledge (and each Additional Servicer and each Servicing Function Participant shall be required to acknowledge) that the performance by the Certificate Administrator of its duties under this Section 13.5 related to the timely preparation and filing of Form 10-K is contingent upon such parties (and, to the extent applicable, any Additional Servicer or Servicing Function Participant) observing all applicable deadlines in the performance of their duties under this Article XIII.  The Certificate Administrator shall have no liability with respect to any failure to properly prepare, arrange for execution or file such Form 10-K resulting from the Certificate Administrator's inability or failure to receive on a timely basis any information from any other party hereto needed to prepare, arrange for execution or file such Form 10-K on a timely basis, not resulting from its own negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct.  Any notices or draft Form 10-K delivered to the Depositor pursuant to this Section 13.5 shall be delivered by email to cmbs_filings@morganstanley.com, or such other address as may hereafter be furnished by the Depositor to the other parties in writing.



 If a Form 10-K is permitted to be filed notwithstanding any missing information for inclusion therein, the Certificate Administrator shall nonetheless file such Form 10-K and, if Regulation AB (or Form 10-K itself) permits the inclusion of an explanation why such information is missing, the Certificate Administrator shall include such explanation of the circumstances (such explanation to be based solely on such notice regarding the same as may have been delivered to the Certificate Administrator by the person responsible for the missing information).



 Section 13.6      Sarbanes-Oxley Certification.



 Each Form 10-K shall include a certification (the "Sarbanes-Oxley Certification"), exactly as set forth in Exhibit P-1 attached hereto, required to be included therewith pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.  Each Reporting Servicer shall provide, and each Reporting Servicer shall (a) use commercially reasonable efforts to cause each Servicing Function Participant (other than any party to this Agreement) with which it has entered into a servicing relationship on or prior to the Closing Date with respect to the Mortgage Loans and (b) cause each Servicing Function Participant (other than any party to this Agreement) with which it has entered into a servicing relationship after the Closing Date with respect to the Mortgage Loans to provide, to the Person who signs the Sarbanes-Oxley Certification (the "Certifying Person"), by noon (New York City time) on March 10th (with no grace period) of each year subsequent to the fiscal year in which the Trust is subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, a certification (each, a "Performance Certification"), in the form attached hereto as Exhibit P-2, upon which the Certifying Person, the entity for which the Certifying Person acts as an officer, and such entity's officers, directors and Affiliates (collectively with the Certifying Person, the "Certification Parties") can reasonably rely.  The senior officer in charge of securitization of the Depositor shall serve as the Certifying Person on behalf of the Trust.  Such officer of the Certifying Person can be contacted at the address identified in Section 14.5.   If any Reporting Servicer is terminated or resigns pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, or any applicable sub-servicing agreement or







 primary servicing agreement, as the case may be, such Reporting Servicer shall provide a Performance Certification and a reliance certificate to the Certifying Person pursuant to this Section 13.6 with respect to the period of time it was subject to this Agreement or the applicable sub-servicing or primary servicing agreement, as the case may be.



 Each Performance Certification shall include a reasonable reliance provision enabling the Certification Parties to rely upon each (i) annual compliance statement (as applicable) provided pursuant to Section 13.9, (ii) annual report on assessment of compliance with Servicing Criteria provided pursuant to Section 13.10 and (iii) registered public accounting firm attestation report provided pursuant to Section 13.11 and shall include a certification that each such annual report on assessment of compliance discloses any material instances of noncompliance described to the registered public accountants of such Reporting Servicer to enable such accountants to render the attestation provided for in Section 13.11.



 If any Serviced Companion Loan is deposited into a commercial mortgage securitization, and the applicable Reporting Servicer is provided with timely and complete contact information for the parties to the Other Securitization and the person signing the Other Securitization's Sarbanes-Oxley Certification, such Reporting Servicer shall provide to the Person who signs the Sarbanes-Oxley Certification with respect to an Other Securitization a Performance Certification (which shall address the matters contained in the Performance Certification, but solely with respect to the related Serviced Companion Loan), upon which such certifying person, the entity for which the certifying person acts as an officer, and such entity's officers, directors and Affiliates can reasonably rely.  With respect to any Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan serviced under a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan Pooling and Servicing Agreement, the Master Servicer shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to procure a Sarbanes-Oxley back-up certification from the Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan Master Servicer, Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan Special Servicer, Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan Certificate Administrator, Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan Custodian and the Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan Trustee in form and substance similar to a Performance Certification or in the form specified in the Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan Pooling and Servicing Agreement.  The Master Servicer shall promptly forward to the Certificate Administrator and the Depositor any such Sarbanes-Oxley back-up certification received by the Master Servicer.

Any disclosure or information related to a Reportable Event or that is otherwise required to be included on Form 8-K ("Form 8-K Disclosure Information") shall, pursuant to the paragraph immediately below, be reported by any party set forth on Schedule XIII to which such Reportable Event relates and such Form 8-K Disclosure Information shall be directed to the Depositor and the Certificate Administrator for approval by the Depositor.  The Certificate Administrator will have no duty or liability for any failure hereunder to determine or prepare any Form 8-K Disclosure Information (other than such







 Form 8-K Disclosure Information which is to be reported by it as set forth on Schedule XIII) absent such reporting, direction and approval.



 As set forth on Schedule XIII hereto, for so long as the Trust, and, with respect to any Serviced Companion Loan, the trust in the related Other Securitization, are subject to the Exchange Act reporting requirements, no later than noon (New York City time) on the 2nd Business Day after the occurrence of a Reportable Event the applicable Person identified on such Schedule XIII shall be required to provide written notice to the Depositor (or with respect to any Serviced Companion Loan that is deposited into an Other Securitization, the depositor and the trustee in such Other Securitization) and the Certificate Administrator of, to the extent known by such Person, the form and substance of the corresponding Form 8-K Disclosure Information, as set forth on Schedule XIII, if applicable, and in a form that is readily convertible to an EDGAR-compatible form (to the extent available to such party in such format), or in such other form as otherwise agreed by the Depositor, the Certificate Administrator and such Party.  Each Person set forth on Schedule XIII hereto shall include with such Form 8-K Disclosure Information an Additional Disclosure Notification in the form attached hereto as Schedule XIV.

Any notice delivered to the Certificate Administrator pursuant to this paragraph shall be delivered by facsimile to (410) 715-2380 and by email to cts.sec.notifications@wellsfargo.com, or such other address as may hereafter be furnished by the Certificate Administrator to the other parties in writing.



 No later than noon (New York City time) on the 3rd Business Day after the Reportable Event, the Certificate Administrator shall prepare the Form 8-K.  No later than the end of business on the 3rd Business Day after the Reportable Event, the Depositor (or with respect to any Serviced Companion Loan that is deposited into an Other Securitization, the depositor in such Other Securitization) shall sign the Form 8-K.  If so directed by the Depositor, the Certificate Administrator shall (a) file such Form 8-K not later than 5:30 pxxPDmxxPD (New York City time) on the 4th Business Day after the related Reportable Event or (b) use reasonable best efforts to file such Form 8-K, if the Certificate Administrator received the signed Form 8-K after the end of business on the 3rd Business Day after the Reportable Event, not later than 5:30 pm (New York City time) on the 4th Business Day after the related Reportable Event; provided that if the Certificate Administrator cannot file the Form 8-K prior to the deadline set forth in the immediately preceding clause (b), the Certificate Administrator shall file such Form 8-K as soon as possible thereafter.  If a Form 8-K cannot be filed on time or if a previously filed Form 8-K needs to be amended, the Certificate Administrator will follow the procedures set forth in Section 13.8(b).  After filing with the Commission, the Certificate Administrator will, pursuant to Section 5.4, make available on its internet website a final executed copy of each Form 8-K prepared and filed by the Certificate Administrator.  The parties to this Agreement acknowledge (and each Additional Servicer and each Servicing Function Participant shall be required to acknowledge) that the performance by the Certificate Administrator of its duties under this Section 13.7 related to the timely preparation and filing of Form 8-K is contingent upon such







 parties (and, to the extent applicable, any Additional Servicer or Servicing Function Participant) observing all applicable deadlines in the performance of their duties under this Section 13.7.  The Certificate Administrator shall have no liability for any loss, expense, damage, claim arising out of or with respect to any failure to properly prepare and/or timely file such Form 8-K, where such failure results from the Certificate Administrator's inability or failure to receive, on a timely basis, any information from any other party hereto needed to prepare, arrange for execution or file such Form 8-K, not resulting from its own negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct; provided that the Certificate Administrator shall prepare, arrange for execution and file such Form 8-K where such information from such other party is not received on a timely basis or not provided by such other party.  Any notices or draft Form 8-K delivered to the Depositor pursuant to this Section 13.7 shall be delivered by email to cmbs_filings@morganstanley.com, or such other address as may hereafter be furnished by the Depositor to the other parties in writing.

 Section 13.8      Suspension of Exchange Act Filings; Incomplete Exchange Act Filings; Amendments to Exchange Act Reports.



 (a)           On or before January 30 of the first year in which the Certificate Administrator is able to do so under applicable law, the Certificate Administrator, at the direction of the Depositor, shall prepare and file any form necessary to be filed with the Commission to suspend reporting in respect of the Trust under the Exchange Act.  After the filing of any such form, the obligations of the parties to this Agreement under Sections 13.2(b), 13.4, 13.5, 13.6 and 13.7 shall be suspended for so long as neither the Trust nor, with respect to any Serviced Companion Loan, the trust in the related Other Securitization, is subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act.  The Certificate Administrator shall provide each Reporting Servicer and each Seller with prompt written notice (which notice may be sent via facsimile or by email) if the Certificate Administrator files any such forms that effectuates the suspension of the Trust's Exchange Act reporting obligations pursuant to this Section 13.8(a).



 (b)           The Certificate Administrator shall promptly notify the Depositor (which notice may be sent by facsimile or by email and which shall include the identity of those Reporting Servicers who did not deliver such information) and each Reporting Servicer that failed to deliver such information required to be delivered by it under this Agreement, if all, or any portion of, any required disclosure information to be included in any Form 8-K, Form 10-D







 or Form 10-K required to be filed pursuant to this Agreement is not delivered to it within the delivery deadlines set forth in this Agreement (including annual compliance statements pursuant to Section 13.9, annual reports on assessment of compliance with servicing criteria pursuant to Section 13.10 and attestation reports pursuant to Section 13.11).  If the Certificate Administrator is unable to timely file with the Commission all or any required portion of any Form 8-K, Form 10-D or Form 10-K required to be filed by this Agreement because required disclosure information either was not delivered to it or was delivered to it after the delivery deadlines set forth in this Agreement or for any other reason, the Certificate Administrator shall promptly notify the Depositor (which may be sent by facsimile or by email, and which notice shall include the identity of those Reporting Servicers who either did not deliver such information or delivered such information to it after the delivery deadlines set forth in this Agreement) and each Reporting Servicer that failed to make such delivery.  In the case of Form 10-D and Form 10-K, each such Reporting Servicer shall reasonably cooperate with the Depositor and the Certificate Administrator to prepare and file a Form 12b-25 and a Form 10-D/A and Form 10-K/A as applicable, pursuant to Rule 12b-25 of the Exchange Act, which forms shall be filed no later than one calendar day after the original due date for the related Form 10-D or Form 10-K, as applicable.  In the case of Form 8-K, the Certificate Administrator shall, upon receipt of all required Form 8-K Disclosure Information and upon the approval and direction of the Depositor, include such disclosure information on the next Form 10-D that is required to be filed on behalf of the Trust.  If any previously filed Form 8-K, Form 10-D or Form 10-K needs to be amended, the Certificate Administrator shall notify the Depositor and such other parties as may be required and such parties shall reasonably cooperate to prepare any necessary Form 8-K/A, Form 10-D/A or Form 10-K/A.  Any form filed under Section 13.8(a), Form 12b-25 or any amendment to Form 8-K, Form 10-D or Form 10-K shall be signed, in the case of form filed under Section 13.8(a), Form 12b-25 or any amendment to Form 8-K or Form 10-D, by a duly authorized officer of the Depositor, and in the case of Form 10-K, by a senior officer of the Depositor in charge of securitization.  The parties to this Agreement acknowledge (and each Additional Servicer and each Servicing Function Participant shall be required to acknowledge) that the performance by the Certificate Administrator of its duties under this Section 13.8 related to the timely preparation and filing of any form filed under Section 13.8(a), a Form 12b-25 or any amendment to Form 8-K, Form 10-D or Form 10-K is contingent upon such parties (and, to the extent applicable, any Additional Servicer or Servicing Function Participant) performing their duties under this Section 13.8(b).  The Certificate Administrator shall have no liability for any loss, expense, damage, claim arising out of or with respect to any failure to properly prepare and/or timely file any such form filed under Section 13.8(a), Form 12b-25 or any amendments to Forms 8-K, Form 10-D or Form 10-K, where such failure results from the Certificate Administrator's inability or failure to receive, on a timely basis, any information from any other party hereto needed to prepare, arrange for execution or file such form filed under Section 13.8(a), Form 12b-25 or any amendments to Forms 8-K, 10-D or 10-K, not resulting from its own negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct.

Promptly after receipt of each such Officer's Certificate, the Depositor and, if applicable, the depositor under any Other Companion Loan Pooling and Servicing Agreement, shall have the right to review such Officer's Certificate and, if applicable, consult with each Certifying Servicer, as applicable, as to the nature of any failures by such Certifying Servicer in the fulfillment of any of the Certifying Servicer's obligations hereunder, or any failures by an Additional Servicer retained by such Certifying Servicer in the fulfillment of any of such Additional Servicer's obligations under the applicable sub-servicing or primary servicing agreement.

 If any Serviced Companion Loan is deposited into an Other Securitization, each Certifying Servicer, to the extent applicable, shall provide (within the time periods provided for under the related Other Companion Loan Pooling and Servicing Agreement to permit such requesting party to comply with its reporting obligations thereunder), if requested by a party to the Other Companion Loan Pooling and Servicing Agreement, an Officer's Certificate as set forth in this Section.  With respect to any Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan serviced under a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan Pooling and Servicing Agreement, the Master Servicer shall use reasonable best efforts to procure an Officer's Certificate as set forth in this Section, or in the form specified in the applicable Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan Pooling and Servicing Agreement, from the Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan Master Servicer, Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan Special Servicer, the Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan Certificate Administrator and the Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan Custodian in form and substance similar to the Officer's Certificate described in this Section.

 Section 14.12     Intention of Parties.  It is the express intent of the parties hereto that the conveyance of the Mortgage Loans and related rights and property to the Trustee, for the benefit of the Certificateholders, by the Depositor as provided in Section 2.1 be, and be construed as, an absolute sale of the Mortgage Loans and related property.  It is, further, not the intention of the parties that such conveyance be deemed a pledge of the Mortgage Loans and related property by the Depositor to the Trustee to secure a debt or other obligation of the Depositor.  However, if, notwithstanding the intent of the parties, the Mortgage Loans or any related property is held to be the property of the Depositor, or if for any other reason this Agreement is held or deemed to create a security interest in the Mortgage Loans or any related property, then this Agreement shall be deemed to be a security agreement; and the conveyance provided for in Section 2.1 shall be deemed to be a grant by the Depositor to the Trustee, for the benefit of the Certificateholders, of, and the Depositor hereby grants to the Trustee, for the benefit of the Certificateholders, a security interest in all of the Depositor's right, title, and interest, whether now owned or existing or hereafter acquired or arising, in, to and under:



 (i)           the property described in clauses (1)-(4) below (regardless of whether subject to the UCC or how classified thereunder) and all accounts, general intangibles, chattel paper, instruments, documents, money, deposit accounts, certificates of deposit, goods, letters of credit, advices of credit and investment property consisting of, arising from or relating to any of the property described in clauses (1)-(4) below: (1) the Mortgage Loans identified on the Mortgage Loan Schedule, including the related Mortgage Notes, Mortgages, security agreements, and title, hazard and other insurance policies, including all Qualifying Substitute Mortgage Loans, all distributions with respect thereto payable on and after the Cut-Off Date, and the Mortgage Files; (2) the Distribution Account, all REO Accounts, the Collection Account, and the Reserve Accounts, including all property therein and all income from the investment of funds therein (including any accrued discount realized on liquidation of any investment purchased at a discount); (3) the REMIC I Regular Interests and the REMIC II Regular Interests; and (4) the Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreements that are permitted to be assigned to the Trustee pursuant to Section 14 thereof;



 (ii)         all accounts, general intangibles, chattel paper, instruments, documents, money, deposit accounts, certificates of deposit, goods, letters of credit, advices of







 credit, investment property, and other rights arising from or by virtue of the disposition of, or collections with respect to, or insurance proceeds payable with respect to, or claims against other Persons with respect to, all or any part of the collateral described in clause (i) above (including any accrued discount realized on liquidation of any investment purchased at a discount); and



 (iii)        all cash and non-cash Proceeds (as defined in the Uniform Commercial Code) of the collateral described in clauses (i) and (ii) above.



 The possession by the Custodian (on the Trustee's behalf) of the Mortgage Notes, the Mortgages and such other goods, advices of credit, instruments, money, documents, chattel paper or certificated securities and the possession by the Master Servicer (on the Trustee's behalf) of the letters of credit shall be deemed to be possession by the secured party or possession by a purchaser for purposes of perfecting the security interest pursuant to the Uniform Commercial Code (including, without limitation, Sections 8-301 and 9-315 thereof) as in force in the relevant jurisdiction.



 Notifications to Persons holding such property, and acknowledgments, receipts or confirmations from Persons holding such property, shall be deemed to be notifications to, or acknowledgments, receipts or confirmations from, securities intermediaries, bailees or agents of, or persons holding for, the Trustee, as applicable, for the purpose of perfecting such security interest under applicable law.



 The Depositor and, at the Depositor's direction, the Master Servicer and the Trustee, shall, to the extent consistent with this Agreement, take such reasonable actions as may be necessary to ensure that, if this Agreement were deemed to create a security interest in the property described above, such security interest would be deemed to be a perfected security interest of first priority under applicable law and will be maintained as such throughout the term of the Agreement.  The Master Servicer shall prepare and make all filings necessary to maintain the effectiveness of any original filings necessary under the Uniform Commercial Code as in effect in any jurisdiction to perfect the Trustee's security interest in such property, including without limitation (i) continuation statements, and (ii) such other statements as may be occasioned by any transfer of any interest of the Master Servicer or the Depositor in such property.  In connection herewith, the Trustee shall have all of the rights and remedies of a secured party and creditor under the Uniform Commercial Code as in force in the relevant jurisdiction.



 Section 14.13    Recordation of Agreement.  This Agreement is subject to recordation in all appropriate public offices for real property records in all the counties or other comparable jurisdictions in which any or all of the properties subject to the Mortgages are situated, and in any other appropriate public recording office or elsewhere.  Such recordation, if any, shall be effected by the Master Servicer at the expense of the Trust as an Additional Trust Expense, but only upon direction of the Depositor accompanied by an opinion of counsel to the effect that such recordation materially and beneficially affects the interests of the Certificateholders of the Trust.



 Section 14.14     Rating Agency Surveillance Fees.  The parties hereto acknowledge that on the Closing Date the Sellers will pay the ongoing monitoring fees of the







 Rating Agencies relating to the rating of the Certificates and that no surveillance fees are payable subsequent to the Closing Date in respect of the rating of the Certificates.

EACH PARTY HERETO AGREES THAT ANY SUCH CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION SHALL BE TRIED BY A COURT TRIAL WITHOUT A JURY.  WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, THE PARTIES FURTHER AGREE THAT THEIR RESPECTIVE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IS WAIVED BY OPERATION OF THIS SECTION AS TO ANY ACTION, COUNTERCLAIM OR OTHER PROCEEDING WHICH SEEKS, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, TO CHALLENGE THE VALIDITY OR ENFORCEABILITY OF THIS AGREEMENT, ANY ASSIGNMENT OR ANY PROVISION HEREOF OR THEREOF.

 (b)           Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, no Certificateholder, solely by virtue of its status as a Certificateholder, shall have any right to vote or in any manner otherwise control the Master Servicer or operation and management of the Trust, or the obligations of the parties hereto, nor shall anything herein set forth, or contained in the terms of the Certificates, be construed so as to constitute the Certificateholders from time to time as partners or members of an association, nor shall any Certificateholder be under any liability to







 any third person by reason of any action taken by the parties to this Agreement pursuant to any provision hereof.



 (c)           No Certificateholder, solely by virtue of its status as Certificateholder, shall have any right by virtue or by availing of any provision of this Agreement to institute any suit, action or proceeding in equity or at law upon or under or with respect to this Agreement unless the Holders of Certificates evidencing not less than 50% of the Aggregate Principal Amount of the Certificates then outstanding shall have made written request upon the Trustee to institute such action, suit or proceeding in its own name as Trustee hereunder and shall have offered to the Trustee such reasonable indemnity as it may require against the cost, expenses and liabilities to be incurred therein or thereby, and the Trustee, for sixty (60) days after its receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity, shall have neglected or refused to institute any such action, suit or proceeding and no direction inconsistent with such written request has been given the Trustee during such sixty-day period by such Certificateholders; it being understood and intended, and being expressly covenanted by each Certificateholder with every other Certificateholder and the Trustee, that no one or more Holders of Certificates shall have any right in any manner whatever by virtue or by availing of any provision of this Agreement to affect, disturb or prejudice the rights of the Holders of any other of such Certificates, or to obtain or seek to obtain priority over or preference to any other such Holder, or to enforce any right under this Agreement, except in the manner herein provided and for the benefit of all Certificateholders.

 (a)           Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action provided by this Agreement to be given or taken by Holders may be embodied in and evidenced by one or more instruments of substantially similar tenor signed by such Holders in person or by agent duly appointed in writing; and, except as herein otherwise expressly provided, such action shall become effective when such instrument or instruments are delivered to the Trustee or the Custodian, as applicable, and, where it is hereby expressly required, to the Depositor and the Certificate Administrator.  Such instrument or instruments (as the action embodies therein and evidenced thereby) are herein sometimes referred to as an "Act" of the Holders signing such instrument or instruments.  Proof of execution of any such instrument or of a writing appointing any such agents shall be sufficient for any purpose of this Agreement and conclusive in favor of the Trustee, the Custodian, the Depositor and the Certificate Administrator, if made in the manner provided in this Section.  Each of the Trustee and the Custodian agrees to promptly notify the Depositor of any such instrument or instruments received by it, and to promptly forward copies of the same.



 (b)           The fact and date of the execution by any Person of any such instrument or writing may be proved by the affidavit of a witness of such execution or by the certificate of any notary public or other officer authorized by law to take acknowledgments or deeds, certifying







 that the individual signing such instrument or writing acknowledged to such notary public or other officer the execution thereof.  Whenever such execution is by an officer of a corporation or a member of a partnership on behalf of such corporation or partnership, such certificate or affidavit shall also constitute sufficient proof of such officer's or member's authority.  The fact and date of the execution of any such instrument or writing, or the authority of the individual executing the same, may also be proved in any other manner which the Trustee deems sufficient.



 (c)           The ownership of Certificates (notwithstanding any notation of ownership or other writing thereon made by anyone other than the Trustee or the Custodian) shall be proved by the Certificate Register, and none of the Trustee, the Custodian, the Depositor or the Certificate Administrator shall be affected by any notice to the contrary.



 (d)           Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action by the Holder of any Certificate shall bind every future Holder of the same Certificate and the Holder of every Certificate issued upon the registration of transfer thereof or in exchange therefor or in lieu thereof, in respect of anything done, omitted or suffered to be done by the Trustee, the Custodian, the Certificate Administrator or the Depositor in reliance thereon, whether or not notation of such action is made upon such Certificate.

 Section 14.21     Limitation on Liability of the Depositor and Others.

No service charge will be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange but the Certificate Registrar may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any transfer or exchange of Certificates.



 As and when provided in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, including but not limited to the transfer restrictions described above, a Definitive Certificate may be converted into an interest in a Global Certificate of the applicable Class, an interest in a Global Certificate may be converted into a Definitive Certificate of the applicable Class, an interest in a Rule 144A Global Certificate may be converted into an interest in a Regulation S Global Certificate of the applicable Class and an interest in a Regulation S Global Certificate may be converted into an interest in a Rule 144A Global Certificate of the applicable Class.

To the extent not defined herein, the capitalized terms used herein have the respective meanings assigned in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.



 This Certificate is one of a duly authorized issue of Certificates designated as the Morgan Stanley Bank of America Merrill Lynch Trust 2013-C12, Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2013-C12 (herein called the "Certificates").

 This Certificate does not purport to summarize the Pooling and Servicing Agreement and reference is made to that agreement for information with respect to the interests, rights, benefits, obligations, proceeds, and duties evidenced hereby and the rights, duties and obligations of the parties thereto.  This Certificate is issued under and is subject to the terms, provisions and conditions of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, to which Pooling and Servicing Agreement, as amended from time to time, the Holder of this Certificate by virtue of the acceptance hereof assents and by which such Holder is bound.

 No transfer, sale, pledge or other disposition of this Certificate or interest therein shall be made unless such transfer, sale, pledge or other disposition is exempt from the registration and/or qualification requirements of the Securities Act and any applicable state securities laws, or is otherwise made in accordance with the Securities Act and such state securities laws.  If a transfer of any Non-Registered Certificate held as a Definitive Certificate is to be made without registration under the Securities Act (other than in connection with the initial issuance of the Certificates or a transfer of such Certificate by the Depositor or one of its Affiliates), then the Certificate Registrar shall refuse to register such transfer unless it receives (and upon receipt, may conclusively rely upon) either:  (i) a certificate from the Certificateholder desiring to effect such transfer substantially in the form attached as Exhibit D-1 to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement and a certificate from such Certificateholder's prospective Transferee substantially in the form attached either as Exhibit D-2A or Exhibit D-2B to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement; or (ii) an opinion of counsel satisfactory to the Certificate Registrar to the effect that such transfer shall be made without registration under the Securities Act, together with the written certification(s) as to the facts surrounding such transfer from the Certificateholder desiring to effect such transfer and/or such Certificateholder's prospective Transferee on which such opinion of counsel is based (which opinion of counsel shall not be an expense of the Trust or of the Depositor, the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Certificate Administrator, the Custodian, the Trustee, the Trust Advisor or the Certificate Registrar in their respective capacities as such).  No Person may hold an interest in a Rule 144A Global Certificate unless that Person is a Qualified Institutional Buyer, and no "UxxPDSxxPD person" (as that term is defined in Rule 902(k) under the Securities Act) may hold an interest in a Regulation S Global Certificate, and transfers of interests in the Global Certificates that would result in a violation of the foregoing are prohibited.  No party to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement is obligated to register or qualify any Class of Non-Registered Certificates under the Securities Act or any other securities law or to take any action not otherwise required under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement to permit the transfer of any Certificate.  Any Certificateholder or Certificate Owner







 desiring to effect a transfer of this Certificate or interests therein shall, and does hereby agree to, indemnify each Underwriter, each Initial Purchaser and each party to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement against any liability that may result if the transfer is not exempt from such registration or qualification or is not made in accordance with such federal and state laws.

Each Person who acquires any Non-Investment Grade Certificate as a Definitive Certificate (unless it shall have acquired such Certificate from the Depositor or an Affiliate thereof or unless, in the case of a Non-Investment Grade Certificate, it shall have delivered to the Certificate Registrar the certification of facts and Opinion of Counsel referred to in clause (ii) of the preceding sentence) shall be required to deliver to the Certificate Registrar a certification in the form of Exhibit D-2A or Exhibit D-2B to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement that includes a certification to the effect that:  (i) it is neither a Plan nor any Person who is directly or indirectly purchasing such Certificate or interest therein on behalf of, as named fiduciary of, as trustee of, or with "plan assets" of a Plan; or (ii) the purchase and holding of such Certificate or interest therein by such Person qualifies for the exemptive relief available under Sections I and III of PTCE 95-60 or another exemption from the "prohibited transactions" rules under ERISA issued by the UxxPDSxxPD Department of Labor or similar exemption under Similar Laws.



 Subject to the terms of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, the Certificates are issuable in fully registered form only, without coupons, in minimum denominations specified in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.

 As and when provided in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, including but not limited to the transfer restrictions described above, a Definitive Certificate may be converted into an interest in a Global Certificate of the applicable Class, an interest in a Global Certificate may be converted into a Definitive Certificate of the applicable Class, an interest in a Rule 144A Global Certificate may be converted into an interest in a Regulation S Global Certificate of the applicable Class and an interest in a Regulation S Global Certificate may be converted into an interest in a Rule 144A Global Certificate of the applicable Class.

If a transfer of any Non-Registered Certificate held as a Definitive Certificate is to be made without registration under the Securities Act (other than in connection with the initial issuance of the Certificates or a transfer of such Certificate by the Depositor or one of its Affiliates), then the Certificate Registrar shall refuse to register such transfer unless it receives (and upon receipt, may conclusively rely upon) either:  (i) a certificate from the Certificateholder desiring to effect such transfer substantially in the form attached as Exhibit D-1 to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement and a certificate from such Certificateholder's prospective Transferee substantially in the form attached either as Exhibit D-2A or Exhibit D-2B to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement; or (ii) an opinion of counsel satisfactory to the Certificate Registrar to the effect that such transfer shall be made without registration under the Securities Act, together with the written certification(s) as to the facts surrounding such transfer from the Certificateholder desiring to effect such transfer and/or such Certificateholder's prospective Transferee on which such opinion of counsel is based (which opinion of counsel shall not be an expense of the Trust or of the Depositor, the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Certificate Administrator, the Custodian, the Trustee, the Trust Advisor or the Certificate Registrar in their respective capacities as such).  No Person may hold an interest in a Rule 144A Global Certificate unless that Person is a Qualified Institutional Buyer, and no "UxxPDSxxPD person" (as that term is defined in Rule 902(k) under the Securities Act) may hold an interest in a Regulation S Global Certificate, and transfers of interests in the Global Certificates that would result in a violation of the foregoing are prohibited.  No party to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement is obligated to register or qualify any Class of Non-Registered Certificates under the Securities Act or any other securities law or to take any action not otherwise required under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement to permit the transfer of any Certificate.  Any Certificateholder or Certificate Owner

Each Person who acquires any Non-Investment Grade Certificate as a Definitive Certificate (unless it shall have acquired such Certificate from the Depositor or an Affiliate thereof or unless, in the case of a Non-Investment Grade Certificate, it shall have delivered to the Certificate Registrar the certification of facts and Opinion of Counsel referred to in clause (ii) of the preceding sentence) shall be required to deliver to the Certificate Registrar a certification in the form of Exhibit D-2A or Exhibit D-2B to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement that includes a certification to the effect that:  (i) it is neither a Plan nor any Person who is directly or indirectly purchasing such Certificate or interest therein on behalf of, as named fiduciary of, as trustee of, or with "plan assets" of a Plan; or (ii) the purchase and holding of such Certificate or interest therein by such Person qualifies for the exemptive relief available under Sections I and III of PTCE 95-60 or another exemption from the "prohibited transactions" rules under ERISA issued by the UxxPDSxxPD Department of Labor or similar exemption under Similar Laws.

To the extent not defined herein, the capitalized terms used herein have the respective meanings assigned in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.



 This Certificate is one of a duly authorized issue of Certificates designated as the Morgan Stanley Bank of America Merrill Lynch Trust 2013-C12, Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2013-C12 (herein called the "Certificates").  The Certificates are issued in the Classes specified in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement and will evidence in the aggregate 100% of the beneficial ownership of the Trust.  This Certificate represents an interest in the Class H Certificates equal to the quotient expressed as a percentage obtained by dividing the initial Certificate Balance of this Certificate specified on the face hereof by the initial Aggregate Certificate Balance of the Class H Certificates.



 This Certificate does not purport to summarize the Pooling and Servicing Agreement and reference is made to that agreement for information with respect to the interests, rights, benefits, obligations, proceeds, and duties evidenced hereby and the rights, duties and obligations of the parties thereto.  This Certificate is issued under and is subject to the terms, provisions and conditions of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, to which Pooling and Servicing Agreement, as amended from time to time, the Holder of this Certificate by virtue of the acceptance hereof assents and by which such Holder is bound.

Principal and interest allocated to this Certificate on any Distribution Date will be in an amount due to this Certificate's pro rata share of the amount to be distributed on the Class H Certificates as of such Distribution Date, with a final







 distribution to be made upon retirement of this Certificate as set forth in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.

Notwithstanding the above, the final distribution on any Certificate will be made only upon presentation and surrender of such Certificate at the location that will be specified in a notice of the pendency of such final distribution.

 No transfer, sale, pledge or other disposition of this Certificate or interest therein shall be made unless such transfer, sale, pledge or other disposition is exempt from the registration and/or qualification requirements of the Securities Act and any applicable state securities laws, or is otherwise made in accordance with the Securities Act and such state securities laws.  If a transfer of any Non-Registered Certificate held as a Definitive Certificate is to be made without registration under the Securities Act (other than in connection with the initial issuance of the Certificates or a transfer of such Certificate by the Depositor or one of its Affiliates), then the Certificate Registrar shall refuse to register such transfer unless it receives (and upon receipt, may conclusively rely upon) either:  (i) a certificate from the Certificateholder desiring to effect such transfer substantially in the form attached as Exhibit D-1 to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement and a certificate from such Certificateholder's prospective Transferee substantially in the form attached either as Exhibit D-2A or Exhibit D-2B to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement; or (ii) an opinion of counsel satisfactory to the Certificate Registrar to the effect that such transfer shall be made without registration under the Securities Act, together with the written certification(s) as to the facts surrounding such transfer from the Certificateholder desiring to effect such transfer and/or such Certificateholder's prospective Transferee on which such opinion of counsel is based (which opinion of counsel shall not be an expense of the Trust or of the Depositor, the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Certificate Administrator, the Custodian, the Trustee, the Trust Advisor or the Certificate Registrar in their respective capacities as such).  No Person may hold an interest in a Rule 144A Global Certificate unless that Person is a Qualified Institutional Buyer, and no "UxxPDSxxPD person" (as that term is defined in Rule 902(k) under the Securities Act) may hold an interest in a Regulation S Global Certificate, and transfers of interests in the Global Certificates that would result in a violation of the foregoing are prohibited.  No party to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement is obligated to register or qualify any Class of Non-Registered Certificates under the Securities Act or any other securities law or to take any action not otherwise required under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement to permit the transfer of any Certificate.  Any Certificateholder or Certificate Owner







 desiring to effect a transfer of this Certificate or interests therein shall, and does hereby agree to, indemnify each Underwriter, each Initial Purchaser and each party to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement against any liability that may result if the transfer is not exempt from such registration or qualification or is not made in accordance with such federal and state laws.

Each Person who acquires any Non-Investment Grade Certificate as a Definitive Certificate (unless it shall have acquired such Certificate from the Depositor or an Affiliate thereof or unless, in the case of a Non-Investment Grade Certificate, it shall have delivered to the Certificate Registrar the certification of facts and Opinion of Counsel referred to in clause (ii) of the preceding sentence) shall be required to deliver to the Certificate Registrar a certification in the form of Exhibit D-2A or Exhibit D-2B to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement that includes a certification to the effect that:  (i) it is neither a Plan nor any Person who is directly or indirectly purchasing such Certificate or interest therein on behalf of, as named fiduciary of, as trustee of, or with "plan assets" of a Plan; or (ii) the purchase and holding of such Certificate or interest therein by such Person qualifies for the exemptive relief available under Sections I and III of PTCE 95-60 or another exemption from the "prohibited transactions" rules under ERISA issued by the UxxPDSxxPD Department of Labor or similar exemption under Similar Laws.



 Subject to the terms of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, the Certificates are issuable in fully registered form only, without coupons, in minimum denominations specified in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.

No service charge will be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange but the Certificate Registrar may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any transfer or exchange of Certificates.







 As and when provided in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, including but not limited to the transfer restrictions described above, a Definitive Certificate may be converted into an interest in a Global Certificate of the applicable Class, an interest in a Global Certificate may be converted into a Definitive Certificate of the applicable Class, an interest in a Rule 144A Global Certificate may be converted into an interest in a Regulation S Global Certificate of the applicable Class and an interest in a Regulation S Global Certificate may be converted into an interest in a Rule 144A Global Certificate of the applicable Class.

This Certificate is issued under and is subject to the terms, provisions and conditions of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, to which Pooling and Servicing Agreement, as amended from time to time, the Holder of this Certificate by virtue of the acceptance hereof assents and by which such Holder is bound.  In the case of any conflict between terms specified in this Certificate and terms specified in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, the terms of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement shall govern.



 The Holder of this Certificate shall be entitled to receive only certain amounts set forth in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, including a distribution upon termination of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement and the respective REMICs created thereby of the amounts which remain on deposit in the Distribution Account after payment to the holders of all other Certificates of all amounts set forth in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.

The Determination Date is the 11th day of each month, or, if the 11th day is not a Business Day, the next succeeding Business Day (a "Determination Date"), commencing on November 12, 2013.

 Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by the Authenticating Agent, by manual signature, this Certificate shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement or be valid for any purpose.



 The Certificates are limited in right of payment to certain collections and recoveries respecting the Mortgage Loans, all as more specifically set forth in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.  As provided in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, withdrawals from the Collection Account shall be made from time to time for purposes other than distributions to Certificateholders, such purposes including reimbursement of certain expenses incurred with respect to the servicing of the Mortgage Loans and administration of the Trust.



 All distributions under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement will be made by or on behalf of the Certificate Administrator by check mailed to such Holder's address as it appears on the Certificate Register of the Certificate Registrar or, upon written request to the Certificate Administrator on or prior to the related Record Date (or upon standing instructions given to the Certificate Administrator on the Closing Date prior to any Record Date, which instructions may be revoked at any time thereafter upon written notice to the Certificate Administrator five







 (5) days prior to the related Record Date) made by a Certificateholder by wire transfer in immediately available funds to an account specified in the request of such Certificateholder.  Notwithstanding the above, the final distribution on any Certificate will be made only upon presentation and surrender of such Certificate at the location that will be specified in a notice of the pendency of such final distribution.



 The Pooling and Servicing Agreement permits, with certain exceptions therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Certificateholders under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement at any time by the parties thereto with the consent of the Holders of not less than 51% of the aggregate Voting Rights of the Certificates then outstanding, as specified in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.  Any such consent by the Holder of this Certificate shall be conclusive and binding on such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Certificate and of any Certificate issued upon the transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof whether or not notation of such consent is made upon the Certificate.  The Pooling and Servicing Agreement also permits the amendment thereof, in certain circumstances, without the consent of the Holders of any of the Certificates.



 As provided in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of this Certificate is registrable in the Certificate Register upon surrender of this Certificate for registration of transfer at the Corporate Trust Office of the Certificate Registrar, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by an assignment in the form below or other written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Certificate Registrar duly executed by the Holder hereof or such Holder's attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Certificates of the same Class in authorized denominations will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.



 The Class R Certificates will be issued in fully registered, certificated form in minimum percentage interests of 10% and in multiples of 1% in excess thereof.



 No transfer, sale, pledge or other disposition of this Certificate or interest therein shall be made unless such transfer, sale, pledge or other disposition is exempt from the registration and/or qualification requirements of the Securities Act and any applicable state securities laws, or is otherwise made in accordance with the Securities Act and such state securities laws.  If a transfer of any Non-Registered Certificate held as a Definitive Certificate is to be made without registration under the Securities Act (other than in connection with the initial issuance of the Certificates or a transfer of such Certificate by the Depositor or one of its Affiliates), then the Certificate Registrar shall refuse to register such transfer unless it receives (and upon receipt, may conclusively rely upon) either:  (i) a certificate from the Certificateholder desiring to effect such transfer substantially in the form attached as Exhibit D-1 to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement and a certificate from such Certificateholder's prospective Transferee substantially in the form attached as Exhibit D-2A to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement; or (ii) an opinion of counsel satisfactory to the Certificate Registrar to the effect that such transfer shall be made without registration under the Securities Act, together with the written certification(s) as to the facts surrounding such transfer from the Certificateholder desiring to effect such transfer and/or such Certificateholder's prospective Transferee on which such opinion of counsel is based (which opinion of counsel shall not be an expense of the Trust or of the Depositor, the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Certificate Administrator, the







 Custodian, the Trustee, the Trust Advisor or the Certificate Registrar in their respective capacities as such).  No transfer of a Class R Certificate may be made in book-entry form or otherwise to a Person that is not a Qualified Institutional Buyer, and any certificate and/or opinion of counsel delivered pursuant to the preceding sentence must reflect that the Transferee of a Class R Certificate is a Qualified Institutional Buyer.  No Person may hold an interest in a Rule 144A Global Certificate unless that Person is a Qualified Institutional Buyer, and no "UxxPDSxxPD person" (as that term is defined in Rule 902(k) under the Securities Act) may hold an interest in a Regulation S Global Certificate, and transfers of interests in the Global Certificates that would result in a violation of the foregoing are prohibited.  No party to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement is obligated to register or qualify any Class of Non-Registered Certificates under the Securities Act or any other securities law or to take any action not otherwise required under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement to permit the transfer of any Certificate.  Any Certificateholder or Certificate Owner desiring to effect a transfer of this Certificate or interests therein shall, and does hereby agree to, indemnify each Underwriter, each Initial Purchaser and each party to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement against any liability that may result if the transfer is not exempt from such registration or qualification or is not made in accordance with such federal and state laws.



 No transfer of a Class R Certificate or any interest therein shall be made (A) to any employee benefit plan or other retirement arrangement, including individual retirement accounts and annuities, Keogh plans and collective investment funds and separate accounts in which such plans, accounts or arrangements are invested, including, without limitation, insurance company general accounts, that is subject to Title I of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or any applicable federal, state or local law ("Similar Laws") materially similar to the foregoing provisions of ERISA or the Code (each, a "Plan"), or (B) to any Person who is directly or indirectly purchasing such Certificate or interest therein on behalf of, as named fiduciary of, as trustee of, or with "plan assets" of a Plan.  Each Person who acquires any Class R Certificate (unless it shall have acquired such Certificate from the Depositor or an Affiliate thereof) shall be required to deliver to the Certificate Registrar a certification in the form of Exhibit D-2A to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement that includes a certification to the effect that it is neither a Plan nor any Person who is directly or indirectly purchasing such Certificate or interest therein on behalf of, as named fiduciary of, as trustee of, or with "plan assets" of a Plan.



 Each Person who has or who acquires any Ownership Interest in a Class R Certificate shall be deemed by the acceptance or acquisition of such Ownership Interest to have agreed to be bound by the following provisions and to have irrevocably authorized the Certificate Administrator under clause (F) of Section 3.3(e) of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement to deliver payments to a Person other than such Person and to have irrevocably authorized the Certificate Registrar under clause (G) of Section 3.3(e) of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement to negotiate the terms of any mandatory sale and to execute all instruments of Transfer and to do all other things necessary in connection with any such sale.  The rights of such person acquiring any Ownership Interest in a Class R Certificate are expressly subject to the following provisions:



 (A)           (1) Each Person holding or acquiring any Ownership Interest in a Class R Certificate shall be a Permitted Transferee and a United States Tax Person other than a partnership (including any entity treated as a partnership for UxxPDSxxPD federal income







 tax purposes) any interest in which is owned (or, may be owned pursuant to the applicable partnership agreement) directly or indirectly (other than through a UxxPDSxxPD corporation) by any person that is not a United States Tax Person, and shall promptly notify the Certificate Registrar of any change or impending change in its status as a Permitted Transferee and (2) each Person holding or acquiring any Ownership Interest in a Class R Certificate shall be a Qualified Institutional Buyer and shall promptly notify the Certificate Registrar of any change or impending change in its status as a Qualified Institutional Buyer.



 (B)           In connection with any proposed Transfer of any Ownership Interest in a Class R Certificate, the Certificate Registrar shall require delivery to it, and no Transfer of any Class R Certificate shall be registered until the Certificate Registrar receives, an affidavit and agreement substantially in the form attached to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement as Exhibit E-1 (a "Transfer Affidavit and Agreement") from the proposed Transferee, in form and substance satisfactory to the Certificate Registrar.



 (C)           Notwithstanding the delivery of a Transfer Affidavit and Agreement by a proposed Transferee under clause (B) above, if a Responsible Officer of the Certificate Registrar has actual knowledge that the proposed Transferee is not a Permitted Transferee or is not a United States Tax Person, no Transfer of an Ownership Interest in a Class R Certificate to such proposed Transferee shall be effected.



 (D)           Each Person holding or acquiring an Ownership Interest in a Class R Certificate shall agree (1) to require a Transfer Affidavit and Agreement from any prospective Transferee to whom such Person attempts to transfer its Ownership Interest in such Class R Certificate and (2) not to transfer its Ownership Interest in such Class R Certificate unless it provides to the Certificate Registrar a certificate substantially in the form attached to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement as Exhibit E-2.



 (E)           Each Person holding or acquiring an Ownership Interest in a Class R Certificate that is a "pass-through interest holder" within the meaning of temporary Treasury Regulations Section 1.67-3T(a)(2)(i)(A) or is holding an Ownership Interest in a Class R Certificate on behalf of a "pass-through interest holder", by purchasing an Ownership Interest in such Certificate, agrees to give the Certificate Registrar written notice of its status as such immediately upon holding or acquiring such Ownership Interest in a Class R Certificate.



 (F)           If any purported Transferee shall become a Holder of a Class R Certificate in violation of the provisions of Section 3.3(e) of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement or if any Holder of a Class R Certificate shall lose its status as a Permitted Transferee or a United States Tax Person, then the last preceding Holder of such Class R Certificate that was in compliance with the provisions of Section 3.3(e) of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement shall be restored, to the extent permitted by law, to all rights and obligations as Holder thereof retroactive to the date of registration of such Transfer of such Class R Certificate.  None of the Trustee, the Custodian, the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Trust Advisor, the Certificate Registrar or the Certificate Administrator shall be under any liability to any Person for any registration of Transfer of







 a Class R Certificate that is in fact not permitted by Section 3.3(e) of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement or for making any payments due on such Certificate to the Holder thereof or for taking any other action with respect to such Holder under the provisions of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.



 (G)           If any purported Transferee shall become a Holder of a Class R Certificate in violation of the restrictions in Section 3.3(e) of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, or if any Holder of a Class R Certificate shall lose its status as a Permitted Transferee or a United States Tax Person, and to the extent that the retroactive restoration of the rights and obligations of the prior Holder of such Class R Certificate as set forth in clause (F) above shall be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, then the Certificate Registrar shall have the right, without notice to the Holder or any prior Holder of such Class R Certificate, but not the obligation, to sell or cause to be sold such Class R Certificate to a purchaser selected by the Certificate Registrar on such terms as the Certificate Registrar may choose.  Such noncomplying Holder shall promptly endorse and deliver such Class R Certificate in accordance with the instructions of the Certificate Registrar.  Such purchaser may be the Certificate Registrar itself or any Affiliate of the Certificate Registrar.  The proceeds of such sale, net of the commissions (which may include commissions payable to the Certificate Registrar or its Affiliates), expenses and taxes due, if any, will be remitted by the Certificate Registrar to such noncomplying Holder.  The terms and conditions of any sale under this clause (G) shall be determined in the sole discretion of the Certificate Registrar, and the Certificate Registrar shall not be liable to any Person having an Ownership Interest in a Class R Certificate as a result of its exercise of such discretion.



 "Permitted Transferee" means any Transferee other than:  (a) a Disqualified Organization; (b) any other Person identified in an Opinion of Counsel delivered to the Certificate Administrator and the Trustee to the effect that the transfer of an ownership interest in any Class R Certificate to such Person may cause any REMIC Pool to fail to qualify as a REMIC at any time that the Certificates are outstanding, (c) a Person that is a non-United States Tax Person, (d) any partnership if any of its interests are (or under the partnership agreement are permitted to be) owned, directly or indirectly (other than through a UxxPDSxxPD corporation), by a non-United States Tax Person or (e) a United States Tax Person with respect to whom income from the Class R Certificate is attributable to a foreign permanent establishment or fixed base, within the meaning of an applicable income tax treaty, of the transferee or any other United States Tax Person.



 "United States Tax Person" means a citizen or resident of the United States, a corporation, partnership (except to the extent provided in applicable Treasury regulations) or other entity created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state of the United States or the District of Columbia, an estate whose income is subject to United States federal income tax regardless of the source of its income, or a trust if a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of such trust, and one or more such United States Tax Persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of such trust (or, to the extent provided in applicable Treasury regulations, certain trusts in existence on August 20, 1996 that have elected to be treated as United States Tax Persons).  A person not described in the immediately preceding sentence shall nevertheless be treated as a United States Tax Person if







 (i) in the hands of such person the income from a Class R Certificate is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States and such person has furnished the transferor and the Certificate Registrar with an effective IRS Form W-8ECI or other prescribed form or (ii) if in connection with the proposed transfer of a Class R Certificate, the transferor provides an opinion of counsel to the Certificate Registrar to the effect that such transfer will not be disregarded for federal income tax purposes under Treasury Regulations Section 1.860G-3.



 "Disqualified Organization" means any of (i) the United States, any State or any political subdivision thereof, or any agency or instrumentality of any of the foregoing (other than an instrumentality which is a corporation if all of its activities are subject to tax and, except for the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, a majority of its board of directors is not selected by any such governmental unit), (ii) a foreign government, international organization or any agency or instrumentality of either of the foregoing, (iii) an organization that is exempt from tax imposed by Chapter 1 of the Code (including the tax imposed by Code Section 511 on unrelated business taxable income) on any excess inclusions (as defined in Code Section 860E(c)(1)) with respect to the Class R Certificates (except certain farmers' cooperatives described in Code Section 521), (iv) rural electric and telephone cooperatives described in Section 1381(a)(2) of the Code, and (v) any other Person so designated by the Certificate Administrator based upon an Opinion of Counsel that the holding of an ownership interest in a Class R Certificate by such Person may cause (A) any of REMIC I, REMIC II or REMIC III to fail to qualify as a REMIC at any time that the Certificates are outstanding, or (B) any of REMIC I, REMIC II or REMIC III, or any Person having an Ownership Interest in any Class of Certificates, other than such Person, to incur a liability for any federal tax imposed under the Code that would not otherwise be imposed but for the transfer of an ownership interest in a Class R Certificate to such Person.  The terms "United States," "State" and "international organization" shall have the meanings set forth in Section 7701 of the Code or successor provisions.



 The provisions of Section 3.3(e) of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement may be modified, added to or eliminated, provided that there shall have been delivered to the Trustee, the Custodian, the Certificate Administrator, the Certificate Registrar, the Master Servicer, the Depositor, an Opinion of Counsel (subject to Section 5.7 of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, a copy of which shall be provided to each Rating Agency), in form and substance satisfactory to the Trustee, the Certificate Registrar and the Depositor, to the effect that such modification of, addition to or elimination of such provisions will not cause any REMIC Pool to (A) cease to qualify as a REMIC or (B) be subject to an entity-level tax caused by the Transfer of any Class R Certificate to a Person which is not a Permitted Transferee, or cause a Person other than the prospective Transferee to be subject to a tax caused by the Transfer of a Class R Certificate to a Person which is not a Permitted Transferee.



 As provided in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Certificates are exchangeable for new Certificates of the same Class in authorized denominations as requested by the Holder surrendering the same.  No service charge will be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange but the Certificate Registrar may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any transfer or exchange of Certificates.







 The Depositor, the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Trust Advisor, the Trustee, the Custodian, the Certificate Administrator, the Certificate Registrar, the Authenticating Agent and any of their agents may treat the Person in whose name this Certificate is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, and none of the Depositor, the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Trust Advisor, the Trustee, the Custodian, the Certificate Administrator, the Certificate Registrar, the Authenticating Agent or any such agents shall be affected by notice to the contrary.



 The obligations and responsibilities of the Trustee and the Certificate Administrator created hereby (other than the obligation of the Certificate Administrator, to make payments to the Class R Certificateholders, as set forth in Section 11.3 of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement and other than the obligations in the nature of information or tax reporting) shall terminate on the earliest of (i) the later of (A) the final payment or other liquidation of the last Mortgage Loan remaining in the Trust (and final distribution to the Certificateholders) and (B) the disposition of all REO Property (and final distribution to the Certificateholders), (ii) the sale of the property held by the Trust in accordance with Section 11.1(b) of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement or (iii) voluntary exchange by the Sole Certificateholder of all the outstanding Certificates (other than the Class R Certificates) for the remaining Mortgage Loans and REO Properties in the Trust Fund pursuant to the terms of Section 11.1(d) of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement; provided that in no event shall the Trust continue beyond the expiration of 21 years from the death of the last survivor of the descendants of Joseph P. Kennedy, the late Ambassador of the United States to the Court of St. James, living on the date hereof.  The parties designated in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement may exercise their option to purchase the Mortgage Loans and any other property remaining in the Trust and cause the termination of the Trust in accordance with the requirements set forth in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.  Upon termination of the Trust and payment of the Certificates and of all administrative expenses associated with the Trust, any remaining assets of the Trust shall be distributed to the holders of the Class R Certificates.



 The Certificate Registrar has executed this Certificate under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.



 THIS CERTIFICATE AND THE POOLING AND SERVICING AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE INTERNAL LAWS AND DECISIONS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, AND THE PROVISIONS OF SECTION 5-1401 OF THE NEW YORK GENERAL OBLIGATIONS LAW SHALL APPLY TO THIS CERTIFICATE AND THE POOLING AND SERVICING AGREEMENT.

 ___       The Transferee is not a "UxxPDSxxPD Person" and under applicable law in effect on the date hereof, no taxes will be required to be withheld by the Certificate Administrator (or its agent) with respect to distributions to be made on the Transferred Certificates.  The Transferee has attached hereto either (i) a duly executed IRS Form W-8BEN (or successor form), which identifies the Transferee as the beneficial owner of the Transferred Certificates and states that the Transferee is not a UxxPDSxxPD Person, (ii) Form W-8IMY (with appropriate attachments) or (iii) two duly executed copies of IRS Form W-8ECI (or successor form), which identify the Transferee as the beneficial owner of the Transferred Certificates and states that interest and original issue discount on the Transferred Certificates is, or is expected to be, effectively connected with a UxxPDSxxPD trade or business.

 For this purpose, "UxxPDSxxPD Person" means a citizen or resident of the United States for UxxPDSxxPD federal income tax purposes, a corporation or partnership (except to the extent provided in applicable Treasury Regulations) created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any State thereof or the District of Columbia, including any entity treated as a corporation or partnership for federal income tax purposes, an estate the income of which is subject to UxxPDSxxPD federal income taxation regardless of its source, or a trust if a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of such trust, and one or more United States fiduciaries have the authority to control all substantial decisions of such trust (or, to the extent provided in applicable Treasury Regulations, certain trusts in existence on October 20, 1996 which are eligible to elect to be treated as UxxPDSxxPD Persons).



 The Depositor, the Trustee and the Certificate Administrator are entitled to rely upon this letter and are irrevocably authorized to produce this letter or a copy hereof to any interested party in any administrative or legal proceedings or official inquiry with respect to the matters covered hereby.



 4.

 ___       The Transferee (A) is not a Plan (as defined in paragraph 4 above), and (B) is not directly or indirectly purchasing the Transferred Certificates or any interest therein on behalf of, as named fiduciary of, as trustee of, or with "plan assets" of a Plan.



 ___       The Transferee has provided the Certificate Registrar with a certification of facts and an Opinion of Counsel (copies of which are attached hereto) to the effect that the transfer of the Transferred Certificates from the Transferor to the Transferee will not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or subject the Depositor, the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator, the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Trust Advisor or the Certificate Registrar to any obligation in addition to those undertaken in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.



 ___       The purchase and holding of such Certificate or interest therein by such person qualifies for the exemptive relief available under Sections I and III of Prohibited Transaction Class Exemption 95-60 or another exemption from the "prohibited transactions" rules under ERISA issued by the UxxPDSxxPD Department of Labor or similar exemption under Similar Laws.

For purposes of determining the aggregate amount of securities owned and/or invested on a discretionary basis by the Transferee, the Transferee used the cost of such securities to the Transferee, unless the Transferee reports its securities holdings in its financial statements on the basis of their market value, and no current information with respect to the cost of those securities has been published, in which case the securities were valued at market.  Further, in determining such aggregate amount, the Transferee may have included securities owned by subsidiaries of the Transferee, but only if such subsidiaries are consolidated with the Transferee in its financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and if the investments of such subsidiaries are managed under the Transferee's direction.

 6.           If the answer to the foregoing question is "no", then in each case where the Transferee is purchasing for an account other than its own, such account belongs to a third party that is itself a "qualified institutional buyer" within the meaning of Rule 144A, and the "qualified institutional buyer" status of such third party has been established by the Transferee through one or more of the appropriate methods contemplated by Rule 144A.

For purposes of determining the amount of securities owned by the Transferee or the Transferee's Family of Investment Companies, the cost of such securities was used, unless the Transferee or any member of the Transferee's Family of Investment Companies, as the case may be, reports its securities holdings in its financial statements on the basis of their market value, and no current information with respect to the cost of those securities has been published, in which case the securities of such entity were valued at market.

The term "Family of Investment Companies" as used herein means two or more registered investment companies (or series thereof) that have the same investment adviser or investment advisers that are affiliated (by virtue of being majority owned subsidiaries of the same parent or because one investment adviser is a majority owned subsidiary of the other).

If the answer to the foregoing question is "no", then in each case where the Transferee is purchasing for an account other than its own, such account belongs to a third party that is itself a "qualified institutional buyer" within the meaning of Rule 144A, and the "qualified institutional buyer" status of such third party has been established by the Transferee through one or more of the appropriate methods contemplated by Rule 144A.

 3.           The Transferee (i) is, and as of the date of transfer will be, a "Qualified Institutional Buyer" and will endeavor to remain a "Qualified Institutional Buyer" for so long as it holds the Residual Certificates, and (ii) is acquiring the Residual Certificates for its own account or for the account of another prospective transferee from which it has received an affidavit in substantially the same form as this affidavit. A "Qualified Institutional Buyer" is a qualified institutional buyer qualifying pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.



 4.           The Transferee is aware (i) of the tax that would be imposed on transfers of the Residual Certificates to "disqualified organizations" under the Code that applies to all transfers of the Residual Certificates; (ii) that such tax would be on the transferor or, if such







 transfer is through an agent (which Person includes a broker, nominee or middleman) for a non-Permitted Transferee, on the agent; (iii) that the Person otherwise liable for the tax shall be relieved of liability for the tax if the transferee furnishes to such Person an affidavit that the transferee is a Permitted Transferee and, at the time of transfer, such Person does not have actual knowledge that the affidavit is false; and (iv) that the Residual Certificates may be a "noneconomic residual interest" within the meaning of Treasury regulation Section 1.860E-1(c) and that the transferor of a "noneconomic residual interest" will remain liable for any taxes due with respect to the income on such residual interest, unless no significant purpose of the transfer is to enable the transferor to impede the assessment or collection of tax.



 5.           The Transferee is aware of the tax imposed on a "pass-through entity" holding the Residual Certificates if at any time during the taxable year of the pass-through entity a non-Permitted Transferee is the record holder of an interest in such entity. (For this purpose, a "pass-through entity" includes a regulated investment company, a real estate investment trust or common trust fund, a partnership, trust or estate, and certain cooperatives.)



 6.           The Transferee is aware that the Certificate Registrar will not register any transfer of the Residual Certificates by the Transferee unless the Transferee's transferee, or such transferee's agent, delivers to the Certificate Registrar, among other things, an affidavit and agreement in substantially the same form as this affidavit and agreement. The Transferee expressly agrees that it will not consummate any such transfer if it knows or believes that any representation contained in such affidavit and agreement is false.



 7.           The Transferee consents to any additional restrictions or arrangements that shall be deemed necessary upon advice of counsel to constitute a reasonable arrangement to ensure that the Residual Certificate will only be owned, directly or indirectly, by a Permitted Transferee.



 8.           The Transferee's taxpayer identification number is _________________.



 9.           The Transferee has reviewed the provisions of Section 3.3(e) of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, a description of which provisions is set forth in the Residual Certificates (in particular, clause (F) of the first paragraph of Section 3.3(e) which authorizes the Certificate Administrator or the Trustee to deliver payments on the Residual Certificate to a Person other than the Transferee and clause (G) of the first paragraph of Section 3.3(e) which authorizes the Certificate Registrar to negotiate a mandatory sale of the Residual Certificates, in either case, in the event that the Transferee holds such Residual Certificates in violation of Section 3.3(e)); and the Transferee expressly agrees to be bound by and to comply with such provisions.



 10.           No purpose of the Transferee relating to its purchase or any sale of the Residual Certificates is or will be to impede the assessment or collection of any tax.



 11.           The Transferee hereby represents to and for the benefit of the transferor that the Transferee intends to pay any taxes associated with holding the Residual Certificates as they become due, fully understanding that it may incur tax liabilities in excess of any cash flows generated by the Residual Certificates.







 12.           The Transferee will not cause income with respect to the Residual Certificates to be attributable to a foreign permanent establishment or fixed base, within the meaning of any applicable income tax treaty, of such proposed Transferee or any other United States Tax Person.



 13.           The Transferee will, in connection with any transfer that it makes of the Residual Certificates, deliver to the Certificate Registrar a representation letter substantially in the form of Exhibit E-2 to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement in which it will represent and warrant, among other things, that it is not transferring the Residual Certificates to impede the assessment or collection of any tax and that it has at the time of such transfer conducted a reasonable investigation of the financial condition of the proposed transferee as contemplated by Treasury regulation Section 1.860E-1(c)(4)(i) and has satisfied the requirements of such provision.



 14.           The Transferee is a citizen or resident of the United States, a corporation, a partnership or other entity created or organized in, or under the laws of, the United States or any political subdivision thereof, or an estate or trust whose income from sources without the United States is includible in gross income for United States federal income tax purposes regardless of its connection with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States.



 15.           [Select a or b, as applicable] [a]  The Transferee has computed any consideration paid to it to acquire the Class R Certificate in accordance with UxxPDSxxPD Treasury Regulations Sections 1.860E-1(c)(7) and 1.860E-1(c)(8) by computing present values using a discount rate equal to the Federal short-term rate prescribed by Section 1274(d) of the Code for the month of the transfer and the compounding period used by the Transferee.



 [b]  The transfer of the Class R Certificate complies with Treasury Regulation Sections 1.860E-1(c)(5) and 1.860E-1(c)(6) and, accordingly,



 (i)           the Transferee is an "eligible corporation," as defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.860E-1(c)(6), as to which income from the Class R Certificate will only be taxed in the United States;



 (ii)           at the time of the transfer, and at the close of the Transferee's two fiscal years preceding the Transferee's fiscal year of the transfer, the Transferee had gross assets for financial reporting purposes (excluding any obligation of a person related to the Transferee within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.860E-1(c)(6)(ii) and excluding any other asset if a principal purpose for holding or acquiring that asset is to permit the Transferee to satisfy this Section 15(ii)) in excess of $100 million and net assets in excess of $10 million;



 (iii)           the Transferee will transfer the Class R Certificate only to another "eligible corporation," as defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.860E-1(c)(6), in a transaction that satisfies the requirements of Treasury Regulation Section 1.860E-1(c)(5)(i), (ii) and (iii) and this Section 15 and the transfer is not to a foreign permanent establishment (within the meaning of an applicable income tax treaty) of such eligible corporation or any other arrangement by which the Class R Certificate will be at any time subject to net tax by a foreign country or possession of the United States; and







 (iv)           the Transferee determined the consideration paid to it to acquire the Class R Certificate, based on reasonable market assumptions (including, but not limited to, borrowing and investment rates, prepayment and loss assumptions, expense and reinvestment assumptions, tax rates and other factors specific to the Transferee) that it has determined in good faith, is a reasonable amount.



 16.           The Transferee (i) is, and at the time of transfer will be, a United States Tax Person other than a partnership (including any entity treated as a partnership for UxxPDSxxPD federal income tax purposes) any interest in which is owned (or, may be owned pursuant to the applicable partnership agreement) directly or indirectly (other than through a UxxPDSxxPD corporation) by any person that is not a United States Tax Person, and (ii) is not, and at the time of the transfer will not be, a foreign permanent establishment or fixed base, within the meaning of any applicable income tax treaty, of any United States Tax Person.  If the Transferee is a partnership, trust or disregarded entity for UxxPDSxxPD federal income tax purposes, then each person that may be allocated income from the Class R Certificate is, and at the time of transfer will be, a United States Tax Person.



 17.           The Transferee has historically paid its debts as they have come due and will continue to do so in the future.







 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Transferee has caused this instrument to be executed on its behalf, pursuant to the authority of its Board of Directors, by its ____________________ and its corporate seal to be hereunto attached this ___ day of ___________, ____.

 Ladies and Gentlemen:



 This letter is delivered to you in connection with the transfer by _________________ (the "Transferor") to _________________ (the "Transferee") of Class R Certificates evidencing a ____% Percentage Interest in such Class (the "Residual Certificates").  The Certificates, including the Residual Certificates, were issued pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, dated as of October 1, 2013 (the "Pooling and Servicing Agreement"), and executed in connection with the above-referenced transaction.  All capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined herein shall have the respective meanings set forth in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement. The Transferor hereby certifies, represents and warrants to you, as Certificate Registrar, that:



 1.           No purpose of the Transferor relating to the transfer of the Residual Certificates by the Transferor to the Transferee is or will be to impede the assessment or collection of any tax.



 2.           The Transferor understands that the Transferee has delivered to you a Transfer Affidavit and Agreement in the form attached to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement. The Transferor has no knowledge or reason to know that any representation contained therein is false.



 3.           The Transferor has at the time of this transfer conducted a reasonable investigation of the financial condition of the Transferee as contemplated by Treasury regulation Section 1.860E-1(c)(4)(i) and, as a result of that investigation, the Transferor has determined that the Transferee has historically paid its debts as they became due and has found no significant evidence to indicate that the Transferee will not continue to pay its debts as they become due in the future. The Transferor understands that the transfer of the Residual Certificates may not be respected for United States income tax purposes (and the Transferor may continue to be liable for United States income taxes associated therewith) unless the Transferor has conducted such an investigation.







 4.           The Transferor does not know and has no reason to know that the Transferee is not a Permitted Transferee, is not a United States Tax Person or a partnership (including any entity treated as a partnership for UxxPDSxxPD federal income tax purposes) any interest in which is owned (or, may be owned pursuant to the applicable partnership agreement) directly or indirectly (other than through a UxxPDSxxPD corporation) by any person that is not a United States Tax Person, is a foreign permanent establishment or fixed base, within the meaning of any applicable income tax treaty, of any United States Tax Person, or is a Person with respect to which income on the Residual Certificate is attributable to a foreign permanent establishment or fixed base, within the meaning of any applicable income tax treaty.



 5.           The Transferor does not know and has no reason to know that the Transferee will not honor the restrictions on subsequent transfers by the Transferee under the Transfer Affidavit and Agreement, delivered in connection with this transfer.

In all cases the most current DSCR provided by the Master Servicer is used. To the extent that no DSCR is provided by the Master Servicer, information from the offering document is used. The DSCRs reported by the Master Servicer may be based on a period of less than 12 months. Regardless, DSCRs are normalized based on the Most Recent Financial as of Start and End Dates as reported on the NOI Detail page of this statement. The Certificate Administrator makes no representations as to the accuracy of the data provided by the borrower for this calculation.    (4) Debt Yield Ratios are calculated using the ending scheduled loan balance and the most current NOI provided by the Master Servicer. If no NOI information is provided by the Master Servicer, the NOI provided in the prospectus supplement is used. The NOI reported by the Master Servicer may be based on a period of less than 12 months. When this is the case, the NOI is annualized using the Most Recent Financial as of Start and End Dates as reported on the NOI Detail page of this statement.

The Transferee hereby certifies, represents and warrants to you, as the Depositor and the Master Servicer, that:



 1.           The Transferee is acquiring the right to receive Excess Servicing Fees (the "Excess Servicing Fee Right") for its own account for investment and not with a view to or for sale or transfer in connection with any distribution thereof, in whole or in part, in any manner which would violate the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), or any applicable state securities laws.

The Transferee understands that (a) the Excess Servicing Fee Right has not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act or registered or qualified under any applicable state securities laws, (b) none of the Depositor, the Trustee, Certificate Administrator or the Certificate Registrar is obligated so to register or qualify the Excess Servicing Fee Right, and (c) the Excess Servicing Fee Right may not be resold or transferred unless it is (i) registered

Neither the Transferee nor anyone acting on its behalf has (a) offered, pledged, sold, disposed of or otherwise transferred the Excess Servicing Fee Right, any interest in the Excess Servicing Fee Right or any other similar security to any person in any manner, (b) solicited any offer to buy or accept a pledge, disposition or other transfer of the Excess Servicing Fee Right, any interest in the Excess Servicing Fee Right or any other similar security from any person in any manner, (c) otherwise approached or negotiated with respect to the Excess Servicing Fee Right, any interest in the Excess Servicing Fee Right or any other similar security with any person in any manner, (d) made any general solicitation with respect to the Excess Servicing Fee Right, any interest in the Excess Servicing Fee Right or any other similar security by means of general advertising or in any other manner, or (e) taken any other action with respect to the Excess Servicing Fee Right, any interest in the Excess Servicing Fee Right or any other similar security, which (in the case of any of the acts described in clauses (a) through (e) above) would constitute a distribution of the Excess Servicing Fee Right under the Securities Act, would render the disposition of the Excess Servicing Fee Right a violation of Section 5 of the Securities Act or any state securities law or would require registration or qualification of the Excess Servicing Fee Right pursuant thereto.  The Transferee will not act, nor has it authorized or will it authorize any person to act, in any manner set forth in the foregoing sentence with respect to the Excess Servicing Fee Right, any interest in the Excess Servicing Fee Right or any other similar security.

The Transferee agrees (i) to keep all information relating to the Trust, the Trust Fund and the parties to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, and made available to it, confidential, (ii) not to use or disclose such information in any manner which could result in a violation of any provision of the Securities Act or would require registration of the Excess Servicing Fee Right or any Certificate pursuant to the Securities Act, and (iii) not to disclose such information, and to cause its officers, directors, partners, employees, agents or representatives not to disclose such information, in any manner whatsoever, in whole or in part, to any other Person other than such holder's auditors, legal counsel and regulators, except to the extent such disclosure is required by law, court order or other legal requirement or to the extent such information is of public knowledge at the time of disclosure by such holder or has become generally available to the public other than as a result of disclosure by such holder; provided, however, that such holder may provide all or any part of such information to any other Person who is contemplating an acquisition of the Excess Servicing Fee Right if, and only if, such Person (x) confirms in writing such prospective acquisition and (y) agrees in writing to keep such information confidential, not to use or disclose such information in any manner which could result in a violation of any provision of the Securities Act or would require registration of the Excess Servicing Fee Right or any Certificates pursuant to the Securities Act and not to disclose such information, and to cause its officers, directors, partners, employees, agents or representatives not to disclose such information, in any manner whatsoever, in whole or in part, to any other Person other than such Persons' auditors, legal counsel and regulators.
