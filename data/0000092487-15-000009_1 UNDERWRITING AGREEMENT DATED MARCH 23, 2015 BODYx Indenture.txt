Free Writing Prospectuses:     (a)   The Company represents and agrees that, without the prior consent of the Representatives, it has not made and will not make any offer relating to the Notes that would constitute a "free writing prospectus" as defined in Rule 405 under the Act, other than a Permitted Free Writing Prospectus; each Underwriter, severally and not jointly, represents and agrees that, without the prior consent of the Company and the Representatives, it has not made and will not make any offer relating to the Notes that would constitute a "free writing prospectus," as defined in Rule 405 under the Act, other than a Permitted Free Writing Prospectus or one or more free writing prospectuses that contain only preliminary or final terms of the Notes (which may include prices of bonds from comparable issuers) and is not required to be filed by the Company pursuant to Rule 433 or one or more free writing prospectuses that contains information substantially the same as the information contained in the free writing prospectus, dated the date hereof, filed pursuant to Rule 433(d) of the Act relating to the Notes (the Pricing Term Sheet); any such free writing prospectus the use of which has been consented to by the Company and the Representatives (which shall include the Pricing Term Sheet discussed in Section 6(b)) is listed in Exhibit 2 and herein called a "Permitted Free Writing Prospectus."     (b)   The Company agrees to prepare the Pricing Term Sheet, which shall be previously approved by the Representatives, and to file the Pricing Term Sheet pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Act within the time period prescribed by such Rule.     (c)   The Company and each Underwriter have complied and will comply with the requirements of Rule 433 under the Act applicable to any other Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, including timely Commission filing where required and legending.     (d)   The Company and each Underwriter agree that if at any time following issuance         of a Permitted Free Writing Prospectus any event occurred or occurs as a result of which such Permitted Free Writing Prospectus would conflict in any material respect with the information in the Registration Statement, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus or include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances then prevailing, not misleading, then (i) the party that first becomes aware of the foregoing will give prompt notice thereof to the Representatives and/ or the Company, as applicable, and, (ii) if requested by the Representatives or the Company, as applicable, the Company will prepare and furnish without charge a Permitted Free Writing Prospectus or other document which will correct such conflict, statement or omission.     (e)   Each Underwriter agrees that (i) no information that is conveyed to investors by such Underwriter has been or will be inconsistent with the information contained in the Pricing Disclosure Package, and (ii) if any Underwriter shall use a free writing prospectus that contains information in addition to, or in conflict with, the Pricing Disclosure Package, the liability arising from its use of such additional or conflicting information shall be the sole responsibility of such Underwriter using such free writing prospectus; provided, however, that, for the avoidance of doubt, this clause 6(e)(ii) shall not be interpreted as tantamount to the indemnification obligations contained in Section 8(b) hereof. 7.    Warranties of Underwriters: Each Underwriter warrants and represents that the information furnished in writing to the Company through the Representatives for use in the Registration Statement, in the Basic Prospectus, in any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, in the Pricing Prospectus, in the Prospectus, or in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented is correct as to such Underwriter. The warranties and representations of such Underwriter contained in this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the Company or other person, and shall survive the delivery of and payment for the Notes hereunder. 8.    Indemnification and Contribution:     (a)   To the extent permitted by law, the Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, each Underwriter's employees, agents, officers and directors and each person, if any, who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act, against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which an Underwriter, they or any of you or them may become subject under the Act or otherwise, and to reimburse the Underwriters, they or any of you or them, for any legal or other expenses incurred by you or them in connection with defending any action, insofar as such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or actions arise out of or are based upon any alleged untrue statement or untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, in the Basic Prospectus (if used prior to the effective date of this Agreement), in the Pricing Prospectus, in any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, in any "issuer free         writing prospectus" (as defined in Rule 433 under the Act) or in the Prospectus, or if the Company shall furnish or cause to be furnished to the Underwriters any amendments or any supplements to the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, in the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus as so amended or supplemented except to the extent that such amendments or supplements relate solely to securities other than the Notes (provided that if such Prospectus or such Prospectus, as amended or supplemented, is used after the period of time referred to in Section 4(b) hereof, it shall contain such amendments or supplements as the Company deems necessary to comply with Section 10(a) of the Act), or arise out of or are based upon any alleged omission or omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or actions arise out of or are based upon any such alleged untrue statement or omission, or untrue statement or omission which was made in the Registration Statement, in the Basic Prospectus, in the Pricing Prospectus, in any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, in any "issuer free writing prospectus" (as defined in Rule 433 under the Act) or in the Prospectus, or in the Prospectus as so amended or supplemented, in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company by or through the Representatives expressly for use therein or with any statements in or omissions from that part of the Registration Statement that shall constitute the Statement of Eligibility under the Trust Indenture Act of the Trustee under the Indenture. Each Underwriter agrees promptly after its receipt of written notice of the commencement of any action in respect to which indemnity from the Company on account of its agreement contained in this Section 8(a) may be sought by any such Underwriter, or by any person controlling any such Underwriter, to notify the Company in writing of the commencement thereof, but the omission so to notify the Company of any such action shall not release the Company from any liability which it may have to an Underwriter or to such controlling person otherwise than on account of the indemnity agreement contained in this Section 8(a). In case any such action shall be brought against an Underwriter or any such controlling person and an Underwriter shall notify the Company of the commencement thereof, as above provided, the Company shall be entitled to participate in, and, to the extent that it shall wish, including the selection of counsel (such counsel to be reasonably acceptable to the indemnified party), to direct the defense thereof at its own expense. In case the Company elects to direct such defense and select such counsel (hereinafter, Company's counsel), an Underwriter or any controlling person shall have the right to employ its own counsel, but, in any such case, the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at such Underwriter's or controlling person's expense unless (i) the Company has agreed in writing to pay such fees and expenses or (ii) the named parties to any such action (including any impleaded parties) include both an Underwriter or any controlling person and the Company and such Underwriter or any controlling person shall have been advised by its counsel that a conflict of interest between the Company and such Underwriter or any controlling person may arise (and the Company's counsel shall have concurred in good faith with such advice) and for this reason it is not desirable for the         Company's counsel to represent both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party (it being understood, however, that the Company shall not, in connection with any one such action or separate but substantially similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys for the Underwriters or any controlling person (plus any local counsel retained by the Underwriters or any controlling person in their reasonable judgment), which firm (or firms) shall be designated in writing by the Underwriters or any controlling person).     (b)   Each Underwriter agrees, to the extent permitted by law, severally and not jointly, to indemnify, hold harmless and reimburse the Company, its directors and such of its officers as shall have signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act, to the same extent and upon the same terms as the indemnity agreement of the Company set forth in Section 8(a) hereof, but only with respect to untrue statements or alleged untrue statements or omissions or alleged omissions made in the Registration Statement, or in the Basic Prospectus (if used prior to the effective date of this Agreement), or in the Pricing Prospectus, or in any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, or in the Prospectus, or in the Prospectus as so amended or supplemented, in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company by the Representatives on behalf of such Underwriter expressly for use therein. The Company agrees promptly after the receipt by it of written notice of the commencement of any action in respect to which indemnity from you on account of your agreement contained in this Section 8(b) may be sought by the Company, or by any person controlling the Company, to notify you in writing of the commencement thereof, but the Company's omission so to notify you of any such action shall not release you from any liability which you may have to the Company or to such controlling person otherwise than on account of the indemnity agreement contained in this Section 8(b).     (c)   If recovery is not available or insufficient to hold the indemnified party harmless under Section 8(a) or 8(b) hereof for any reason other than as specified therein, the indemnified party shall be entitled to contribution for any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses for which such indemnification is so unavailable or insufficient under this Section 8(c). In determining the amount of contribution to which such indemnified party is entitled, there shall be considered the portion of the proceeds of the offering of the Notes realized by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand, the relative knowledge and access to information concerning the matter with respect to which the claim was asserted, the opportunity to correct and prevent any statement or omission, and any equitable considerations appropriate under the circumstances. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be equitable if the amount of such contribution were determined by pro rata or per         capita allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) without reference to the considerations called for in the previous sentence. No Underwriter or any person controlling such Underwriter shall be obligated to contribute any amount or amounts hereunder which in the aggregate exceeds the total price of the Notes purchased by such Underwriter under this Agreement, less the aggregate amount of any damages which such Underwriter and its controlling persons have otherwise been required to pay in respect of the same claim or any substantially similar claim. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. An Underwriter's obligation to contribute under this Section 8 is in proportion to its purchase obligation and not joint with any other Underwriter.     (d)   No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever in respect of which indemnification or contribution could be sought under this Section 8 (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties thereto), unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such litigation, investigation, proceeding or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of such indemnified party.     (e)   In no event shall any indemnifying party have any liability or responsibility in respect of the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim effected without its prior written consent. The agreements contained in this Section 8 hereof shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any person, and shall survive the delivery of and payment for the Notes hereunder. 9.    Default of Underwriters: If any Underwriter under this Agreement shall fail or refuse (otherwise than for some reason sufficient to justify, in accordance with the terms hereof, the cancellation or termination of its obligations hereunder) to purchase and pay for the principal amount of Notes which it has agreed to purchase and pay for hereunder, and the aggregate principal amount of Notes which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase is not more than one-tenth of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes, the other Underwriters shall be obligated severally in the proportions which the amounts of Notes set forth opposite their names in Exhibit 1 hereto bear to the aggregate principal amount of Notes set forth opposite the names of all such non-defaulting Underwriters, to purchase the Notes which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase on the terms set forth herein; provided that in no event shall the principal amount of Notes which any Underwriter has agreed to purchase pursuant to Section 1 hereof be increased pursuant to this Section 9 by an amount in excess of one-ninth of such principal amount of Notes without the written consent of such Underwriter. If any Underwriter or Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Notes and the aggregate principal amount of Notes with respect to which such default occurs is more than one-tenth of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes then this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter; provided, however, that the non-defaulting Underwriters may agree, in their sole discretion, to purchase the Notes which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase on the terms set forth herein. In the event of any such termination, the Company shall not be under any liability to any Underwriter (except to the extent, if any, provided in Section 4(h) hereof), nor shall any Underwriter (other than an Underwriter who shall have failed or refused to purchase the Notes without some reason sufficient to justify, in accordance with the terms hereof, its termination of its obligations hereunder) be under any liability to the Company or any other Underwriter. Nothing herein contained shall release any defaulting Underwriter from its liability to the Company or any non-defaulting Underwriter for damages occasioned by its default hereunder. 10.    Termination of Agreement by the Underwriters: This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Time of Purchase by the Representatives if, after the execution and delivery of this Agreement and prior to the Time of Purchase, in the Representatives' reasonable judgment, the Underwriters' ability to market the Notes shall have been materially adversely affected because:         (i)   trading in securities on the New York Stock Exchange shall have been generally suspended by the Commission or by the New York Stock Exchange or trading in the securities of the Company shall have been suspended by the New York Stock Exchange, or         (ii)   there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities, declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war or other national or international calamity or crisis, or         (iii)   a general banking moratorium shall have been declared by Federal or New York State authorities, or         (iv)   there shall have been any decrease in the ratings of the Company's debt securities by Moody's Investors Services, Inc. (Moody's) or Standard & Poor's Ratings Group (S&P) or either Moody's or S&P shall publicly announce that it has such debt securities under consideration for possible further downgrade. If the Representatives elect to terminate this Agreement, as provided in this Section 10, the Representatives will promptly notify the Company by telephone or by telex or facsimile transmission, confirmed in writing. If this Agreement shall not be carried out by any Underwriter for any reason permitted hereunder, or if the sale of the Notes to the Underwriters as herein contemplated shall not be carried out because the Company is not able to comply with the terms hereof, the Company shall not be under any obligation under this Agreement and shall not be liable to any Underwriter or to any member of any selling group for the loss of anticipated profits from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (except that the Company shall remain liable to the extent provided in Section 4(h) hereof) and the Underwriters shall be under no liability to the Company nor be under any liability under this Agreement to one another. 11.
