   Ladies and Gentlemen:



   In my capacity as Counsel for ING Life Insurance and Annuity Company (the "Company"), I haveexamined the Registration Statement on Form N-4 in connection with the registration under the SecuritiesAct of 1933, as amended to the date hereof, of an indefinite number of units of interest in VariableAnnuity Account B of the Company (the "Account"). I am familiar with the proceedings taken andproposed to be taken in connection with the authorization, issuance and sale of units.



   Based upon my examination and upon my knowledge of the corporate activities relating to the Account, itis my opinion that:



   (1)

   The Company was organized in accordance with the laws of the State of Connecticut and is a dulyauthorized stock life insurance company under the laws of Connecticut and the laws of those statesin which the Company is admitted to do business;



   (2)

   The Account is a validly established separate investment account of the Company;



   (3)

   Under Connecticut law, the portion of the assets to be held in the Account equals the reserve andother liabilities for variable benefits under variable annuity contracts to be issued by the Account,and such assets are not chargeable with liabilities arising out of any other business the Companyconducts;



   (4)

   The units and the variable annuity contracts will, when issued and sold in the manner described inthe registration statement, be legal and binding obligations of the Company and will be legally andvalidly issued, fully paid, and non-assessable.



   I hereby consent to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit to the registration statement.



   Sincerely,
