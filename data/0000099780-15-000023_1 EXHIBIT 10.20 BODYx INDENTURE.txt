   This INDENTURE, dated as of November 5, 2009 (as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, this " Indenture "), by and between TRINITY RAIL LEASING VII LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, as the issuer of the Equipment Notes hereunder ( ''TRL-VII''  or the  "Issuer" ), and WILMINGTON TRUST COMPANY, a Delaware banking corporation, as indenture trustee for the Equipment Notes (the " Indenture Trustee "). WITNESSETH:      WHEREAS, the Issuer and the Indenture Trustee are executing and delivering this Indenture in order to provide for the issuance by the Issuer of the Equipment Notes, the terms of which shall be specified in this Indenture; and      WHEREAS, the obligations of the Issuer under the Equipment Notes issued pursuant to this Indenture and the other Secured Obligations shall be secured by the Collateral further granted and described below;      NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual agreements herein contained, and of other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows: GRANTING CLAUSES      The Issuer hereby pledges, transfers, assigns, and otherwise conveys to the Indenture Trustee for the benefit and security of the Noteholders and other Secured Parties, and grants to the Indenture Trustee for the benefit and security of the Noteholders and other Secured Parties a security interest in and Encumbrance on, all of the Issuer's assets, whether now existing or hereafter created or acquired and wherever located, including all right, title and interest, in, to and under the assets and property described below (collectively, the  "Collateral" ):           (a) each Issuer Document, in each case, as such agreements may be amended, amended and restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time (collectively, the  "Assigned Agreements" );           (b) (i) all Railcars described on Schedule 2 hereto, together with all other Railcars conveyed to the Issuer from time to time, whether pursuant to the Asset Transfer Agreement or otherwise, and any and all substitutions and replacements therefor, (ii) all licenses, manufacturer's warranties and other warranties, Supporting Obligations (including in respect of any related Lease), Payment Intangibles, Accounts, Instruments, Chattel Paper (including the Leases described on Schedule 3 hereto and any other related Leases of the Railcars and all related Lease Payments), General Intangibles and all other rights and obligations related to any such aforementioned Assigned Agreement, Railcars or Leases, including, without limitation, all rights, powers, privileges, options and other benefits of the Issuer to receive moneys and other property due and to become due under or pursuant to such Assigned Agreements, such Railcars or Leases, including, without limitation, all rights, powers, privileges, options and other benefits to receive and collect rental payments, income, revenues, profits and other amounts, payments, tenders or security (including any cash collateral) from any other party thereto (including, in the case of related Leases, from the Lessees thereunder), (iii) all rights, powers, privileges, options and other benefits of the Issuer to receive proceeds of any casualty insurance, condemnation

 which is included in such changed definitions which would not otherwise be included in the foregoing grant on the date hereof be included in such grant immediately upon the effective date of such revision.      The Indenture Trustee acknowledges such Security Interests, accepts the duties created hereby in accordance with the provisions hereof and agrees to hold and administer all Collateral for the use and benefit of all present and future Secured Parties.      The Issuer hereby irrevocably authorizes the Indenture Trustee at any time, and from time to time, to file, without the signature of the Issuer, in any filing office in any UCC jurisdiction necessary or desirable to perfect the Security Interests granted herein, any initial financing statements, continuation statements and amendments thereto that (i) indicate or describe the Collateral regardless of whether any particular asset constituting Collateral falls within the scope of Article 9 of the UCC in the same manner as described herein or in any other manner as the Indenture Trustee may determine in its sole discretion is necessary or desirable to ensure the perfection of the Security Interests granted herein, or (ii) provide any other information required by Article 9 of the UCC for the sufficiency or filing office acceptance of any financing statement, continuation statement or amendment, including whether the Issuer is an organization, the type of organization and any organization identification number issued to the Issuer. The Issuer agrees to furnish the information described in clause (ii) of the preceding sentence to the Indenture Trustee promptly upon the Indenture Trustee's request. Nothing in the foregoing shall be deemed to create an obligation of the Indenture Trustee to file any financing statement, continuation statements or amendment thereto.      Priority. The Issuer intends the Security Interests in favor of the Indenture Trustee to be prior to all other Encumbrances in respect of the Collateral, and the Issuer has taken and shall take or cause to be taken all actions necessary to obtain and maintain, in favor of the Indenture Trustee, for the benefit of the Noteholders and other Secured Parties, a first priority, perfected security interest in the Collateral, to the extent that perfection can be achieved by the filing of a UCC-1 financing statement in any UCC jurisdiction and/or other similar filings with the STB. With respect to Leases related to Portfolio Railcars where the Lessee thereunder is a Canadian resident, the Issuer has taken and shall take or cause to be taken all actions necessary or advisable to obtain and maintain, in favor of the Indenture Trustee, a first priority, perfected security interest in the related Railcars including, without limitation, making all such filings, registrations and recordings with the Registrar General of Canada as are necessary or advisable to obtain and maintain a first priority, perfected security interest in such Railcars and taking any actions that may be required by clause (C) of Section 2.2(e) of the Management Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer shall not be required to make any filings, registrations or recordation in Mexico. The Indenture Trustee shall have all of the rights, remedies and recourses with respect to the Collateral afforded a secured party under all applicable law in addition to, and not in limitation of, the other rights, remedies and recourses granted to the Indenture Trustee by this Indenture or any law relating to the creation and perfection of security interests in the Collateral.



 Continuance of Security.           (a) Except as otherwise provided under "Releases" below, the Security Interests created under this Indenture shall remain in force as continuing security to the Indenture Trustee, for the benefit of the Noteholders and other Secured Parties, until the repayment and performance in full of all Secured Obligations, notwithstanding any intermediate payment or satisfaction of any part of the Secured Obligations or any settlement of account or any other act, event or matter whatsoever, and shall secure Secured Obligations, including, without limitation, the ultimate balance of the moneys and liabilities hereby secured.           (b) No assurance, security or payment which may be avoided or adjusted under the law, including under any enactment relating to bankruptcy or insolvency and no release, settlement or discharge given or made by the Indenture Trustee on the faith of any such assurance, security or payment, shall prejudice or affect the right of the Indenture Trustee to recover the Secured Obligations from the Issuer (including any moneys which it may be compelled to pay or refund under the provisions of any applicable insolvency legislation of any applicable jurisdiction and any costs payable by it pursuant to or otherwise incurred in connection therewith) or to enforce the Security Interests granted under this Indenture to the full extent of the Secured Obligations and accordingly, if any release, settlement or discharge is or has been given hereunder and there is subsequently any such avoidance or adjustment under the law, it is expressly acknowledged and agreed that such release, settlement or discharge shall be void and of no effect whatsoever.           (c) If the Indenture Trustee shall have grounds in its absolute discretion acting in good faith for believing that the Issuer may be insolvent pursuant to the provisions of any applicable insolvency legislation in any relevant jurisdiction as at the date of any payment made by the Issuer to the Indenture Trustee ( provided  that the Indenture Trustee shall have no duty to inquire or investigate and shall not be deemed to have knowledge of same absent written notice received by a responsible officer of the Indenture Trustee), the Indenture Trustee shall retain the Security Interests contained in or created pursuant to this Indenture until the expiration of a period of one month plus such statutory period within which any assurance, security, guarantee or payment can be avoided or invalidated after the payment and discharge in full of all Secured Obligations notwithstanding any release, settlement, discharge or arrangement which may be given or made by the Indenture Trustee on, or as a consequence of, such payment or discharge of liability,  provided  that, if at any time within such period, the Issuer shall commence a voluntary winding-up or other voluntary case or other proceeding under any bankruptcy, reorganization, liquidation or insolvency law or statute now or hereafter in effect in any jurisdiction seeking liquidation, reorganization or other relief with respect to the Issuer or the Issuer's debts under any bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law now or hereafter in effect in any jurisdiction or seeking the appointment of an administrator, a trustee, receiver, liquidator, custodian or other similar official of the Issuer or any substantial part of its property or if the Issuer shall consent to any such relief or to the appointment of or taking possession by any such official in an involuntary case or other proceeding commenced against the Issuer, or making a general assignment for the benefit of any creditor of the Issuer under any bankruptcy, reorganization, liquidation or insolvency law or statute now or hereafter in effect in any jurisdiction, the Indenture Trustee shall continue to retain such Security Interest for such further period as the Indenture Trustee may reasonably determine on advice of counsel and such Security Interest



 shall be deemed to have continued to have been held as security for the payment and discharge to the Indenture Trustee of all Secured Obligations.      No Transfer of Duties. The Security Interests granted hereby are granted as security only and shall not (i) transfer or in any way affect or modify, or relieve the Issuer from, any obligation to perform or satisfy any term, covenant, condition or agreement to be performed or satisfied by the Issuer under or in connection with this Indenture or any Issuer Document or any Collateral or (ii) impose any obligation on any of the Secured Parties or the Indenture Trustee to perform or observe any such term, covenant, condition or agreement or impose any liability on any of the Secured Parties or the Indenture Trustee for any act or omission on the part of the Issuer relative thereto or for any breach of any representation or warranty on the part of the Issuer contained therein or made in connection therewith unless otherwise expressly provided therein.      Collateral.           (a) Generally. On the Closing Date, all Instruments, Chattel Paper, Securities or other documents, including, without limitation, any Chattel Paper Originals evidencing the initial Leases described on Schedule 3 hereto and SUBI Certificates, representing or evidencing Collateral shall be delivered to and held by or on behalf of the Indenture Trustee on behalf of the Secured Parties pursuant hereto all in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Indenture Trustee. Subject to subsections (c) and (d) under this heading, until the termination of the Security Interest granted hereby, if the Issuer shall acquire (by purchase, contribution, substitution, replacement or otherwise) any additional Collateral evidenced by Instruments or Chattel Paper at any time or from time to time after the date hereof, the Issuer shall promptly pledge and deposit the Collateral so evidenced as security for the Secured Obligations with the Indenture Trustee and deliver same to the custodial possession of the Indenture Trustee, and the Indenture Trustee shall accept under this Indenture such delivery.           (b) Safekeeping. The Indenture Trustee agrees to maintain the Collateral received by it (including possession of the Chattel Paper Originals) and all records and documents relating thereto at such address or addresses as may from time to time be specified by the Indenture Trustee in writing to each Secured Party and the Issuer. The Indenture Trustee shall keep all Collateral and related documentation in its possession separate and apart from all other property that it is holding in its possession and from its own general assets and shall maintain accurate records pertaining to the Permitted Investments and Indenture Accounts included in the Collateral in such a manner as shall enable the Indenture Trustee, the Secured Parties and the Issuer to verify the accuracy of such record keeping. The Indenture Trustee's books and records shall at all times show that to the extent that any Collateral is held by the Indenture Trustee such Collateral shall be held as agent of and custodian for the Secured Parties and is not the property of the Indenture Trustee. The Indenture Trustee will promptly report to each Secured Party and the Issuer any failure on its part to hold the Collateral as provided in this subsection and will promptly take appropriate action to remedy any such failure.           (c) Limitations on Common Schedules and Riders. On and after the date hereof, the Issuer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause all Portfolio Railcars which are subject to a Lease (or become subject to a Lease pursuant to the exercise of any replacement, substitution or remarketing rights of the Issuer under the Operative Agreements) to be identified



 in separate executed Schedules or Riders to the related "master lease agreement" with the applicable Lessee such that only Portfolio Railcars are identified on the applicable Schedules or Riders and no railcars are identified thereon which are owned by any Person other than the Issuer (such other party, a  "Non-Indenture Party" );  provided, however , that to the extent the separateness of such Schedule or Rider cannot be maintained, (i) in no event shall the percentage of Portfolio Railcars in the aggregate (measured by Adjusted Value) contained on Schedules or Riders which also include railcars owned by a Non-Indenture Party exceed 20% of the Portfolio Railcars in the aggregate (measured by Adjusted Value) and (ii) in all cases in which Schedules or Riders contain Portfolio Railcars together with other railcars owned by a Non-Indenture Party, the applicable Lessee(s) shall have agreed, if requested by the Indenture Trustee acting at the Direction of the Requisite Majority (which request may only be made in connection with the exercise of remedies against such Portfolio Railcars), to re-execute one or more separate Schedules or Riders for such Portfolio Railcars and other applicable railcars such that the Schedules and Riders identifying the Portfolio Railcars do not identify any railcars other than such Portfolio Railcars.           (d) Custody of Leases. Upon the written request of the Issuer, in the event that the separateness of Schedules or Riders cannot be maintained as aforesaid, the parties hereto agree to implement a custodial arrangement with respect to Leases related to Portfolio Railcars whereby Wilmington Trust Company, as custodian (or any other financial institution or trust company reasonably satisfactory to the parties hereto) will maintain custody of the original of such Leases (including all such non-separate Schedules and Riders) for the benefit of the Secured Parties and any Non-Indenture Party with an interest therein, as their interests may appear. Such custodial arrangement will be evidenced by a custodial agreement to contain terms and conditions reasonably satisfactory to the Issuer and the Indenture Trustee.           (e) Notifications. The Indenture Trustee at the expense of the Issuer shall promptly forward to the Issuer and the Manager a copy of each notice, request, report, or other document relating to any Issuer Document included in the Collateral that is received by a Responsible Officer of the Indenture Trustee from any Person other than the Issuer or the Manager on and after the Closing Date.      Releases.

In furtherance of the foregoing, the Issuer hereby irrevocably appoints the Indenture Trustee as its attorney-in-fact to exercise all rights described in this Granting Clause provision in its place and stead. ARTICLE I DEFINITIONS      Section 1.01 Definitions.      For purposes of this Indenture, the terms set forth on Annex A hereto shall have the meanings indicated on such Annex A.

 ARTICLE II THE EQUIPMENT NOTES      Section 2.01 Authorization, Issuance and Authentication of the Equipment Notes; Amount of Outstanding Principal Balance; Terms; Form; Execution and Delivery.           (a) There is hereby created a series of Equipment Notes designated as set forth in the definition of the term Equipment Notes herein. The aggregate principal balance of the Equipment Notes as of their date of issuance on the Closing Date is $238,262,640.           (b) The Equipment Notes to be issued on the Closing Date shall be executed by the Issuer and delivered to the Indenture Trustee for authentication and the Indenture Trustee shall authenticate and deliver the Equipment Notes upon the Issuer's request and direction set forth in an Officer's Certificate of the Issuer signed by one of its authorized signatories, without further action on the part of the Issuer. Any such authentication may be made on separate counterparts and by facsimile.           (c) There shall be issued, delivered and authenticated on the Closing Date to each of the Noteholders identified on such Equipment Notes, Equipment Notes in the principal amounts and maturities and bearing the interest rates set forth thereon (or incorporated by reference therein from this Indenture), in each case in registered form and substantially in the form set forth on Exhibit A, with such appropriate insertions, omissions, substitutions and other variations as are required or permitted by this Indenture, and may have such letters, numbers or other marks of identification and such legends or endorsements printed, lithographed, typewritten or engraved thereon, as may be required to comply with the rules of any securities exchange on which such Equipment Notes may be listed or to conform to any usage in respect thereof, or as may, consistently herewith, be prescribed by the Indenture Trustee executing such Equipment Notes, such determination by said Indenture Trustee to be evidenced by its authentication of such Equipment Notes. Definitive Notes shall be printed, lithographed, typewritten or engraved or produced by any combination of these methods or may be produced in any other manner permitted by the rules of any securities exchange on which the Equipment Notes may be listed, all as determined by the Indenture Trustee authenticating such Equipment Notes, as evidenced by such authentication.           (i) Equipment Notes sold in reliance on Rule 144A shall be represented by a single permanent 144A Book-Entry Note which will be deposited with DTC or its custodian, the Indenture Trustee or an agent of the Indenture Trustee and registered in the name of Cede as nominee of DTC.           (ii) Equipment Notes offered and sold outside of the United States in reliance on Regulation S shall be represented by a Regulation S Temporary Book-Entry Note, which will be deposited with the Indenture Trustee or an agent of the Indenture Trustee as custodian for and registered in the name of Cede, as nominee of DTC. Beneficial interests in each Regulation S Temporary Book-Entry Note may be held only through Euroclear or Clearstream;  provided, however,  that such interests may be



 exchanged for interests in a 144A Book-Entry Note or a Definitive Note in accordance with the certification requirements described in Section 2.07 hereof.           (iii) A beneficial owner of an interest in a Regulation S Temporary Book-Entry Note may receive payments in respect of such Regulation S Temporary Book-Entry Notes only after delivery to Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, of a written certification substantially in the form set forth in Exhibit B-1 to this Indenture, and upon delivery by Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, to the Indenture Trustee and Note Registrar of a certification or certifications substantially in the form set forth in Exhibit B-2 to this Indenture. The delivery by a beneficial owner of the certification referred to above shall constitute its irrevocable instruction to Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, to arrange for the exchange of the beneficial owner's interest in the Regulation S Temporary Book-Entry Note for a beneficial interest in the Unrestricted Book-Entry Note after the Exchange Date in accordance with the paragraph below.           (iv) Not earlier than the Exchange Date, interests in each Regulation S Temporary Book-Entry Note will be exchangeable for interests in the related permanent global note (an " Unrestricted Book-Entry Note "). Each Unrestricted Book-Entry Note will be deposited with the Indenture Trustee and registered in the name of Cede as nominee of DTC. After (1) the Exchange Date and (2) receipt by the Indenture Trustee and Note Registrar of written instructions from Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, directing the Indenture Trustee and Note Registrar to credit or cause to be credited to either Euroclear's or Clearstream's, as the case may be, depositary account a beneficial interest in the Unrestricted Book-Entry Note in a principal amount not greater than that of the beneficial interest in the Regulation S Temporary Book-Entry Note, the Indenture Trustee and Note Registrar shall instruct DTC to reduce the principal amount of the Regulation S Temporary Book-Entry Note and increase the principal amount of the Unrestricted Book-Entry Note, in each case by the principal amount of the beneficial interest in the Regulation S Temporary Book-Entry Note to be so transferred, and to credit or cause to be credited to the account of a Direct Participant a beneficial interest in the Unrestricted Book-Entry Note having a principal amount equal to the reduction in the principal amount of such Regulation S Temporary Book-Entry Note.           (v) Upon the exchange of the entire principal amount of the Regulation S Temporary Book-Entry Note for beneficial interests in the Unrestricted Book-Entry Note, the Indenture Trustee shall cancel the Regulation S Temporary Book-Entry Note in accordance with the Indenture Trustee's policies in effect from time to time.           (vi) No interest in the Regulation S Book-Entry Notes may be held by or transferred to a United States Person except for exchanges for a beneficial interest in a 144A Book-Entry Note or a Definitive Note as described below.           (d) The Equipment Notes shall be executed on behalf of the Issuer by the manual or facsimile signature of an Authorized Representative of the Issuer.



      (e) Each Equipment Note bearing the manual or facsimile signatures of any individual who was at the time such Equipment Note was executed an Authorized Representative of the Issuer shall bind the Issuer, notwithstanding that any such individual has ceased to hold such office prior to the authentication and delivery of such Equipment Notes or any payment thereon.      (f) No Equipment Note shall be entitled to any benefit under this Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose, unless it shall have been executed on behalf of the Issuer as provided in clause (c) and (e) above and authenticated by or on behalf of the Indenture Trustee as provided in clause (c) above. Such signatures shall be conclusive evidence that such Equipment Note has been duly executed and authenticated under this Indenture. Each Equipment Note shall be dated the date of its authentication.      Section 2.02 Restrictive Legends.      Except as specified in Section 2.11(g) hereof, each 144A Book-Entry Note, each Regulation S Temporary Book-Entry Note, each Unrestricted Book-Entry Note and each Definitive Note (and all Equipment Notes issued in exchange therefor or upon registration of transfer or substitution thereof) shall bear the following legend on the face thereof:      THIS NOTE HAS NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE "SECURITIES ACT") OR ANY STATE SECURITIES OR "BLUE SKY" LAWS.

For so long as the Equipment Notes are listed on any stock exchange, the Issuer shall appoint and maintain a Paying Agent and a Note Registrar in the jurisdiction in which such stock exchange is located. The Issuer shall cause each Note Registrar to keep a register of the Equipment Notes for which it is acting as Note Registrar and of their transfer and exchange (the " Register "). Written notice of



 the location of each such other office or agency and of any change of location thereof shall be given by the Indenture Trustee to the Issuer and the Holders of the Equipment Notes. In the event that no such office or agency shall be maintained or no such notice of location or of change of location shall be given, presentations and demands may be made and notices may be served at the Corporate Trust Office of the Indenture Trustee. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Indenture, the entries in the Register shall be conclusive, in the absence of manifest error, and the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee, and Noteholder shall treat each Person in whose name an Equipment Note is registered as the beneficial owner thereof for all purposes of this Indenture. No transfer of an Equipment Note shall be effective unless such transfer has been recorded in the Register as provided in this Section.           (b) Each Authorized Agent in the location set forth in Section 13.04 shall be a bank or trust company, shall be a corporation organized and doing business under the laws of the United States or any state or territory thereof or of the District of Columbia, with a combined capital and surplus of at least $75,000,000 (or having a combined capital and surplus in excess of $5,000,000 and the obligations of which, whether now in existence or hereafter incurred, are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by a corporation organized and doing business under the laws of the United States, any state or territory thereof or of the District of Columbia and having a combined capital and surplus of at least $75,000,000) and shall be authorized under the laws of the United States or any state or territory thereof to exercise corporate trust powers, subject to supervision by Federal or state authorities (such requirements, the " Eligibility Requirements ").

The Issuer may, and at the request of the Indenture Trustee shall, at any time terminate the agency of any Authorized Agent by giving written notice of termination to such Authorized Agent and to the Indenture Trustee. Upon the resignation or termination of an Authorized Agent or if at any time any such Authorized Agent shall cease to be eligible under this Section (when, in either case, no other Authorized Agent performing the functions of such Authorized Agent shall have been appointed by the Indenture Trustee), the Issuer shall promptly appoint one or more qualified successor Authorized Agents to perform the functions of the Authorized Agent that has resigned or whose agency has been terminated or who shall have ceased to be eligible under this Section. The Issuer shall give written notice of any such appointment made by it to the Indenture Trustee; and in each case the



 Indenture Trustee shall mail notice of such appointment to all Holders of the Equipment Notes as their names and addresses appear on the Register for the Equipment Notes.           (e) The Issuer agrees to pay, or cause to be paid, from time to time reasonable compensation to each Authorized Agent for its services and to reimburse it for its reasonable expenses to be agreed to pursuant to separate agreements with each such Authorized Agent.      Section 2.04 Paying Agent to Hold Money in Trust.      The Indenture Trustee shall require each Paying Agent other than the Indenture Trustee to agree in writing that all moneys deposited with any Paying Agent for the purpose of any payment on the Equipment Notes shall be deposited and held in trust for the benefit of the Holders entitled to such payment, subject to the provisions of this Section.

Each such payment on any Payment Date other than the final payment with respect to the Equipment Notes shall be made by the Indenture Trustee or Paying Agent to the Noteholders as of the Record Date for such Payment Date. The final payment with respect to any Equipment Note, however, shall be made only upon presentation and surrender of such Equipment Note by the Noteholder or its agent at the Corporate Trust Office or agency of the Indenture Trustee or Paying Agent specified in the notice given by the Indenture Trustee or Paying Agent with respect to such final payment.           (b) At such time, if any, as the Equipment Notes are issued in the form of Definitive Notes, payments on a Payment Date shall be made by check mailed to each Noteholder of a Definitive Note on the applicable Record Date at its address appearing on the Register maintained with respect to the Equipment Notes.

No interest, principal or premium shall be paid to any beneficial owner and no interest, principal or premium shall be paid to Euroclear or Clearstream on such beneficial owner's interest in a Regulation S Temporary Book-Entry Note unless Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, has provided such a certification to the Paying Agent with respect to such interest, principal and/or premium.      Section 2.06 Minimum Denomination.      Each Equipment Note shall be issued in minimum denominations of $100,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof;  provided  that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, one Equipment Note may be issued with such excess in integral multiples of $10.      Section 2.07 Exchange Option.      If the holder (other than the Purchaser) of a beneficial interest in an Unrestricted Book-Entry Note deposited with DTC wishes at any time to exchange its interest in the Unrestricted Book-Entry Note, or to transfer its interest in the Unrestricted Book-Entry Note to a Person who wishes to take delivery thereof in the form of an interest in the 144A Book-Entry Note, the holder may, subject to the rules and procedures of Euroclear or Clearstream and DTC, as the case may be, give directions for the Indenture Trustee and Note Registrar to exchange or cause the exchange or transfer or cause the transfer of the interest for an equivalent beneficial interest in the 144A Book-Entry Note. Upon receipt by the Indenture Trustee and Note Registrar of (a) instructions from Euroclear or Clearstream (based on instructions from depositaries for Euroclear and Clearstream) or from a DTC Participant, as applicable, or DTC, as the case may be, directing the Indenture Trustee and Note Registrar to credit or cause to be credited a beneficial interest in the 144A Book-Entry Note equal to the beneficial interest in the Unrestricted Book-Entry Note to be exchanged or transferred (such instructions to contain information regarding the DTC Participant account to be credited with the increase, and, with respect to an exchange or transfer of an interest in the Unrestricted Book-Entry Note, information regarding the DTC Participant account to be debited with the decrease), and (b) a certificate in the form of Exhibit B-8, given by the Noteholder (and the proposed transferee, if applicable), the Indenture Trustee and Note



 Registrar shall instruct DTC to reduce the Unrestricted Book-Entry Note by the aggregate principal amount of the beneficial interest in the Unrestricted Book-Entry Note to be exchanged or transferred, and the Indenture Trustee shall instruct DTC, concurrently with the reduction, to increase the principal amount of the 144A Book-Entry Note by the aggregate principal amount of the beneficial interest in the Unrestricted Book-Entry Note to be so exchanged or transferred, and to credit or cause to be credited to the account of the Person specified in the instructions a beneficial interest in the 144A Book-Entry Note equal to the reduction in the principal amount of the Unrestricted Book-Entry Note.      If a holder (other than the Purchaser) of a beneficial interest in the 144A Book-Entry Note wishes at any time to exchange its interest in the 144A Book-Entry Note for an interest in a Regulation S Book-Entry Note, or to transfer its interest in the 144A Book-Entry Note to a Person who wishes to take delivery thereof in the form of an interest in the Regulation S Book-Entry Note, the holder may, subject to the rules and procedures of DTC, give directions for the Indenture Trustee and Note Registrar to exchange or cause the exchange or transfer or cause the transfer of the interest for an equivalent beneficial interest in the Regulation S Book-Entry Note.

Upon receipt of the instructions provided in the preceding sentence, the Indenture Trustee and Note Registrar shall instruct DTC to reduce the principal amount of the Regulation S Temporary Book-Entry Note to be so transferred and shall instruct DTC to increase the principal amount of the 144A Book-Entry Note and credit or cause to be credited to the account of the placement agent a beneficial interest in the 144A Book-Entry Note having a principal amount equal to the amount by which the principal amount of the Regulation S Temporary Book-Entry Note was reduced upon the transfer pursuant to the instructions provided in the first sentence of this paragraph.



      If a Book-Entry Note is exchanged for a Definitive Note, such Equipment Notes may be exchanged or transferred for one another only in accordance with such procedures as are substantially consistent with the provisions of the three immediately preceding paragraphs (including the certification requirements intended to ensure that the exchanges or transfers comply with Rule 144 or Regulation S, as the case may be) and as may be from time to time adopted by the Indenture Trustee.      Section 2.08 Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost or Stolen Equipment Notes.      If any Equipment Note shall become mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen, the Issuer shall issue, upon the written request of the Holder thereof and presentation of the Equipment Note or satisfactory evidence of destruction, loss or theft thereof to the Indenture Trustee or Note Registrar, and the Indenture Trustee shall authenticate and the Indenture Trustee or Note Registrar shall deliver in exchange therefor or in replacement thereof, a new Equipment Note, payable to such Holder in the same principal amount, of the same maturity, with the same payment schedule, bearing the same interest rate and dated the date of its authentication. If the Equipment Note being replaced has become mutilated, such Equipment Note shall be surrendered to the Indenture Trustee or a Note Registrar and forwarded to the Issuer by the Indenture Trustee or such Note Registrar. If the Equipment Note being replaced has been destroyed, lost or stolen, the Holder thereof shall furnish to the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee or a Note Registrar (i) such security or indemnity as may be required by them to save the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee and such Note Registrar harmless and (ii) evidence satisfactory to the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee and such Note Registrar of the destruction, loss or theft of such Equipment Note and of the ownership thereof. The Noteholder will be required to pay any tax or other governmental charge imposed in connection with such exchange or replacement and any other expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Indenture Trustee and any Note Registrar) connected therewith.      Section 2.09 Payments of Transfer Taxes.      Upon the transfer of any Equipment Note or Equipment Notes pursuant to Section 2.07 hereof, the Issuer or the Indenture Trustee may require from the party requesting such new Equipment Note or Equipment Notes payment of a sum to reimburse the Issuer or the Indenture Trustee for, or to provide funds for the payment of, any transfer tax or similar governmental charge payable in connection therewith.      Section 2.10 Book-Entry Registration.           (a) Upon the issuance of any Book-Entry Notes, DTC or its custodian will credit, on its book-entry registration and transfer system, the respective principal amounts of the individual beneficial interests represented by such Book-Entry Notes to the accounts of a Direct Participant. Ownership of beneficial interests in a Book-Entry Note will be limited to DTC Participants or Persons who hold interests through DTC Participants. Ownership of beneficial interests in the Book-Entry Notes will be shown on, and the transfer of that ownership will be effected only through, records maintained by DTC (with respect to interests of DTC Participants) and the records of DTC Participants (with respect to interests of Persons other than DTC Participants).



           (b) So long as DTC, or its nominee, is the registered owner or holder of a Book-Entry Note, DTC or such nominee, as the case may be, will be considered the sole owner or Noteholder represented by such Book-Entry Note for all purposes under this Indenture, and the Book-Entry Notes. Unless (a) DTC notifies the Issuer that it is unwilling or unable to continue as depository for a Book-Entry Note, (b) the Issuer elects to terminate the book-entry system for the Book-Entry Notes, or (c) an Event of Default has occurred and the Indenture Trustee acting at the Direction of a Requisite Majority certifies that continuation of a book-entry system through DTC (or a successor) for the Equipment Notes is no longer in the best interests of the Noteholders, owners of beneficial interests in a Book-Entry Note will not be entitled to have any portion of such Book-Entry Note registered in their names, will not receive or be entitled to receive physical delivery of Equipment Notes in definitive form and will not be considered to be the owners or Noteholders under this Indenture or the Book-Entry Notes. In addition, no beneficial owner of an interest in a Book-Entry Note will be able to transfer that interest except in accordance with DTC's applicable procedures (and in addition, if applicable, those of Clearstream and Euroclear).           (c) Investors may hold their interest in a Regulation S Book-Entry Note through Clearstream or Euroclear, if they are participants in such systems, or indirectly through organizations that are participants in such systems. After the Exchange Date, investors also may hold such interests through organizations other than Clearstream and Euroclear that are DTC Participants. Clearstream and Euroclear will hold interests in a Regulation S Book-Entry Note on behalf of their participants through customers' securities accounts in their respective names on the books of their respective depositaries, which in turn will hold such interests in a Regulation S Book-Entry Note in customers' accounts in the depositaries' names on the books of DTC. Citibank, NxxPDAxxPD will initially act as depositary for Clearstream and Morgan Guaranty Trust Company of New York, Brussels Office, will initially act as depositary for Euroclear. Investors may hold their interests in a 144A Book-Entry Note directly through DTC, if they are DTC Participants, or indirectly through organizations that are DTC Participants.           (d) All payments of principal and interest will be made by the Paying Agent on behalf of the Issuer in immediately available funds or the equivalent, so long as DTC continues to make its Same-Day Funds Settlement System available to the Issuer.      None of the Issuer, the Note Registrar, the Paying Agent or the Indenture Trustee shall be liable for any delay in delivery of such instructions and may conclusively rely on, and shall be fully protected in relying on, such registration instructions. Upon the issuance of Definitive Notes, the Indenture Trustee shall recognize the Persons in whose name the Definitive Notes are registered in the Register as Noteholders hereunder. Neither the Issuer nor the Indenture Trustee shall be liable if the Indenture Trustee or the Issuer is unable to locate a qualified successor Noteholder.      Definitive Notes will be transferable and exchangeable for Definitive Notes at the office of the Indenture Trustee or the office of a Note Registrar upon compliance with the requirements set forth herein. In the case of a transfer of only part of a holding of Definitive Notes, a new Definitive Note shall be issued to the transferee in respect of the part transferred and a new Definitive Note in respect of the balance of the holding not transferred shall be issued to the transferor and may be obtained at the office of the applicable Note Registrar.

      Section 3.13 Procedure for Redemptions.           (a) Method of Redemption. In the case of any Redemption, the Issuer will deposit, or will cause to be deposited, in the Redemption/Defeasance Account an amount equal to the Redemption Price of the Equipment Notes or portion thereof to be redeemed. Once a Redemption Notice in respect of a Redemption is published, the applicable outstanding principal amount of the Equipment Notes to which such Redemption Notice applies will become due and payable on the Redemption Date stated in such Redemption Notice at its Redemption Price. All Equipment Notes that are redeemed in full will be surrendered to the Indenture Trustee for cancellation and accordingly may not be reissued or resold.           (b) Deposit of Redemption Amount. On or before any Redemption Date in respect of a Redemption under Section 3.12, the Issuer shall, to the extent an amount equal to the Redemption Price of the Equipment Notes to be redeemed and any transaction expenses as of the Redemption Date is not then held by the Issuer or on deposit in the Redemption/Defeasance Account, deposit or cause to be deposited such amount in the Redemption/Defeasance Account.           (c) Equipment Notes Payable on Redemption Date. After notice has been given under Section 3.13(d) hereof as to the Redemption Date in respect of any Redemption, the Outstanding Principal Balance of the Equipment Notes to be redeemed on such Redemption Date in the amount identified in such notice shall become due and payable at the Corporate Trust Office of the Indenture Trustee, and from and after such Redemption Date (unless there shall be a default in the payment of the applicable amount to be redeemed) such principal amount shall cease to bear interest. Upon surrender of any Equipment Note for Redemption in accordance with such notice, the Redemption Price of such Equipment Note shall be paid as provided for in Section 3.11(d). If any Equipment Note to be redeemed shall not be so paid, or shall only be paid in part in accordance with the terms of such notice, the remaining Outstanding Principal Balance thereof shall continue to bear interest from the Redemption Date until paid at the interest rate applicable to such Equipment Note.           (d) Redemption Notice. In respect of any Redemption of the Equipment Notes to be made out of amounts available for such purposes, the Indenture Trustee will give a Redemption Notice to each holder of the Equipment Notes to be redeemed, provided  that the Indenture Trustee shall have determined in advance of giving any such Redemption Notice that funds are or will, on the Redemption Date, be available therefor. Such Redemption Notice will be given at least twenty (20) days but not more than sixty (60) days before such Redemption Date. Each Redemption Notice will state (i) the applicable Redemption Date, (ii) if a Redemption in part, the portion of the Outstanding Principal Balance of the Equipment Notes that is to be redeemed (and in respect thereof, the Redemption Price will be distributed to the Holders pro rata in the same manner as partial repayments of principal on the Equipment Notes made pursuant to the Flow of Funds and the Indenture Trustee's notice shall contain information to that effect), (iii) the Indenture Trustee's arrangements for making payments due on the Redemption Date, (iv) the Redemption Price of the Equipment Notes to be redeemed, (v) for an Optional Redemption in whole, that the Equipment Notes to be redeemed must be surrendered (which action may be taken by any Holder of the Equipment Notes or its authorized agent) to the Indenture Trustee to collect the Redemption Price on such Equipment Notes and (vi) that, unless the Issuer defaults in the payment of the Redemption Price, if any, interest on the portion of the



 Outstanding Principal Balance of the Equipment Notes called for Redemption will cease to accrue on and after the Redemption Date.      Section 3.14 Adjustments in Targeted Principal Balances.           (a) Railcar Dispositions. If Net Disposition Proceeds have been included in the Available Collections Amount on any Payment Date, then the Scheduled Targeted Principal Balance of the Equipment Notes for such Payment Date and for all subsequent Payment Dates will be equal to the product of (a) the Scheduled Adjustment Fraction for the Equipment Notes as of each such Payment Date and (b) the Scheduled Targeted Principal Balance of the Equipment Notes for each such Payment Date, as adjusted for Optional Redemptions as provided in Section 3.14(b) below but without giving effect to any previous adjustments made to such Scheduled Targeted Principal Balance pursuant to this Section 3.14(a).           (b) Optional Redemption. In connection with any Optional Redemption in part, the Scheduled Targeted Principal Balance for the Equipment Notes being redeemed on the applicable Redemption Date shall be reduced on the Redemption Date and each subsequent Payment Date by the product of (i) the Redemption Fraction and (ii) the Scheduled Targeted Principal Balance that existed for the Redemption Date or such subsequent Payment Date, as the case may be, immediately prior to such Optional Redemption. As used above:      "Redemption Fraction" means, for the Equipment Notes being subjected to an Optional Redemption, a fraction, the numerator of which is the principal amount of the Equipment Notes that is being prepaid in connection with such Optional Redemption and the denominator of which is the Outstanding Principal Balance immediately prior to such Optional Redemption. ARTICLE IV DEFAULT AND REMEDIES      Section 4.01 Events of Default.      Each of the following events shall constitute an "Event of Default" hereunder, and each such Event of Default shall be deemed to exist and continue so long as, but only so long as, it shall not have been remedied:           (a) failure to pay interest on the Equipment Notes then outstanding (other than Additional Interest, if any), in each case when such amount becomes due and payable, and such default continues for a period of five (5) or more Business Days;           (b) failure to make payment in full in cash of the then Outstanding Principal Balance of the Equipment Notes thereof by the Final Maturity Date;

However, with respect to any Future Lease entered into in connection with (x) the renewal or extension of a related Lease, (y) the leasing of a Portfolio Railcar to a Person that is or was a Lessee under a pre-existing Lease, or (z) the leasing of a Portfolio Railcar to a Person that is or



 was a Lessee under an operating lease of a Railcar that is being managed or serviced by the Manager (such Future Lease, a " Renewal Lease "), a form of lease substantially similar to such pre-existing Lease or operating lease (a " Precedent Lease "), as the case may be, may be used by the Manager, in lieu of the Pro Forma Lease on behalf of the Issuer as a starting point in the negotiation of such Future Lease. The terms of the Pro Forma Lease may be revised from time to time by the Manager,  provided  that any such revisions shall be consistent with a Lease originated thereunder being a Permitted Lease.           (f) Concentration Limits.

Also, the Issuer will not consummate a Permitted Discretionary Sale if the effect of such action is or would be to cause noncompliance with any Concentration Limit.      Section 5.04 Operating Covenants.      The Issuer covenants with the Indenture Trustee as follows, provided that any of the following covenants with respect to the Portfolio Railcars shall not be deemed to have been breached by virtue of any act or omission of a Lessee or sub-lessee, or of any Person which has possession of a Portfolio Railcar for the purpose of repairs, maintenance, modification or storage, or by virtue of any requisition, seizure, or confiscation of a Portfolio Railcar (other than seizure or confiscation arising from a breach by the Issuer of such covenant) (each, a  "Third Party Event" ), so long as (i) neither the Issuer nor the Manager has consented to such Third Party Event; and (ii) the Issuer (or the Manager on its behalf) as the Lessor of such Portfolio Railcar promptly and diligently takes such commercially reasonable actions as a leading railcar operating lessor would reasonably take in respect of such Third Party Event, including, as deemed appropriate (taking into account, among other things, the laws of the jurisdiction in which such Portfolio Railcar is located), seeking to compel such Lessee or other relevant Person to remedy such Third Party Event or seeking to repossess the relevant Portfolio Railcar:           (a) Ownership. The Issuer will (i) on all occasions on which the ownership of each Portfolio Railcar is relevant, make it clear to third parties that title to the same is held by the Issuer, and (ii) not do, or knowingly permit to be done, or omit, or knowingly permit to be omitted, any act or thing which might reasonably be expected to jeopardize the rights of the Issuer as owner of each Portfolio Railcar, except as contemplated by the Operative Agreements.           (b) Compliance with Law; Maintenance of Permits. The Issuer will (i) comply in all material respects with all Applicable Laws, (ii) obtain all material governmental (including regulatory) registrations, certificates, licenses, permits and authorizations required for the use and operation of the Portfolio Railcars owned by it, (iii) not cause or knowingly permit, directly or indirectly, any Lessee to operate any Portfolio Railcar under any related Lease in any material respect contrary to any Applicable Law, and (iv) not knowingly permit, directly or indirectly, any Lessee not to obtain all material governmental (including regulatory) registrations, certificates, licenses, permits and authorizations required for such Lessee's use and operation of any Portfolio Railcar under any related operating Lease.



           (c) Forfeiture. The Issuer will not do anything, and will not knowingly permit, directly or indirectly, any Lessee to do anything, which may reasonably be expected to expose any Portfolio Railcar to forfeiture, impoundment, detention, appropriation, damage or destruction (other than any forfeiture, impoundment, detention or appropriation which is being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings if (i) adequate resources have been made available by the Issuer or the applicable Lessee for any payment which may arise or be required in connection with such forfeiture, impounding, detention or appropriation or proceedings taken in respect thereof, and (ii) such forfeiture, impounding, detention or appropriation or the continued existence thereof does not give rise to any material likelihood of the assets to which such forfeiture, impounding, detention or appropriation relates or any interest in such assets being sold, permanently forfeited or otherwise lost). In the event of a forfeiture, impoundment, detention or appropriation of such Portfolio Railcar not constituting a Total Loss, the Issuer will use all commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the prompt release of such Portfolio Railcar.           (d) Maintenance of Assets. The Issuer will, with respect to each Portfolio Railcar under Lease, cause, directly or indirectly, such Portfolio Railcar to be maintained in a state of repair and condition consistent with the reasonable commercial practice of leading railcar operating lessors with respect to similar railcars under lease, taking into consideration, among other things, the identity of the relevant Lessee (including the credit standing and operating experience thereof), the age and condition of the Portfolio Railcar and the jurisdiction in which the Portfolio Railcar is or will be operated or in which the Lessee is based. In addition, the Issuer will, with respect to each Portfolio Railcar that is not subject to a Lease, maintain such Portfolio Railcar in a state of repair and condition consistent with the reasonable commercial practice of leading railcar operating lessors with respect to railcars not under lease.           (e) Notification of Loss, Theft, Damage or Destruction. The Issuer will notify the Indenture Trustee, the Administrator, and the Manager, in writing, as soon as the Issuer becomes aware of any loss, theft, damage or destruction to any Portfolio Railcar if the potential cost of repair or replacement of such asset (without regard to any insurance claim related thereto) may exceed $1,000,000.           (f) Insurance. The Issuer covenants with the Indenture Trustee as follows:           (i) Insurance. The Issuer will at all times after the Closing Date, at its own expense, keep or cause the Insurance Manager under the Insurance Agreement to keep each Portfolio Railcar insured with insurers of recognized responsibility with a rating of at least A- by AxxPDMxxPD Best Company (or a comparable rating by a nationally or internationally recognized rating group of comparable stature) or by other insurers approved in writing by the Requisite Majority, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, in amounts and against risks and with deductibles and terms and conditions not less beneficial to the insured thereunder than the insurance, if any, maintained by the Manager with respect to similar equipment which it owns or leases, but in no event shall such coverage be for amounts or against risks less than the Prudent Industry Practice.           (ii) Additional Insurance. In the event that the Issuer shall fail to maintain insurance as herein provided, the Indenture Trustee may at its option, upon prior written notice to the Issuer, provide such insurance and, in such event, the Issuer shall,



 upon demand from time to time reimburse the Indenture Trustee for the cost thereof together with interest from the date of payment thereof at the Stated Rate on the Equipment Notes, on the amount of the cost to the Indenture Trustee of such insurance which the Issuer shall have failed to maintain. If after the Indenture Trustee has provided such insurance, the Issuer then obtains the coverage provided for in Section 5.04(f) which was replaced by the insurance provided by the Indenture Trustee, and the Issuer provides the Indenture Trustee with evidence of such coverage reasonably satisfactory to the Indenture Trustee, the Indenture Trustee shall cancel the insurance it has provided pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 5.04(f)(ii). In such event, the Issuer shall reimburse the Indenture Trustee for all costs to the Indenture Trustee of cancellation, including without limitation any short rate penalty, together with interest from the date of the Indenture Trustee's payment thereof at the Stated Rate on the Equipment Notes. In addition, at any time the Indenture Trustee may at its own expense carry insurance with respect to its interest in the Portfolio Railcars, provided that such insurance does not interfere with the Issuer's ability to insure the Portfolio Railcars as required by this Section 5.04(f) or adversely affect the Issuer's insurance or the cost thereof, it being understood that all salvage rights to each Portfolio Railcar shall remain with the Issuer's insurers at all times. Any insurance payments received from policies maintained by the Indenture Trustee pursuant to the previous sentence shall be retained by the applicable Person obtaining such insurance without reducing or otherwise affecting the Issuer's obligations hereunder, other than with respect to Portfolio Railcars) with respect to which such payments have been made.           (g) No Accounts. Except as contemplated herein, the Issuer will not have an interest in any deposit account or securities account (other than the Indenture Accounts and other than any account which may be required to be established as a necessary consequence of or in order to invest in or otherwise acquire a Permitted Investment) unless (i) any such further account and the Issuer's interest therein shall be further charged or otherwise secured in favor of the Indenture Trustee for the benefit of the Secured Parties and (ii) any such further account is held in the custody of and under the "control" (as such term is defined in the UCC) of the Indenture Trustee.           (h) Notices. If at any time any creditor of the Issuer seeks to enforce any judgment or order of any competent court or other competent tribunal against any of the Collateral, the Issuer shall (i) promptly give written notice to such creditor and to such court or tribunal of the Indenture Trustee's interests in the Collateral, (ii) if at any time an examiner, administrator, administrative receiver, receiver, trustee, custodian, sequestrator, conservator or other similar appointee (an " Insolvency Appointee ") is appointed in respect of any secured creditor or any of their assets, promptly give notice to such appointee of the Indenture Trustee's interests in the Collateral and (iii) notify the Indenture Trustee thereof in either case of clauses (i) and (ii) above. The Issuer will not voluntarily appoint or cause to be appointed or commence any proceeding to appoint any Insolvency Appointee over all or any of its property.           (i) Compliance with Agreements. The Issuer will comply with and perform all its obligations under the Indenture, the Issuer Documents and the other Operative Agreements to which the Issuer is a party.

The Issuer shall deliver (or cause to be delivered) to the Indenture Trustee file-stamped copies of, or filing receipts for, any document filed as provided above, following such filing in accordance herewith. In the event that the Issuer fails to perform its obligations under this subsection, the Indenture Trustee may perform such obligations, at the expense of the Issuer, and the Issuer hereby authorizes the Indenture Trustee and grants to such persons an irrevocable power of attorney to take any and all steps in order to perform such obligations in the Issuer's own name and on behalf of the Issuer, as are necessary or desirable, in the determination of the Indenture Trustee, as applicable.           (l) Stamping of the Leases.

 ARTICLE XI SUBORDINATION      Section 11.01 Subordination.           (a) Each Noteholder and Service Provider agrees that its claims against the Issuer for payment of amounts are subordinate to any claims ranking in priority thereto as set forth in the Flow of Funds hereof, including any post-petition interest (each such prior claim, a " Senior Claim "), which subordination shall continue until the holder of such Senior Claim (a " Senior Claimant "), or the Indenture Trustee on its behalf, has received the full cash amount of such Senior Claim. Each such Person is also obligated to hold for the benefit of the Senior Claimant any amounts received by such Person which, under the terms of this Indenture, should have been paid to or on behalf of the Senior Claimant and to pay over such amounts to the Indenture Trustee for application as provided in the Flow of Funds.           (b) If any Senior Claimant receives any payment in respect of any Senior Claim which is subsequently invalidated, declared preferential, set aside and/or required to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or other party, then, to the extent such payment is so invalidated, declared preferential, set aside and/or required to be repaid, such Senior Claim shall be revived and continue in full force and effect, and shall be entitled to the benefits of this Article XI, all as if such payment had not been received.           (c) Each Noteholder, by its acceptance of an Equipment Note, and each other payee pursuant to the Flow of Funds, by entering into the Operative Agreement to which it is a party, authorizes and expressly directs the Indenture Trustee on its behalf to take such action as may be necessary or appropriate to effectuate the subordination provided in this Article XI, and appoints the Indenture Trustee its attorney-in-fact for such purposes, including, in the event of any dissolution, winding up, liquidation or reorganization of the Issuer (whether in bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership, reorganization or similar proceedings or upon an assignment for the benefit of creditors or otherwise) any actions tending towards liquidation of the property and assets of the Issuer or the filing of a claim for the unpaid balance of its Equipment Notes in the form required in those proceedings.           (d) No right of any holder of any Senior Claim to enforce the subordination of any subordinated claim shall be impaired by an act or failure to act by the Issuer or the Indenture Trustee or by any failure by either the Issuer or the Indenture Trustee to comply with this Indenture, unless such failure shall materially prejudice the rights of the subordinated claimant.           (e) Each Noteholder, by accepting an Equipment Note, and each other payee pursuant to the Flow of Funds, by entering into the Operative Agreement to which it is a party, acknowledges and agrees that the foregoing subordination provisions are, and are intended to be, an inducement and a consideration to each holder of any Senior Claim, whether such Senior Claim was created or acquired before or after the issuance of such holder's claim, to acquire and continue to hold such Senior Claim and such holder of any Senior Claim shall be deemed conclusively to have relied on such subordination provisions in acquiring and continuing to hold such Senior Claim.



           (f) The Noteholders of the Equipment Notes shall have the right to receive, to the extent necessary to make the required payments with respect to the Equipment Notes at the times set forth herein, (i) the portion of Collections allocable to Noteholders of the Equipment Notes pursuant to this Indenture and (ii) funds on deposit in the Liquidity Reserve Account allocated in accordance with the terms of this Indenture.

With respect to each Collection Period, Collections on deposit in the Collections Account will be allocated to the Equipment Notes then Outstanding in accordance with the Flow of Funds. ARTICLE XII DISCHARGE OF INDENTURE; DEFEASANCE      Section 12.01 Discharge of Liability on the Equipment Notes; Defeasance.           (a) When (i) the Issuer delivers to the Indenture Trustee all Outstanding Equipment Notes (other than Equipment Notes replaced pursuant to Section 2.08 hereof) for cancellation or (ii) all Outstanding Equipment Notes have become due and payable, whether at maturity or as a result of the mailing of a Redemption Notice pursuant to Section 3.13(a) hereof and the Issuer irrevocably deposits in the Redemption/Defeasance Account funds sufficient to pay at maturity, or upon Redemption of, all Outstanding Equipment Notes, including interest thereon to maturity or the Redemption Date (other than Equipment Notes replaced pursuant to Section 2.08), and if in either case the Issuer pays all other sums payable hereunder by the Issuer including any premium, then this Indenture shall, subject to Section 12.01(c), cease to be of further effect. The Indenture Trustee shall acknowledge satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture on demand of the Issuer accompanied by an Officers' Certificate and an opinion of counsel, at the cost and expense of the Issuer, to the effect that any conditions precedent to a discharge of this Indenture have been met.           (b) Subject to Sections 12.01(c) and 12.02, the Issuer at any time may terminate (i) all its obligations under the Equipment Notes and this Indenture (the "legal defeasance" option) or (ii) its obligations under Sections 5.02, 5.03, 5.04 and 4.01 (other than with respect to a failure to comply with Sections 4.01(a), 4.01(b), 4.01(e) (only with respect to the Issuer) and 4.01(f) (only with respect to the Issuer)) (the "covenant defeasance" option). The Issuer may exercise its legal defeasance option notwithstanding its prior exercise of its covenant defeasance option.      If the Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option, payment of any Equipment Notes subject to such legal defeasance may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default.

Such unclaimed funds shall remain uninvested and in no event shall the Indenture Trustee be liable for interest on such unclaimed funds.      Section 12.05 Indemnity for Government Obligations and Corporate Obligations.      The Issuer shall pay and shall indemnify the Indenture Trustee against any tax, fee or other charge imposed on or assessed against deposited UxxPDSxxPD Government Obligations or Corporate Obligations, or the principal and interest received on such UxxPDSxxPD Government Obligations or Corporate Obligations.      Section 12.06 Reinstatement.      If the Indenture Trustee is unable to apply any money or UxxPDSxxPD Government Obligations or Corporate Obligations in accordance with this Article XII by reason of any legal proceeding or



 by reason of any order or judgment of any court or governmental authority enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting such application, the Issuer's obligations under this Indenture and the Equipment Notes shall be revived and reinstated as though no deposit had occurred pursuant to this Article XII until such time as the Indenture Trustee is permitted to apply all such money, UxxPDSxxPD Government Obligations or Corporate Obligations in accordance with this Article XII;  provided, however,  that, if the Issuer has made any payment of interest on or principal of any Equipment Notes because of the reinstatement of its obligations, the Issuer shall be subrogated to the rights of the Holders of such Equipment Notes to receive such payment from the money, UxxPDSxxPD Government Obligations or Corporate Obligations held by the Indenture Trustee. ARTICLE XIII MISCELLANEOUS      Section 13.01 Right of Indenture Trustee to Perform.      If the Issuer for any reason fails to observe or punctually to perform any of its obligations to the Indenture Trustee, whether under this Indenture or any of the other Operative Agreements or otherwise, the Indenture Trustee shall have power (but shall have no obligation), on behalf of or in the name of the Issuer or otherwise, to perform such obligations and to take any steps which the Indenture Trustee may, in its absolute discretion, consider appropriate with a view to remedying, or mitigating the consequences of, such failure by the Issuer;  provided  that no exercise or failure to exercise this power by the Indenture Trustee shall in any way prejudice the Indenture Trustee's other rights under this Indenture or any of the other Operative Agreements.      Section 13.02 Waiver.      Any waiver by any party of any provision of this Indenture or any right, remedy or option hereunder shall only prevent and estop such party from thereafter enforcing such provision, right, remedy or option if such waiver is given in writing and only as to the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which such waiver was given. The failure or refusal of any party hereto to insist in any one or more instances, or in a course of dealing, upon the strict performance of any of the terms or provisions of this Indenture by any party hereto or the partial exercise of any right, remedy or option hereunder shall not be construed as a waiver or relinquishment of any such term or provision, but the same shall continue in full force and effect. No failure on the part of the Indenture Trustee to exercise, and no delay on its part in exercising, any right or remedy under this Indenture will operate as a waiver thereof, nor will any single or partial exercise of any right or remedy preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or remedy. The rights and remedies provided in this Indenture are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by law.      Section 13.03 Severability.      In the event that any provision of this Indenture or the application thereof to any party hereto or to any circumstance or in any jurisdiction governing this Indenture shall, to any extent, be invalid or unenforceable under any applicable statute, regulation or rule of law, then such



 provision shall be deemed inoperative to the extent that it is invalid or unenforceable and the remainder of this Indenture, and the application of any such invalid or unenforceable provision to the parties, jurisdictions or circumstances other than to whom or to which it is held invalid or unenforceable, shall not be affected thereby nor shall the same affect the validity or enforceability of this Indenture. The parties hereto further agree that the holding by any court of competent jurisdiction that any remedy pursued by the Indenture Trustee hereunder is unavailable or unenforceable shall not affect in any way the ability of the Indenture Trustee to pursue any other remedy available to it.      Section 13.04 Notices.      All notices, demands, certificates, requests, directions, instructions and communications hereunder ("Notices") shall be in writing and shall be effective (a) upon receipt when sent through the mails, registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, with such receipt to be effective the date of delivery indicated on the return receipt, or (b) one Business Day after delivery to an overnight courier, or (c) on the date personally delivered to an authorized officer of the party to which sent, or (d) on the date transmitted by legible telecopier transmission with a confirmation of receipt, in all cases addressed to the recipient as follows:      if to the Issuer, to: Trinity Rail Leasing VII LLC  2525 Stemmons Freeway  Dallas, TX 75207      with copies to: Kaye Scholer LLC  3 First National Plaza, Suite 4100  70 West Madison Street  Chicago, IL 60602  Attention: William Fellerhoff, Esq.  Facsimile: (312) 583-2360      if to the Administrator, to: Trinity Industries Leasing Company  2525 Stemmons Freeway  Dallas, TX 75207  Attention: Vice President, Leasing Operations

If not otherwise required to be applied in the Received Currency, the Administrator or the Manager, as the case may be, acting on behalf of the Security Trustee, shall promptly convert any moneys in such Received Currency other than Dollars into Dollars.
