All Series 2015A Notes need not be issued at the same time and such series may be reopened at any time, without the consent of any Holder, for issuances of additional Series 2015A Notes. Any such additional Series 2015A Notes will have the same interest rate, maturity and other terms as those initially issued (except for the public offering price and Original Issue Date and the initial interest accrual date and initial Interest Payment Date, if applicable). No Series 2015A Notes shall be authenticated and delivered in excess of the principal amount as so increased except as provided by Sections 203, 303, 304, 907 or 1107 of the Original Indenture. The Series 2015A Notes shall be issued in definitive fully registered form. The Series 2015A Notes shall be issued in the form of one or more Global Securities in substantially the form set out in Exhibit A hereto. The Depositary with respect to the Series 2015A Notes shall be The Depository Trust Company. The form of the Trustee's Certificate of Authentication for the Series 2015A Notes shall be in substantially the form set forth in Exhibit B hereto. Each Series 2015A Note shall be dated the date of authentication thereof and shall bear interest from the date of original issuance thereof or from the most recent Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for. SECTION 102. Definitions. The following defined terms used herein shall, unless the context otherwise requires, have the meanings specified below. Capitalized terms used herein for which no definition is provided herein shall have the meanings set forth in the Original Indenture. "Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security selected by an Independent Investment Banker as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Series 2015A Notes to be redeemed that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of the Series 2015A Notes. "Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to any Redemption Date (i) the average of the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such Redemption Date, after excluding the highest and lowest such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or (ii) if the Company obtains fewer than four such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all such quotations. "Independent Investment Banker" means an independent investment banking institution of national standing appointed by the Company. "Interest Payment Dates" means March 1 and September 1 of each year, commencing September 1, 2015. "Original Issue Date" means March 11, 2015. "Reference Treasury Dealer" means a primary UxxPDSxxPD Government securities dealer in the United States appointed by the Company. "Reference Treasury Dealer Quotation" means, with respect to a Reference Treasury Dealer and any Redemption Date, the average, as determined by the Company, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount and quoted in writing to the Company by such Reference Treasury Dealer at 5:00 pxxPDmxxPD on the third Business Day in New York City preceding such Redemption Date). "Regular Record Date" means, with respect to each Interest Payment Date, the close of business on the 15th calendar day preceding such Interest Payment Date (whether or not a Business Day). "Stated Maturity" means March 1, 2045. "Treasury Yield" means, with respect to any Redemption Date, the rate per annum equal to the semi-annual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue, assuming a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such Redemption Date. SECTION 103. Payment of Principal and Interest. The principal of the Series 2015A Notes shall be due at Stated Maturity (unless earlier redeemed). The unpaid principal amount of the Series 2015A Notes shall bear interest at the rate of 3.750% per annum until paid or duly provided for. Interest shall be paid semiannually in arrears on each Interest Payment Date to the Person in whose name the Series 2015A Notes are registered on the Regular Record Date for such Interest Payment Date, provided that interest payable at the Stated Maturity or on a Redemption Date as provided herein will be paid to the Person to whom principal is payable. Any such interest that is not so punctually paid or duly provided for will forthwith cease to be payable to the Holders on such Regular Record Date and may either be paid to the Person or Persons in whose name the Series 2015A Notes are registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such defaulted interest to be fixed by the Trustee, notice whereof shall be given to Holders of the Series 2015A Notes not less than ten (10) days prior to such Special Record Date, or be paid at any time in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange, if any, on which the Series 2015A Notes shall be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by any such exchange, all as more fully provided in the Original Indenture. Payments of interest on the Series 2015A Notes will include interest accrued to but excluding the respective Interest Payment Dates.

The principal of and interest on the Series 2015A Notes shall be paid in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts. Payments of interest (including interest on any Interest Payment Date) will be made, subject to such surrender where applicable, at the option of the Company, (i) by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto as such address shall appear in the Security Register or (ii) by wire transfer or other electronic transfer at such place and to such account at a banking institution in the United States as may be designated in writing to the Trustee at least sixteen (16) days prior to the date for payment by the Person entitled thereto. SECTION 104.

The Global Securities described above may not be transferred except by the Depositary to a nominee of the Depositary or by a nominee of the Depositary to the Depositary or another nominee of the Depositary or to a successor Depositary or its nominee. Owners of beneficial interests in such a Global Security will not be considered the Holders thereof for any purpose under the Indenture, and no Global Security representing a Series 2015A Note shall be exchangeable, except for another Global Security of like denomination and tenor to be registered in the name of the Depositary or its nominee or a successor Depositary or its nominee. The rights of Holders of such Global Security shall be exercised only through the Depositary. Neither the Company, the Trustee, nor any agent of the Company or the Trustee shall have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests in a Global Security or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to such beneficial ownership interests. Subject to the procedures of the Depositary, a Global Security shall be exchangeable for Series 2015A Notes registered in the names of persons other than the Depositary or its nominee only if (i) the Depositary notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as a Depositary for such Global Security and no successor Depositary shall have been appointed by the Company, or if at any time the Depositary ceases to be a clearing agency registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, at a time when the Depositary is required to be so registered to act as such Depositary and no successor Depositary shall have been appointed by the Company, in each case within 90 days after the Company receives such notice or becomes aware of such cessation, (ii) the Company in its sole discretion determines that such Global Security shall be so exchangeable, or (iii) there shall have occurred an Event of Default with respect to the Series 2015A Notes. Any Global Security that is exchangeable pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be exchangeable for Series 2015A Notes registered in such names as the Depositary shall direct. SECTION 106. Transfer. No service charge will be made for any transfer or exchange of Series 2015A Notes, but payment will be required of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection therewith. The Company shall not be required (a) to issue, register the transfer of or exchange any Series 2015A Notes during a period beginning at the opening of business fifteen (15) days before the date of the mailing of a notice pursuant to Section 1104 of the Original Indenture identifying the serial numbers of the Series 2015A Notes to be called for redemption, and ending at the close of business on the day of the mailing, or (b) to register the transfer of or exchange any Series 2015A Notes theretofore selected for redemption in whole or in part, except the unredeemed portion of any Series 2015A Notes redeemed in part. SECTION 107. Redemption at the Company's Option. At any time and from time to time prior to September 1, 2044, the Series 2015A Notes will be subject to redemption at the option of the Company in whole or in part upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' notice, at Redemption Prices equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of the Series 2015A Notes being redeemed and (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal of and interest on the Series 2015A Notes being redeemed (not including any portion of such payments of interest accrued to the Redemption Date), discounted (for purposes of determining present value) to the Redemption Date on a semiannual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at a discount rate equal to the Treasury Yield plus 20 basis points, plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the Redemption Date. At any time and from time to time on or after September 1, 2044, the Series 2015A Notes will be subject to redemption at the option of the Company in whole or in part upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' notice, at a Redemption Price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Series 2015A Notes being redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the Redemption Date. In the event of redemption of the Series 2015A Notes in part only, a new Series 2015A Note or Notes for the unredeemed portion will be issued in the name or names of the Holders thereof upon the surrender thereof. The Series 2015A Notes will not have a sinking fund. Notice of redemption shall be given as provided in Section 1104 of the Original Indenture, except that any notice of redemption with respect to any redemption occurring prior to September 1, 2044 shall not specify the Redemption Price therefor but only the manner of calculation thereof. The Trustee shall not be responsible for the calculation of such Redemption Price. The Company shall calculate such Redemption Price and promptly notify the Trustee thereof. Any redemption of less than all of the Series 2015A Notes shall, with respect to the principal thereof, be divisible by $1,000. ARTICLE 2 Miscellaneous Provisions SECTION 201.
