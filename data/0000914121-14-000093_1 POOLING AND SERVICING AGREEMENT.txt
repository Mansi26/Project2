 "Workout Fee":  An amount equal to the lesser of (1) 1.0% of each collection of interest and principal (including scheduled payments, prepayments (provided that a repurchase or substitution by a Mortgage Loan Seller of a Mortgage Loan due to a Material Defect or a Material Breach shall not be considered a prepayment for purposes of this definition), Balloon Payments and payments at maturity, but excluding late payment charges, Default Interest and Excess Interest) received on a Specially Serviced Loan that becomes a Corrected Mortgage Loan for so long as it remains a Corrected Mortgage Loan, pursuant to Section 3.12(c) of this Agreement and (2) $1,000,000, in the aggregate with respect to any particular workout of a Specially Serviced Loan; provided that the Workout Fee with respect to any Corrected Mortgage Loan shall be capped in accordance with Section 3.12(c) of this Agreement; provided, further that no Workout Fee shall be payable by the Trust with respect to any Corrected Mortgage Loan if and to the extent that the Corrected Mortgage Loan became a Specially Serviced Loan under clause (c) of the definition of "Specially Serviced Loan" (and no other clause of such definition) and no event of default actually occurs, unless the Mortgage Loan or Serviced Companion Loan is modified by the Special Servicer in accordance with the terms of this Agreement; provided, further that if a Mortgage Loan or Serviced Companion Loan becomes a Specially Serviced Loan only because of an event described in clause (a) of the definition of "Specially Serviced Loan" and the related collection of principal and interest is received within 3 months following the related maturity date as a result of the related Mortgage Loan or Serviced Companion Loan being refinanced or otherwise repaid in full, the Special Servicer shall not be entitled to collect a Workout Fee out of the proceeds received in connection with such workout if such fee would reduce the amount available for distributions to Certificateholders, but the Special Servicer may collect from the related Borrower and retain (x) a workout fee, (y) such other fees as are provided for in the related Loan Documents and (z) other appropriate fees in connection with such workout.  The total amount of Workout Fees payable by the Trust with respect to any Corrected Mortgage Loan and with respect to any particular workout (assuming, for the purposes of this calculation, that such Corrected Mortgage Loan continues to perform throughout its term in accordance with the terms of the related workout) shall be reduced by the amount of any and all related Offsetting Modification Fees received by the Special Servicer as additional servicing compensation relating to such Corrected Mortgage Loan; provided that the Special Servicer shall be entitled to collect such Workout Fees from the Trust until such time it has been fully paid such reduced amount.  For the avoidance of doubt, the Mortgage Loan Seller will be required to pay a Workout Fee in connection with a repurchase or substitution to the extent the Special Servicer was entitled to such a fee and such fee was unpaid immediately prior to such repurchase or substitution or was previously paid by the Trust and was not reimbursed by the related Borrower immediately prior to such repurchase or substitution.  In furtherance of the foregoing, upon a Specially Serviced Loan becoming a Corrected Mortgage Loan, the Special Servicer shall provide the Master Servicer with a calculation of the total amount of Workout Fees expected to be payable by the Trust with respect to such Corrected Mortgage Loan throughout its term (which calculation shall be reasonably acceptable to the Master Servicer) and the total amount of related Offsetting Modification Fees received by the Special Servicer.

All calculations of interest with respect to the Actual/360 Mortgage Loans and of Advances provided in respect thereof provided for herein shall be made as set forth in the Loan Documents for such Mortgage Loans and, if applicable, Serviced Companion Loans, with respect to the calculation of the related Mortgage Rate.

 (b)           Any Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination payment is deemed to be received on the date such payment is actually received by the Master Servicer or the Certificate Administrator; provided, that for purposes of calculating distributions on the Certificates, Principal Prepayments with respect to any Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination are deemed to be received on the date they are applied in accordance with Section 3.01(b) of this Agreement to reduce the Stated Principal Balance of such Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination on which interest accrues.



 (c)           Except as otherwise provided in the related Loan Documents or Intercreditor Agreement, any amounts received in respect of a Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination as to which a default has occurred and is continuing in excess of Monthly Payments shall be applied to Default Interest and other amounts due on such Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination prior to the application to late fees.

 (xxi)        with respect to any Mortgage Loan with related mezzanine debt or other subordinate debt (other than a Companion Loan), a co-lender agreement, the related subordination agreement or other intercreditor agreement.



 With respect to Serviced Loan Combinations, except for the Note referred to in clause (i)(B) of the preceding paragraph, only a single original set of the Loan Documents specified above is required to be delivered.  With respect to a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan, the preceding document delivery requirements will be met by the delivery by the applicable Mortgage Loan Seller to the Custodian of copies of the documents specified above (other than the Note and intervening endorsements evidencing a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan, with respect







 to which the originals shall be required), including a copy of the Mortgage securing the applicable Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan and copies of the companion notes.



 With respect to the Mortgage Loans, within 45 days after the Closing Date or, without limiting the requirements of the second paragraph of Section 2.01(b), after such later date on which the Mortgage Loan Seller has all the missing recording/filing information, each Mortgage Loan Seller will, or will at the expense of such Mortgage Loan Seller retain a third party vendor to, (1) complete (to the extent necessary) and submit for recording in favor of the Trustee in the following form: "UxxPDSxxPD Bank National Association, as Trustee, for the benefit of the Holders of COMM 2013-CCRE12 Mortgage Trust Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates" (and with respect to a Serviced Loan Combination, the related Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders) in the appropriate public recording office (a) each Assignment of Mortgage referred to in Section 2.01(a)(iii) which has not yet been submitted for recording and (b) each Reassignment of Assignment of Leases, Rents and Profits referred to in Section 2.01(a)(viii)(B) (if not otherwise included in the related Assignment of Mortgage) which has not yet been submitted for recordation; and (2) complete (to the extent necessary) and file in the appropriate public filing office each UCC assignment of financing statement referred to in Section 2.01(a)(v)(B) and (xiii) which has not yet been submitted for filing or recording.  Each such document shall reflect that the recorded original should be returned by the public recording office to the Custodian or its designee (or to the Mortgage Loan Seller or its designee as an alternative) following recording, and each such document shall reflect that the file copy thereof should be returned to the Custodian or its designee (or to the Mortgage Loan Seller or its designee as an alternative) following filing; provided that in those instances where the public recording office retains the original Assignment of Mortgage or Reassignment of Assignment of Leases, Rents and Profits, the Custodian shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain therefrom a certified copy of the recorded original, at the expense of the Depositor.  In the event that any such document or instrument in respect of any Mortgage Loan is lost or returned unrecorded or unfiled, as the case may be, because of a defect therein, the related Mortgage Loan Seller shall promptly prepare or cause the preparation of a substitute thereof or cure or cause the curing of such defect, as the case may be, and shall thereafter deliver the substitute or corrected document to or at the direction of the Custodian or such other third party vendor as retained by the Mortgage Loan Seller for recording or filing, as appropriate, at such Mortgage Loan Seller's expense (as set forth in the related Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement).  In the event that any Mortgage Loan Seller receives the original recorded or filed copy, each Mortgage Loan Seller will, promptly upon receipt of the original recorded or filed copy (and in no event later than five Business Days following such receipt) deliver such original to the Custodian, with evidence of filing or recording thereon.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 2.01, in those instances where the public recording office retains the original Mortgage, Assignment of Mortgage, Assignment of Leases, Rents and Profits or Reassignment of Assignment of Leases, Rents and Profits, if applicable, after any has been recorded, the obligations of the related Mortgage Loan Seller under the applicable Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement shall be deemed to have been satisfied upon delivery to the Custodian of a copy of the recorded original of such Mortgage, Assignment of Mortgage, Assignment of Leases, Rents and Profits or Reassignment of Assignment of Leases, Rents and Profits, if applicable.



 If a Mortgage Loan Seller cannot deliver, or cause to be delivered, as to any Mortgage Loan, the original or a copy of the related lender's title insurance policy referred to in







 Section 2.01(a)(vii) solely because such policy has not yet been issued, the delivery requirements of this Section 2.01 will be deemed to be satisfied as to such missing item, and such missing item will be deemed to have been included in the related Mortgage File by delivery to the Custodian of a binder marked as binding and countersigned by the title insurer or its authorized agent (which may be a pro forma or specimen title insurance policy which has been accepted or approved as binding in writing by the related title insurance company) or an acknowledged closing instruction or escrow letter, and the Mortgage Loan Seller will be required to deliver to the Custodian, promptly following the receipt thereof, the original related lender's title insurance policy (or a copy thereof).  Copies of recorded or filed Assignments of Mortgage, Reassignments of Assignment of Leases, Rents and Profits and UCC assignments of financing statements shall be held by the Custodian.



 Subject to the third preceding paragraph, all original documents relating to the Mortgage Loans which are not delivered to the Custodian are and shall be held by the Depositor or the Master Servicer (or a sub-servicer on its behalf), as the case may be, in trust for the benefit of the Certificateholders and, insofar as they also relate to the Serviced Companion Loans, on behalf of and for the benefit of the related Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders.  In the event that any such original document, or in the case of a Serviced Companion Loan, the original Note, is required pursuant to the terms of this Section to be a part of a Mortgage File in order to effectuate the purposes of this Agreement, such document shall be delivered promptly to the Custodian.



 (b)           In connection with the Depositor's assignment pursuant to subsection (a) above, the Depositor shall direct, and hereby represents and warrants that it has directed, each of the Mortgage Loan Sellers pursuant to the applicable Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement to deliver to and deposit with or cause to be delivered to and deposited with, (i) the Custodian, on or before the Closing Date, for each Mortgage Loan so assigned the Note (or a copy of the Note evidencing each related Serviced Companion Loan), the original or a copy of the related Mortgage, the original or a copy of the title policy for each Mortgage Loan, subject to the second-to-last paragraph under Section 2.01(a), a copy of the related ground lease, if applicable, for each Mortgage Loan and an original (or copy, if the original is held by the Master Servicer pursuant to Section 2.01(c)) of any letters of credit held by the lender as beneficiary or assigned as security for the Mortgage Loan, and, except as otherwise provided in the following paragraph, within 30 days following the Closing Date, the remaining applicable documents referred to in Section 2.01(a) for each such Mortgage Loan or Serviced Companion Loan, in each case with copies to the Master Servicer and (ii) the Master Servicer, on or before the Closing Date, all documents and records that are part of each applicable Servicing File.  If the applicable Mortgage Loan Seller cannot deliver, or cause to be delivered, as to any Mortgage Loan, the original Note, such Mortgage Loan Seller shall deliver a copy or duplicate original of such Note, together with an affidavit certifying that the original thereof has been lost or destroyed and an indemnification in favor of the Certificate Administrator, the Trustee and the Custodian.



 If the applicable Mortgage Loan Seller or the Depositor cannot deliver, or cause to be delivered, as to any Mortgage Loan, the original or a copy of any of the documents and/or instruments referred to in Section 2.01(a)(ii), Section 2.01(a)(iii), Section 2.01(a)(v), Section 2.01(a)(viii), Section 2.01(a)(xiv) and Section 2.01(a)(xvi) and the UCC financing statements and UCC assignments of financing statements referred to in Section 2.01(a)(xiii),







 with evidence of recording or filing thereon, solely because of a delay caused by the public recording or filing office where such document or instrument has been delivered for recordation or filing, or because such original recorded or filed document has been lost or returned from the recording or filing office and subsequently lost, as the case may be, the delivery requirements of Section 2.01 shall be deemed to have been satisfied as to such missing item, and such missing item shall be deemed to have been included in the related Mortgage File, provided that a copy of such document or instrument (without evidence of recording or filing thereon, but certified (which certificate may relate to multiple documents and/or instruments) by the applicable public recording or filing office, the applicable title insurance company or the related Mortgage Loan Seller to be a true and complete copy of the original thereof submitted for recording or filing, as the case may be) has been delivered to the Custodian within 45 days after the Closing Date, and either the original of such missing document or instrument, or a copy thereof, with evidence of recording or filing, as the case may be, thereon, is delivered to the Custodian within 180 days after the Closing Date (or within such longer period after the Closing Date so long as the related Mortgage Loan Seller has provided the Custodian with evidence of such recording or filing, as the case may be, or has certified to the Custodian as to the occurrence of such recording or filing, as the case may be, and is, as certified to the Custodian no less often than quarterly, in good faith attempting to obtain from the appropriate county recorder's or filing office such original or copy, provided such extensions do not exceed 24 months in the aggregate).



 (c)           Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, with respect to the documents referred to in Section 2.01(a)(xix) and Section 2.01(a)(xx) of this Agreement, the Master Servicer shall hold (or the applicable Other Servicer with respect to any Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan will hold) the original of each such document in trust on behalf of the Trust in order to draw on such letter of credit on behalf of the Trust and the applicable Mortgage Loan Seller shall be deemed to have satisfied the delivery requirements of the related Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement and this Section 2.01 of this Agreement by delivering the original of each such document to the Master Servicer, who shall forward a copy of the applicable document to the Custodian.  The applicable Mortgage Loan Seller shall pay any costs of assignment or amendment of such letter of credit (which amendment shall change the beneficiary of the letter of credit to the Trust in care of the Master Servicer) required in order for the Master Servicer to draw on such letter of credit on behalf of the Trust.  In the event that the documents specified in Section 2.01(a)(xx) of this Agreement are missing because the related assignment or amendment documents have not been completed, the applicable Mortgage Loan Seller shall take all necessary steps to enable the Master Servicer to draw on the related letter of credit on behalf of the Trust including, if necessary, drawing on the letter of credit in its own name pursuant to written instructions from the Master Servicer and immediately remitting such funds (or causing such funds to be remitted) to the Master Servicer.



 (d)           With respect to the Mortgage Loans secured by the Mortgaged Properties identified as Loan Nos. 9, 14, 21, 30, 31, 38, 39, 42, 53 on the Mortgage Loan Schedule, which are each subject to a franchise agreement with a related comfort letter in favor of the respective Mortgage Loan Seller that requires notice to or request of the related franchisor to transfer or assign any related comfort letter to the Trust or otherwise have a new comfort letter issued in the name of the Trust, the related Mortgage Loan Seller or its designee will be required to provide any such required notice or make any such required request to the related franchisor within 45 days of the Closing Date (or any shorter period if required by the applicable comfort letter)







 notify the related franchisor that the Mortgage Loans have been transferred to the Trust and request a replacement comfort letter (or any such new document or acknowledgement as may be contemplated under the existing comfort letter), and the Master Servicer shall use reasonable efforts in accordance with the Servicing Standard to acquire such replacement comfort letter, if necessary (or to acquire any such new document or acknowledgement as may be contemplated under the existing comfort letter).



 Section 2.02     Acceptance by Custodian and the Trustee.  By its execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Trustee acknowledges the assignment to it of the Mortgage Loans in good faith without notice of adverse claims and declares that the Custodian holds and will hold such documents and all others delivered to it constituting the Mortgage File (to the extent the documents constituting the Mortgage File are actually delivered to the Custodian) for any Mortgage Loan assigned to the Trustee hereunder in trust, upon the conditions herein set forth, for the use and benefit of all present and future Certificateholders and Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders.



 The Custodian hereby certifies to each of the Directing Holder, the Depositor, the Certificate Administrator, the Trustee, the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer and each Mortgage Loan Seller that except as identified in the Custodian's closing date certification, which shall be delivered no later than two Business Days after the Closing Date substantially in the form attached as Exhibit N-1 to this Agreement, (i) each Note (or copy thereof, with respect to any Serviced Companion Loan) is in its possession and has been reviewed by the Custodian and (A) appears regular on its face (handwritten additions, changes or corrections shall not constitute irregularities if initialed by the Borrower), (B) appears to have been executed (where appropriate) and (C) purports to relate to such Mortgage Loan and (ii) each of the documents specified in Section 2.01(a)(ii), Section 2.01(a)(vii), Section 2.01(a)(xi) and Section 2.01(a)(xix) of this Agreement have been received, have been executed, appear to be what they purport to be, purport to be recorded or filed (as applicable) and have not been torn in any materially adverse manner or mutilated or otherwise defaced, and that such documents relate to the Mortgage Loans identified in the Mortgage Loan Schedule.



 On or about the 60th day following the Closing Date (and, if any exceptions are noted, again on or about the 90th day following the Closing Date and monthly thereafter until the earliest of (i) the second anniversary of the Closing Date, (ii) the day on which all material exceptions have been removed and (iii) the day on which the applicable Mortgage Loan Seller has repurchased or substituted for the last affected Mortgage Loan), the Custodian shall review each Mortgage File and shall certify to each of the Controlling Class Representative, the Depositor, the Certificate Administrator, the Trustee, the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Operating Advisor and each Mortgage Loan Seller in the form attached as Exhibit N-2 to this Agreement that all documents (other than documents referred to in clauses (xix) and (xx) of Section 2.01(a) of this Agreement, which shall be delivered to the Master Servicer and the documents referred to in clauses (iii), (v)(B) and (viii)(B) of Section 2.01(a) of this Agreement and the assignments of financing statements referred to in clause (xiii) of Section 2.01(a) of this Agreement, which shall be delivered for filing or recording by the related Mortgage Loan Seller as provided herein) referred to in Section 2.01(a) above (in the case of the documents referred to in Section 2.01(a)(iv), (vi), (viii), (ix), (x), (xii) through (xvi) and (xviii) through (xx) of this Agreement, as identified to it in writing by the related Mortgage Loan Seller) and any original







  recorded documents included in the delivery of a Mortgage File have been received, have been executed, appear to be what they purport to be, purport to be recorded or filed (as applicable) and have not been torn in any materially adverse manner or mutilated or otherwise defaced, and that such documents relate to the Mortgage Loans identified in the Mortgage Loan Schedule.  In so doing, the Custodian may rely on the purported due execution and genuineness of any such document and on the purported genuineness of any signature thereon.



 If at the conclusion of such review any document or documents constituting a part of a Mortgage File have not been executed or received, have not been recorded or filed (if required), are unrelated to the Mortgage Loans identified in the Mortgage Loan Schedule, appear not to be what they purport to be or have been torn in any materially adverse manner or mutilated or otherwise defaced, the Custodian shall promptly so notify (in the form attached as Exhibit M to this Agreement) the Trustee, the Directing Holder (but only if no Consultation Termination Event has occurred and is continuing), the Depositor, the Certificate Administrator, the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Operating Advisor and the related Mortgage Loan Seller by providing a written report, setting forth for each affected Mortgage Loan, with particularity, the nature of the defective or missing document.  The Depositor shall or shall cause the related Mortgage Loan Seller to deliver to the Custodian an executed, recorded or undamaged document, as applicable, or, if the failure to deliver such document in such form constitutes a Material Defect, the Depositor shall cause the related Mortgage Loan Seller to cure, repurchase or substitute for the related Mortgage Loan in the manner provided in Section 2.03(e) of this Agreement.   None of the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Certificate Administrator, the Custodian or the Trustee shall be responsible for any loss, cost, damage or expense to the Trust Fund resulting from any failure to receive any document constituting a portion of a Mortgage File noted on such a report or for any failure by the Depositor to use its best efforts to deliver any such document.



 Contemporaneously with its execution of this Agreement, the Depositor shall cause each Mortgage Loan Seller to deliver a power of attorney substantially in the form of Exhibit C to the applicable Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement to the Master Servicer and Special Servicer, that permits such parties to take such other action as is necessary to effect the delivery, assignment and/or recordation of any documents and/or instruments relating to any Mortgage Loan which have not been delivered, assigned or recorded at the time required for enforcement by the Trust Fund.  Pursuant to the related Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement, each of the Mortgage Loan Sellers will be required to effect (at the expense of the applicable Mortgage Loan Seller) the assignment and recordation of its respective Loan Documents until the assignment and recordation of all such Loan Documents has been completed.



 In reviewing any Mortgage File pursuant to the third preceding paragraph or Section 2.01 of this Agreement, the Master Servicer shall have no responsibility to cause the Custodian or Trustee to, and the Custodian or Trustee will have no responsibility to, examine any opinions or determine whether any document is legal, valid, binding, sufficient, duly authorized or enforceable, whether the text of any assignment or endorsement is in proper or recordable form (except, if applicable, to determine if the Trustee is the assignee or endorsee), whether any document has been recorded in accordance with the requirements of any applicable jurisdiction, whether a blanket assignment is permitted in any applicable jurisdiction, or whether any Person







 executing any document or rendering any opinion is authorized to do so or whether any signature thereon is genuine.



 The Custodian shall hold that portion of the Trust Fund delivered to the Custodian consisting of "instruments" (as such term is defined in Section 9-102 of the Uniform Commercial Code as in effect in Minnesota on the date hereof) in Minnesota and, except as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement, shall not remove such instruments from Minnesota, as applicable, unless it receives an Opinion of Counsel (obtained and delivered at the expense of the Person requesting the removal of such instruments from Minnesota) that if the transfer of the Mortgage Loans to the Trustee is deemed not to be a sale, after such removal, the Trustee will possess a first priority perfected security interest in such instruments.

 In the event that the Depositor, the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator, the Operating Advisor or the Custodian receives a Repurchase Communication of a Repurchase Request or a Repurchase Request Withdrawal, then such party shall promptly forward such Repurchase Communication of such Repurchase Request or Repurchase Request Withdrawal to the Master Servicer, if relating to a Performing Loan, or to the Special Servicer, if relating to a Specially Serviced Loan or REO Property, and include the following statement in the related







 correspondence:  "This is a "Repurchase Request [Withdrawal]" under Section 2.03(d) of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement relating to the COMM 2013-CCRE12 Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates requiring action by you as the recipient of such Repurchase Request or Repurchase Request Withdrawal thereunder".  Upon receipt of such Repurchase Communication of such Repurchase Request or Repurchase Request Withdrawal by the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as applicable, such party shall be deemed to be the Repurchase Request Recipient of such Repurchase Communication of such Repurchase Request or Repurchase Request Withdrawal, and such party shall comply with the procedures set forth in this Section 2.03(d) with respect to such Repurchase Request or Repurchase Request Withdrawal.  In no event shall the Custodian, by virtue of this provision, be required to provide any notice other than as set forth in Section 2.02 of this Agreement in connection with its review of the Mortgage File.



 (e)           A "Defect" shall exist with respect to a Mortgage Loan if any document constituting a part of the related Mortgage File has not been delivered within the time periods provided for in the related Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement, has not been properly executed, is missing, does not appear to be regular on its face or contains information that does not conform in any material respect with the corresponding information set forth in the Mortgage Loan Schedule.  A "Breach" shall mean a breach of any representation or warranty of any Mortgage Loan Seller made pursuant to the related Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement with respect to any Mortgage Loan.  If any party hereto discovers or receives notice of a Defect or a Breach, and if such Defect is a Material Defect or such Breach is a Material Breach, as applicable, then such party, on behalf of the Trust Fund, shall give prompt written notice thereof to the related Mortgage Loan Seller, the other parties hereto, the 17g-5 Information Provider (who shall promptly post such notice to the 17g-5 Information Provider's Website pursuant to Section 3.14(d) of this Agreement), the related Serviced Companion Loan Noteholder (if any) and, for so long as no Consultation Termination Event has occurred and is continuing, the Directing Holder.  If any such Defect or Breach materially and adversely affects the value of any Mortgage Loan, the value of the related Mortgaged Property or the interests of the Trustee in any Mortgage Loan or Mortgaged Property, or causes the related Mortgage Loan to be other than a "qualified mortgage" (within the meaning of Section 860G(a)(3) of the Code, without regard to the rule of Treasury Regulation Section 1.860G-2(f)(2) which causes a defective mortgage loan to be treated as a "qualified mortgage"), then such Defect shall constitute a "Material Defect" or such Breach shall constitute a "Material Breach," as the case may be; provided, that if any of the documents specified in Section 2.01(a)(i), Section 2.01(a)(ii), Section 2.01(a)(vii), Section 2.01(a)(xi) and Section 2.01(a)(xix) of this Agreement are not delivered as required in the related Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement, it shall be deemed a Material Defect.  The Custodian, the Certificate Administrator and the Trustee shall not be required to make any such determination.  Promptly upon receiving written notice of any such Material Defect or Material Breach with respect to a Mortgage Loan, accompanied by a written demand to take the actions contemplated by this sentence from the Depositor, the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator or the Custodian, on behalf of the Trust Fund, the applicable Mortgage Loan Seller shall, not later than 90 days from the applicable Mortgage Loan Seller's receipt of such notice of such Material Defect or Material Breach, as the case may be (or, in the case of a Material Defect or Material Breach relating to a Mortgage Loan not being a "qualified mortgage" as described in the second preceding sentence, not later than 90 days after the Mortgage Loan Seller or any party hereto discovering such Material Defect or Material







Breach) (any such 90-day period, the "Initial Resolution Period"), (i) cure the same in all material respects, (ii) repurchase the affected Mortgage Loan at the applicable Repurchase Price in conformity with the applicable Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement or (iii) substitute a Qualifying Substitute Mortgage Loan for such affected Mortgage Loan (provided that, in no event shall such substitution occur later than the second anniversary of the Closing Date) and pay to the Master Servicer for deposit into the Collection Account (or, with respect to any Serviced Loan Combination, the applicable Serviced Loan Combination Collection Account) any Substitution Shortfall Amount in connection therewith; provided that if (i) such Material Defect or Material Breach is capable of being cured but not within the Initial Resolution Period or, with respect to the immediately preceding proviso, the time period set forth therein, (ii) such Material Defect or Material Breach is not related to any Mortgage Loan's not being a "qualified mortgage" within the meaning of the REMIC Provisions and (iii) the Mortgage Loan Seller has commenced and is diligently proceeding with the cure of such Material Defect or Material Breach within the Initial Resolution Period, then the Mortgage Loan Seller shall have an additional period equal to the applicable Resolution Extension Period to complete such cure or, failing such cure, to repurchase the Mortgage Loan or substitute a Qualifying Substitute Mortgage Loan.  With respect to a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan, the related Mortgage Loan Seller agrees that any Defect as such term is defined in the related Other Pooling and Servicing Agreement (other than a Defect related to the promissory note for the related Companion Loan) will constitute a Defect under this Agreement.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Mortgage Loan is not secured by a Mortgaged Property that is, in whole or in part, a hotel, restaurant (operated by a Borrower), healthcare facility, nursing home, assisted living facility, self-storage facility, theatre or fitness center (operated by a Borrower), then the failure to deliver to the Custodian copies of the UCC financing statements with respect to such Mortgage Loan shall not be a Material Defect.



 Notwithstanding the foregoing, if there is a Material Breach or Material Defect with respect to one or more Mortgaged Properties with respect to a Mortgage Loan, the applicable Mortgage Loan Seller will not be obligated to repurchase the Mortgage Loan if (i) the affected Mortgaged Property may be released pursuant to the terms of any partial release provisions in the related Loan Documents (and such Mortgaged Property is, in fact, released), (ii) the remaining Mortgaged Property(ies) satisfy the requirements, if any, set forth in the Loan Documents and the Mortgage Loan Seller provides an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such release would not cause an Adverse REMIC Event to occur and (iii) each applicable Rating Agency has provided a No Downgrade Confirmation.



 If a Mortgage Loan Seller, in connection with a Material Defect or a Material Breach (or an allegation of a Material Defect or a Material Breach) pertaining to a Mortgage Loan, makes a cash payment pursuant to an agreement or a settlement between the applicable Mortgage Loan Seller and the Special Servicer on behalf of the Trust (and with the consent of the Directing Holder if no Control Termination Event has occurred and is continuing) (each such payment, a "Loss of Value Payment") with respect to such Mortgage Loan, the amount of such Loss of Value Payment shall be deposited into the Loss of Value Reserve Fund to be applied in accordance with Section 3.06(e) of this Agreement.  If such Loss of Value Payment is made, the Loss of Value Payment shall serve as the sole remedy available to the Certificateholders and the Trustee on their behalf regarding any such Material Breach or Material Defect in lieu of any obligation of the Mortgage Loan Seller to otherwise cure such Material Breach or Material







  Defect or repurchase or substitute for the affected Mortgage Loan based on such Material Breach or Material Defect under any circumstances.  This paragraph is intended to apply only to a mutual agreement or settlement between the applicable Mortgage Loan Seller and the Trust, provided, that (i) prior to any such agreement or settlement nothing in this paragraph shall preclude the Mortgage Loan Seller or the Trustee from exercising any of its rights related to a Material Defect or a Material Breach in the manner and timing set forth in the related Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement or this Section 2.03 (excluding this paragraph) (including any right to cure, repurchase or substitute for such Mortgage Loan), (ii) such Loss of Value Payment shall not be greater than the Repurchase Price of the affected Mortgage Loan; and (iii) a Material Defect or a Material Breach as a result of a Mortgage Loan not constituting a "qualified mortgage" within the meaning of Section 860G(a)(3) of the Code may not be cured by a Loss of Value Payment.



 If (x) there exists a breach of any representation or warranty on the part of a Mortgage Loan Seller as set forth in, or made pursuant to, certain representations set forth in the related Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement relating to fees and expenses payable by the Borrower associated with the exercise of a defeasance option, a waiver of a "due-on-sale" provision or a "due-on-encumbrance" provision or the release of any Mortgaged Property, and (y) the related Loan Documents specifically prohibit the Master Servicer or Special Servicer from requiring the related Borrower to pay such fees and expenses, then, upon notice by the Master Servicer or Special Servicer, such Mortgage Loan Seller may cure such breach by transferring to the Collection Account, within 90 days of the such Mortgage Loan Seller's receipt of such notice, the amount of any such fees and expenses borne by the Trust Fund that are the basis of such breach. Upon its making such deposit, such Mortgage Loan Seller shall be deemed to have cured such breach in all respects.  Provided such payment is made, this paragraph describes the sole remedy available to the Trust regarding any such breach, regardless of whether it constitutes a Material Breach, and the related Mortgage Loan Seller will not be obligated to repurchase or otherwise cure such breach.



 (f)           In connection with any repurchase of or substitution for a Mortgage Loan contemplated by this Section 2.03, (A) the Custodian, the Master Servicer (with respect to any Performing Loan) and the Special Servicer (with respect to any Specially Serviced Loan) shall each tender to the applicable Mortgage Loan Seller all portions of the Mortgage File (in the case of the Custodian) and the Servicing File (in the case of the Master Servicer and the Special Servicer, as applicable) and other documents pertaining to such Mortgage Loan possessed by it, upon delivery (i) to each of the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as applicable, of a trust receipt and (ii) to the Custodian by the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as applicable, of a Request for Release and an acknowledgement by the Master Servicer or Special Servicer, as applicable, of its receipt of the Repurchase Price or the Substitution Shortfall Amount from the applicable Mortgage Loan Seller, (B) each document that constitutes a part of the Mortgage File that was endorsed or assigned to the Trustee shall be endorsed or assigned without recourse in the form of endorsement or assignment provided to the Custodian by the applicable Mortgage Loan Seller, as the case may be, to the applicable Mortgage Loan Seller as shall be necessary to vest in the applicable Mortgage Loan Seller the legal and beneficial ownership of such Mortgage Loan to the extent such ownership was transferred to the Trustee (provided, that the Master Servicer or Special Servicer, as applicable, shall use reasonable efforts to cooperate in furnishing necessary information to the extent in its possession to the Mortgage Loan Seller in connection







 with such Mortgage Loan Seller's preparation of such endorsement or assignment) and (C) the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator, the Master Servicer and the Special Servicer shall release, or cause a release of, any escrow payments and reserve funds held by the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator, the Master Servicer and the Special Servicer, as applicable, or on the Trustee's, the Certificate Administrator's, the Master Servicer's and the Special Servicer's, as applicable, behalf, in respect of such Mortgage Loan to the applicable Mortgage Loan Seller.



 (g)           The Master Servicer (with respect to Performing Loans) and the Special Servicer (with respect to Specially Serviced Loans) shall, for the benefit of the Certificateholders and the Trustee, use reasonable efforts to enforce the obligations of the applicable Mortgage Loan Seller under Section 6 of the applicable Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement.  Such enforcement, including, without limitation, the legal prosecution of claims, shall be carried out in accordance with the Servicing Standard.  The Trustee, the Certificate Administrator, the Master Servicer and the Special Servicer, as the case may be, shall be reimbursed for the reasonable costs of such enforcement:  first, pursuant to Section 3.06 of this Agreement (with respect to the related Mortgage Loan), out of the related Repurchase Price or Substitution Shortfall Amount, as applicable, to the extent that such expenses are a specific component thereof; and second, if at the conclusion of such enforcement action it is determined that the amounts described in clause first are insufficient, then pursuant to Section 3.06 of this Agreement, out of general collections on the Mortgage Loans on deposit in the Collection Account in each case with interest thereon at the Advance Rate from the time such expense was incurred to, but excluding, the date such expense was reimbursed.  To the extent the applicable Mortgage Loan Seller prevails in such proceeding, such Mortgage Loan Seller shall be entitled to reimbursement from the Trust for all necessary and reasonable costs and expenses incurred in connection with such proceeding, including reasonable attorneys' fees.



 So long as document exceptions are outstanding, on each anniversary of the Closing Date, the Custodian shall prepare and forward to the Depositor, the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator, the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Controlling Class Representative (as identified to the Custodian by the Certificate Administrator) and the applicable Mortgage Loan Seller, a document exception report setting forth the then current status of any Defects related to the Mortgage Files pertaining to the Mortgage Loans sold by such Mortgage Loan Seller.



 As to any Qualifying Substitute Mortgage Loan, the Master Servicer (with respect to Performing Loans) or the Special Servicer (with respect to Specially Serviced Loans and REO Properties) shall direct the related Mortgage Loan Seller to deliver to the Custodian for such Qualifying Substitute Mortgage Loan (with a copy to the Master Servicer), the related Mortgage File with the related Note endorsed as required by Section 2.01(a)(i) hereof.  Monthly Payments due with respect to Qualifying Substitute Mortgage Loans in or prior to the month of substitution shall not be part of the Trust Fund and, if received by the Master Servicer, shall be remitted by the Master Servicer to the related Mortgage Loan Seller on the next succeeding Distribution Date.  For the month of repurchase or substitution, distributions to Certificateholders will include the Monthly Payment(s) due on the related Removed Mortgage Loan, if and to the extent received by the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer on behalf of the Trust on or prior to the related date of repurchase or substitution, as applicable, and such Mortgage Loan Seller shall be entitled to retain all amounts received thereafter in respect of such Removed Mortgage Loan.







 In any month in which a Mortgage Loan Seller substitutes one or more Qualifying Substitute Mortgage Loans for one or more Removed Mortgage Loans, the Master Servicer will determine the applicable Substitution Shortfall Amount and promptly notify the Certificate Administrator thereof.  Promptly upon receipt of such notice, the Certificate Administrator shall direct such Mortgage Loan Seller to deposit into the Collection Account and/or the applicable Serviced Loan Combination Collection Account, as applicable, cash equal to such amount concurrently with the delivery of the Mortgage Files for such Qualifying Substitute Mortgage Loans, without any reimbursement thereof.  The Certificate Administrator shall also direct such Mortgage Loan Seller to give written notice to the Depositor, the Trustee and the Master Servicer of such deposit.  The Certificate Administrator shall cause its Distribution Date Statement to reflect the removal of each Removed Mortgage Loan and, if applicable, the substitution of the Qualifying Substitute Mortgage Loan.  Upon any such substitution, the Qualifying Substitute Mortgage Loans shall be subject to the terms of this Agreement in all respects.



 It is understood and agreed that Section 6 of the Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreements provides the sole remedy available to the Certificateholders and the Trustee on behalf of the Certificateholders respecting any Breach (including a Breach with respect to a Mortgage Loan failing to constitute a Qualified Mortgage) or any Defect.



 (h)           In the event that any litigation is commenced which alleges facts which, in the judgment of the Depositor, could constitute a breach of any of the Depositor's representations and warranties relating to the Mortgage Loans, the Depositor hereby reserves the right to conduct the defense of such litigation at its expense and shall not be required to obtain any consent from the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer or the Directing Holder, unless such defense results in any liability of the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer or the Directing Holder, as applicable.



 (i)           If for any reason a Mortgage Loan Seller fails to fulfill its obligations under the related Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement with respect to any Mortgage Loan, the Master Servicer (with respect to Performing Loans) and the Special Servicer (with respect to Specially Serviced Loans) shall use reasonable efforts in enforcing any obligation of such Mortgage Loan Seller to cure, repurchase or substitute for such Mortgage Loan under the terms of the related Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement all at the expense of such Mortgage Loan Seller.

 ADMINISTRATION AND SERVICING OF THE TRUST FUND



 Section 3.01     The Master Servicer To Act as Master Servicer; Special Servicer To Act as Special Servicer; Administration of the Mortgage Loans and the Serviced Companion Loans.  (a)  The Master Servicer (generally with respect to Mortgage Loans (other than a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan) and Serviced Companion Loans that are not Specially Serviced Loans) and the Special Servicer (generally with respect to Specially Serviced Loans and Serviced REO Loans), each as an independent contractor servicer, shall service and administer the Mortgage Loans (other than a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan) and the Serviced Companion Loans on behalf of the Trust Fund and the Trustee (as Trustee for the Certificateholders) and, in the case of any Serviced Loan Combination, the related Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders, (as a collective whole as if such Certificateholders and Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders, as applicable, constituted a single lender), in each case, in accordance with the Servicing Standard.



 The Master Servicer's or Special Servicer's liability for actions and omissions in its capacity as Master Servicer or Special Servicer, as the case may be, hereunder is limited as provided herein (including, without limitation, pursuant to Section 6.03 hereof).  To the extent consistent with the foregoing and subject to any express limitations set forth in this Agreement, the Master Servicer and Special Servicer shall seek to maximize the timely and complete recovery of principal and interest on the Notes; provided, that nothing herein contained shall be construed as an express or implied guarantee by the Master Servicer or Special Servicer of the collectability of the Mortgage Loans or the Serviced Companion Loans.  Subject only to the Servicing Standard, the Master Servicer and Special Servicer shall have full power and authority, acting alone or through sub-servicers (subject to paragraph (c) of this Section 3.01, to the related sub-servicing agreement with each sub-servicer and to Section 3.01(e) of this Agreement), to do or cause to be done any and all things in connection with such servicing and administration that it may deem consistent with the Servicing Standard and, in its reasonable judgment, in the best interests of the Certificateholders, including, without limitation, with respect to each Mortgage Loan (other than any Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan, and in the case of the Serviced Loan Combinations, in the best interests of the Certificateholders and the Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders, as a collective whole as if such Certificateholders and (with respect to a Serviced Loan Combination) Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders constituted a single lender) to prepare, execute and deliver, on behalf of the Certificateholders and Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders and the Trustee or any of them:  (i) any and all financing statements, continuation statements and other documents or instruments necessary to maintain the lien on each Mortgaged Property and related collateral; (ii) any modifications, waivers, consents or amendments to or with respect to any documents contained in the related Mortgage File; and (iii) any and all instruments of satisfaction or cancellation, or of partial or full release or discharge, and all other comparable instruments, with respect to such Mortgage Loans and the Mortgaged Properties.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Master Servicer nor the Special Servicer shall modify, amend, waive or otherwise consent to any change of the terms of any Mortgage Loan except







 under the circumstances described in Section 3.03, Section 3.09, Section 3.10, Section 3.24, Section 3.25, Section 3.26 and Section 3.27 hereof.  The Master Servicer (with respect to Mortgage Loans (other than a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan) and Serviced Companion Loans that are not Specially Serviced Loans) and the Special Servicer (with respect to Specially Serviced Loans and Serviced REO Loans) shall provide to the Borrowers related to such Mortgage Loans that it is servicing any reports required to be provided to them pursuant to the related Loan Documents.  Subject to Section 3.11 of this Agreement, the Trustee shall, upon the receipt of a written request of a Servicing Officer, execute and deliver to the Master Servicer and Special Servicer, as applicable, any powers of attorney (substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit CC, or such other form as mutually agreed to by the Trustee and the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as applicable) and other documents (including but not limited to other powers of attorney) prepared by the Master Servicer and Special Servicer, as applicable, and necessary or appropriate (as certified in such written request) to enable the Master Servicer and Special Servicer, as applicable, to carry out their servicing and administrative duties hereunder.  The Trustee shall not be held liable for any misuse of any such power of attorney or such other documents by the Master Servicer and Special Servicer, as applicable.  Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, none of the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer shall, without the Trustee's written consent:  (i) initiate any action, suit or proceeding solely under the Trustee's name without indicating the Master Servicer's or the Special Servicer's, as the case may be, representative capacity (unless prohibited by any requirement of the applicable jurisdiction in which any such action, suit or proceeding is brought and if so prohibited, in the manner required by such jurisdiction (provided that the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as applicable, shall then provide five (5) Business Days' written notice to the Trustee of the initiation of such action, suit or proceeding (or such shorter time period as is reasonably required in the judgment of the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as applicable, made in accordance with the Servicing Standard) prior to filing such action, suit or proceeding), and shall not be required to obtain the Trustee's consent or indicate the Master Servicer's or the Special Servicer's, as applicable, representative capacity); or (ii) take any action with the intent to cause, and that actually causes, the Trustee to be registered to do business in any state.



 (b)          Unless otherwise provided in the related Note or related Intercreditor Agreement, the Master Servicer shall apply any partial Principal Prepayment received on a Mortgage Loan (other than a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan) or Serviced Companion Loan, as applicable, on a date other than a Due Date to the Stated Principal Balance of such Mortgage Loan (other than a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan) or Serviced Companion Loan, as applicable, as of the Due Date immediately following the date of receipt of such partial Principal Prepayment.  Unless otherwise provided in the related Note or related Intercreditor Agreement, the Master Servicer shall apply any amounts received on UxxPDSxxPD Treasury obligations in respect of a Mortgage Loan (other than a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan) or Serviced Companion Loan, as applicable, being defeased pursuant to its terms to the Stated Principal Balance of and interest on such Mortgage Loan or Serviced Companion Loan, as applicable, as of the Due Date immediately following the receipt of such amounts.



 (c)           The Master Servicer and the Special Servicer, may enter into Sub-Servicing Agreements with third parties with respect to any of its respective obligations hereunder, provided that (i) any such agreement requires the Sub-Servicer to comply in all material respects with all of the applicable terms and conditions of this Agreement and shall be







 consistent with the provisions of this Agreement, the terms of the respective Loan Documents and, in the case of a Serviced Companion Loan, the related Intercreditor Agreement, (ii) if such Sub-Servicer is a Servicing Function Participant or an Additional Servicer, any such agreement provides that (x) the failure of such Sub-Servicer to comply with any of the requirements under Article X of this Agreement applicable to such Sub-Servicer, including the failure to deliver any reports or certificates at the time such report or certification is required under Article X and (y) the failure of such Sub-Servicer to comply with any requirements to deliver any items required by Items 1122 and 1123 of Regulation AB under any other pooling and servicing agreement relating to any other series of certificates offered by the Depositor shall constitute an event of default by such Sub-Servicer upon the occurrence of which the Master Servicer shall (and the Depositor may) immediately terminate the related Sub-Servicer under the related Sub-Servicing Agreement, which termination shall be deemed for cause, (iii) no Sub-Servicer retained by the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as applicable, shall grant any modification, waiver or amendment to any Mortgage Loan or Serviced Companion Loan, as applicable, or foreclose any Mortgage without the approval of the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as applicable, which approval shall be given or withheld in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 3.09, Section 3.10, Section 3.24, Section 3.25, Section 3.26, Section 3.27, (as applicable), (iv) such agreement shall be consistent with the Servicing Standard and (v) with respect to any Sub-Servicing Agreement entered into after the Closing Date, if such Sub-Servicer is a Servicing Function Participant or an Additional Servicer, such Sub-Servicer, at the time the related Sub-Servicing Agreement is entered into, is not a Prohibited Party.  Any such Sub-Servicing Agreement may permit the Sub-Servicer to delegate its duties to agents or Subcontractors so long as the related agreements or arrangements with such agents or Subcontractors are consistent with the provisions of this Section 3.01(c) (including, for the avoidance of doubt, that no such agent or Subcontractor is a Prohibited Party, if such agent or Subcontractor would be a Servicing Function Participant, at the time the related sub-servicing agreement is entered into).  Any monies received by a Sub-Servicer pursuant to a Sub-Servicing agreement (other than sub-servicing fees) shall be deemed to be received by the Master Servicer on the date received by such Sub-Servicer.



 Any Sub-Servicing Agreement entered into by the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as applicable, shall provide that it may be assumed by the Trustee (in its sole discretion, but must be assumed with respect to any Mortgage Loan Seller Sub-Servicer so long as such Mortgage Loan Seller Sub-Servicer is not in default under the applicable Sub-Servicing Agreement) if the Trustee has assumed the duties of the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, respectively, or any successor Master Servicer or Special Servicer, as applicable, without cost or obligation to the assuming party or the Trust Fund, upon the assumption by such party of the obligations, except to the extent they arose prior to the date of assumption, of the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as applicable, pursuant to Section 7.02 (it being understood that any such obligations shall be the obligations of the terminated Master Servicer or Special Servicer, as applicable, only).



 Any Sub-Servicing Agreement, and any other transactions or services relating to the Mortgage Loans or Serviced Companion Loans involving a Sub-Servicer, shall be deemed to be between the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as applicable, and such Sub-Servicer alone, and the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator, the Trust Fund, the Operating Advisor, the Certificateholders and, if applicable, Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders shall not be deemed







 parties thereto and shall have no claims, rights (except as specified below), obligations, duties or liabilities with respect to the Sub-Servicer, except as set forth in Section 3.01(c)(ii) and Section 3.01(d).



 Any Sub-Servicing Agreement as to which a Mortgage Loan Seller required the Master Servicer to enter into shall provide that the Master Servicer (and any successor Master Servicer) or Trustee may only terminate the related Mortgage Loan Seller Sub-Servicer for cause pursuant to such Sub-Servicing Agreement and as otherwise specified in such Sub-Servicing Agreement.



 Notwithstanding the provisions of any Sub-Servicing Agreement and this Section 3.01, in no event shall the Trust Fund, the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator, the Depositor or any Serviced Companion Loan Noteholder bear any termination fee required to be paid to any Sub-Servicer as a result of the termination of any Sub-Servicing Agreement.



 Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Special Servicer shall not enter into any Sub-Servicing Agreement which provides for the performance by third parties of any or all of its obligations herein, without the consent of the Directing Holder for so long as no Control Termination Event has occurred and is continuing, except to the extent necessary for the Special Servicer to comply with applicable regulatory requirements.



 (d)          If the Trustee or any successor Master Servicer assumes the obligations of the Master Servicer, or if the Trustee or any successor Special Servicer assumes the obligations of the Special Servicer, in each case in accordance with Section 7.02, the Trustee, the successor Master Servicer or such successor Special Servicer, as applicable, to the extent necessary to permit the Trustee, the successor Master Servicer or such successor Special Servicer, as applicable, to carry out the provisions of Section 7.02, shall, without act or deed on the part of the Trustee, the successor Master Servicer or such successor Special Servicer, as applicable, succeed to all of the rights and obligations of the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as applicable, under any Sub-Servicing Agreement entered into by the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as applicable, pursuant to Section 3.01(c).  In such event, such successor shall be deemed to have assumed all of the Master Servicer's or the Special Servicer's interest, as applicable, therein (but not any liabilities or obligations in respect of acts or omissions of the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as applicable, prior to such deemed assumption) and to have replaced the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as applicable, as a party to such Sub-Servicing Agreement to the same extent as if such Sub-Servicing Agreement had been assigned to such successor, except that the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as applicable, shall not thereby be relieved of any liability or obligations under such Sub-Servicing Agreement that accrued prior to the succession of such successor.



 If the Trustee or any successor Master Servicer or Special Servicer, as applicable, assumes the servicing obligations of the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as applicable, then upon request of such successor, the Master Servicer or Special Servicer, as applicable, shall at its own expense (except (i) in the event that the Special Servicer is terminated pursuant to Section 3.22(b), at the expense of the Certificateholders effecting such termination, as applicable; or (ii) in the event that the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer is terminated pursuant to Section 6.04(c), at the expense of the Trust) deliver to such successor all documents and records relating to any Sub-Servicing Agreement and the Mortgage Loans and/or the







 Serviced Companion Loans, as applicable, then being serviced hereunder or thereunder and an accounting of amounts collected and held by it, if any, and shall otherwise use commercially reasonable efforts to effect the orderly and efficient transfer of any Sub-Servicing Agreement to such successor.  The Master Servicer shall not be required to assume the obligations of the Special Servicer and nothing in this paragraph shall imply otherwise.



 (e)           The parties hereto acknowledge that each Loan Combination is subject to the terms and conditions of the related Intercreditor Agreement and, with respect to a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan, further subject to the servicing under and all other terms and conditions of the Other Pooling and Servicing Agreement.  The parties hereto further recognize the respective rights and obligations of each Companion Loan Noteholder under the related Intercreditor Agreement, including, without limitation with respect to (A) the allocation of collections (and all other amounts received in connection with the related Loan Combination) on or in respect of the related Mortgage Loan and (B) the allocation of Default Interest on or in respect of the related Mortgage Loan.



 Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the Master Servicer's and the Special Servicer's obligations and responsibilities hereunder and the Master Servicer's and the Special Servicer's authority with respect to the Serviced Loan Combinations are limited by and subject to the terms of the related Intercreditor Agreement and, with respect to any Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan, the rights of the Other Servicer and the Other Special Servicer under the Other Pooling and Servicing Agreement.  The Master Servicer shall, consistent with the applicable Servicing Standard, enforce the rights of the Trustee (as holder of a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan) under the related Intercreditor Agreement and the Other Pooling and Servicing Agreement.  The parties hereto acknowledge that each Non-Serviced Loan Combination and any related REO Property are being serviced and administered under the related Other Pooling and Servicing Agreement and the Other Servicer will make any property advances required thereunder in respect of such Non-Serviced Loan Combination and remit collections on the Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan to or on behalf of the Trust. None of the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Certificate Administrator or the Trustee shall have any obligation or authority to supervise the related Other Servicer, the related Other Special Servicer or the related Other Trustee or to make Property Advances with respect to any such Non-Serviced Loan Combination.  Although each Non-Serviced Loan Combination is being serviced under the related Other Pooling and Servicing Agreement, the Controlling Class Representative may have certain information and consultation rights relating to the servicing of the Non-Serviced Loan Combination pursuant to the terms of the related Intercreditor Agreement and the related Other Pooling and Servicing Agreement.  Any obligation of the Master Servicer or Special Servicer, as applicable, to provide information and collections to the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator and the Certificateholders with respect to any Non-Serviced Loan Combination shall be dependent on its receipt of the corresponding information and collections from the related Other Servicer or the related Other Special Servicer.



 If any Mortgage Loan included in any Serviced Loan Combination is no longer part of the Trust Fund and the servicing and administration of such Serviced Loan Combination is to be governed by a separate servicing agreement and not by this Agreement, the Master Servicer and, if such Serviced Loan Combination is then being specially serviced hereunder, the Special Servicer, shall continue to act in such capacities under such separate servicing







 agreement, which agreement shall be reasonably acceptable to the Master Servicer and/or the Special Servicer, as the case may be, and shall contain servicing and administration, limitation of liability, indemnification and servicing compensation provisions substantially similar to the corresponding provisions of this Agreement, except that such Serviced Loan Combination and the related Mortgaged Property shall be serviced as if they were the sole assets serviced and administered thereunder and the sole source of funds thereunder and except that there shall be no further obligation of any Person to make P&I Advances.  All amounts due the Master Servicer and the Special Servicer (including Advances and interest thereon) pursuant to this Agreement and the applicable Intercreditor Agreement shall be paid to the Master Servicer and the Special Servicer by the successor Master Servicer or Special Servicer, as applicable, or as an Additional Trust Fund Expense on the first Servicer Remittance Date following termination.  In addition, until such time as a separate servicing agreement with respect to such Serviced Loan Combination and any related Serviced REO Property has been entered into and, notwithstanding that neither such Mortgage Loan nor any related Serviced REO Property is part of the Trust Fund, the Custodian shall continue to hold the Mortgage File and the Master Servicer and, if applicable, the Special Servicer shall (subject to the preceding sentence) continue to service such Serviced Loan Combination or any related Serviced REO Property, as the case may be, under this Agreement as if it were a separate servicing agreement.  Nothing herein shall be deemed to override the provisions of an Intercreditor Agreement with respect to the rights of the related noteholders thereunder and with respect to the servicing and administrative duties and obligations with respect to such Serviced Loan Combinations.  In the event of any inconsistency or discrepancy between the provisions, terms or conditions of an Intercreditor Agreement related to a Serviced Loan Combination and the provisions, terms or conditions of this Agreement, except as provided in Section 3.23(f), the related Intercreditor Agreement shall govern, and as to any matter on which such Intercreditor Agreement is silent or makes reference to this Agreement, this Agreement shall govern.



 Section 3.02     Liability of the Master Servicer and the Special Servicer When Sub-Servicing.  Notwithstanding any Sub-Servicing Agreement, any of the provisions of this Agreement relating to agreements or arrangements between the Master Servicer or Special Servicer, as applicable, and any Person acting as sub-servicer (or its agents or Subcontractors) or any reference to actions taken through any Person acting as sub-servicer or otherwise, the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as applicable, shall remain obligated and primarily liable to the Trustee (on behalf of the Certificateholders), the Certificateholders and, with respect to the Serviced Loan Combinations, the Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders, for the servicing and administering of the Mortgage Loans and Serviced Companion Loans in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement without diminution of such obligation or liability by virtue of such sub-servicing agreements or arrangements or by virtue of indemnification from the Depositor or any other Person acting as sub-servicer (or its agents or Subcontractors) to the same extent and under the same terms and conditions as if the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as applicable, alone were servicing and administering the Mortgage Loans and Serviced Companion Loans.  Each of the Master Servicer and the Special Servicer shall be entitled to enter into an agreement with any sub-servicer providing for indemnification of the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as applicable, by such sub-servicer, and nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to limit or modify such indemnification, but no such agreement for indemnification shall be deemed to limit or modify this Agreement.







 Section 3.03     Collection of Mortgage Loan and Serviced Companion Loan Payments. The Master Servicer (with respect to all the Mortgage Loans (other than a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan) and the Serviced Companion Loans (other than Specially Serviced Loans) that the Master Servicer is Servicing) and the Special Servicer (with respect to Specially Serviced Loans) shall use reasonable efforts to collect all payments called for under the terms and provisions of the Mortgage Loans (other than a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan) and the Serviced Companion Loans each is obligated to service hereunder, and shall follow the Servicing Standard with respect to such collection procedures; provided, that nothing herein contained shall be construed as an express or implied guarantee by the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer of the collectability of the Mortgage Loans or the Serviced Companion Loans; provided, further, that with respect to such Mortgage Loans (other than a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan) or Serviced Loan Combinations, as applicable, that have Anticipated Repayment Dates, so long as the related Borrower is in compliance with each provision of the related Loan Documents, the Master Servicer and Special Servicer (including the Special Servicer in its capacity as a Certificateholder, if applicable) shall not take any enforcement action with respect to the failure of the related Borrower to make any payment of Excess Interest, other than requests for collection, until the final maturity date of such Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combinations, as applicable, or the outstanding principal balance of such Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combinations, as applicable, has been paid in full, however, consistent with the applicable Servicing Standard, the Master Servicer, or the Special Servicer each may in its discretion waive the Excess Interest (even at the final maturity date) in connection with any Mortgage Loan it is obligated to service hereunder if taking such action is in the best interest of the Certificateholders as a collective whole.  With respect to each Performing Loan (other than a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan), the Master Servicer shall use its reasonable efforts, consistent with the Servicing Standard, to collect income statements and rent rolls from Borrowers as required by the Loan Documents and the terms hereof.  The Master Servicer shall provide at least 90 days' notice (with a copy to the Special Servicer) to the Borrowers of Balloon Payments coming due on Performing Loans (other than a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan).

With respect to each Specially Serviced Loan, the Special Servicer shall use its reasonable efforts, consistent with the Servicing Standard, to collect income statements and rent rolls from Borrowers as required by the Loan Documents.

The Master Servicer shall be entitled to reimbursement of Property Advances, with interest thereon at the Advance Rate, that it makes pursuant to this Section 3.04 of this Agreement from amounts received on or in respect of the related Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination respecting which such Advance was made or if such Advance has become a Nonrecoverable Advance, to the extent permitted by Section 3.06 of this Agreement.  No costs incurred by the Master Servicer in effecting the payment of taxes and assessments on the Mortgaged Properties shall, for the purpose of calculating distributions to Certificateholders or Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders, be added to the amount owing under the related Mortgage Loans or Serviced Companion Loans, notwithstanding that the terms of such Mortgage Loans or Serviced Companion Loans so permit.

The Other Servicer (or other service provider) shall be entitled to reimbursement for nonrecoverable property advances (as such term or similar term may be defined in the related Other Pooling and Servicing Agreement) with, in each case, any accrued and unpaid interest thereon provided for under the related Other Pooling and Servicing Agreement in the manner set forth in such Other Pooling and Servicing Agreement, the related Intercreditor Agreement and Section 3.06(a)(v) of this Agreement.

The Master Servicer shall also deposit into each Escrow Account any amounts representing losses on Permitted Investments to the extent required pursuant to Section 3.07(b) of this Agreement and any Insurance Proceeds or Liquidation Proceeds which are required to be applied to the restoration or repair of any Mortgaged Property pursuant to the related Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination.  Escrow Accounts shall be Eligible Accounts (except to the extent the related Loan







 Documents require it to be held in an account that is not an Eligible Account); provided, if the ratings of the financial institution holding such account are downgraded to a ratings level below that of an Eligible Account (except to the extent the related Loan Documents require it to be held in an account that is not an Eligible Account), the Master Servicer shall have 30 days (or such longer time as confirmed by a No Downgrade Confirmation, obtained at the expense of the Master Servicer relating to the Certificates and any related Serviced Companion Loan Securities) to transfer such account to an Eligible Account.

 (v)         to pay from time to time to the related Borrower any interest or investment income earned on funds deposited in the Escrow Account if such income is required to be paid to the related Borrower under law or by the terms of the Loan Documents for such Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination, or otherwise to the Master Servicer; or



 (vi)        to remove any funds deposited in an Escrow Account that were not required to be deposited therein or to refund amounts to Borrowers determined to be overages.

 (c)          The Master Servicer shall, as to each Mortgage Loan (other than any Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan) and each Serviced Companion Loan that it is servicing, (i) maintain accurate records with respect to the related Mortgaged Property reflecting the status of real estate taxes, assessments and other similar items that are or may become a lien thereon and the status of insurance premiums and any ground rents payable in respect thereof and (ii) use reasonable efforts to obtain, from time to time, all bills for (or otherwise confirm) the payment of such items (including renewal premiums) and, for such Mortgage Loans and Serviced Companion Loans that require the related Borrower to escrow for such items, shall effect payment thereof prior to







 the applicable penalty or termination date.  For purposes of effecting any such payment for which it is responsible, the Master Servicer shall apply Escrow Payments as allowed under the terms of the related Loan Documents for such Mortgage Loan and Serviced Companion Loan (or, if such Mortgage Loan or Serviced Companion Loan does not require the related Borrower to escrow for the payment of real estate taxes, assessments, insurance premiums, ground rents (if applicable) and similar items, the Master Servicer shall use reasonable efforts consistent with the Servicing Standard to cause the related Borrower to comply with the requirement of the related Loan Documents that the Borrower make payments in respect of such items at the time they first become due and, in any event, prior to the institution of foreclosure or similar proceedings with respect to the related Mortgaged Property for nonpayment of such items).  Subject to Section 3.21 of this Agreement, the Master Servicer shall timely make a Property Advance with respect to the Mortgage Loans (other than Non-Serviced Mortgage Loans) and Serviced Loan Combinations that it is servicing, if any, to cover any such item which is not so paid, including any penalties or other charges arising from the Borrower's failure to timely pay such items.

 Upon receipt of any of the amounts described in clauses (i), (ii), (v) and (vi) of this Agreement above with respect to any Specially Serviced Loan which is not a Serviced REO Loan, the Special Servicer shall remit such amounts within one Business Day after receipt thereof (except, if such amounts are not properly identified, the Special Servicer shall promptly identify such amounts and shall remit such amounts within one Business Day after such identification) to the Master Servicer for deposit into the Collection Account in accordance with the second paragraph of this Section 3.05 of this Agreement, unless the Special Servicer determines, consistent with the Servicing Standard, that a particular item should not be deposited because of a restrictive endorsement or other appropriate reason.

 The Trustee, the Certificate Administrator, the Custodian, CREFC®, the Special Servicer, the Master Servicer, the Operating Advisor and the Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan Service Providers (to the extent specified in Section 11.12) shall in all cases have a right prior to the Certificateholders to any funds on deposit in the Collection Account from time to time for the reimbursement or payment of the Servicing Compensation (including investment income), Trustee/Certificate Administrator Fees, Special Servicing Compensation (including investment income), the CREFC® License Fee, Operating Advisor Fees, Operating Advisor Consulting Fees (but only to the extent such Operating Advisor Consulting Fees are actually received from the Borrowers), Advances, Advance Interest Amounts, (for each of such Persons other than CREFC®) their respective indemnification payments (if any) pursuant to Section 6.03, Section 8.05 or Section 11.02 of this Agreement, and (for each of such Persons other than CREFC®) their respective expenses hereunder to the extent such fees and expenses are to be reimbursed or paid from amounts on deposit in the Collection Account pursuant to this Agreement.  For the avoidance of doubt, any fees or expenses (including legal fees) for which a party is to be indemnified pursuant to Section 6.03 herein may be submitted directly to the Trust Fund and paid from amounts on deposit in the Collection Account on behalf of such party pursuant to this Agreement. In addition, the Certificate Administrator, the Trustee, the Special Servicer, the Master Servicer and the Operating Advisor shall in all cases have a right prior to the Certificateholders to any funds on deposit in the Collection Account from time to time for the reimbursement and payment of any federal, state or local taxes imposed on either Trust REMIC.



 Upon the determination that a previously made Advance is a Nonrecoverable Advance, to the extent that the reimbursement thereof would exceed the full amount of the principal portion of general collections on the Mortgage Loans (or with respect to Property Advances, the Serviced Loan Combinations) deposited in the Collection Account and available for distribution on the next Distribution Date, the Master Servicer or the Trustee, each at its own option and in its sole discretion, as applicable, instead of obtaining reimbursement for the remaining amount of such Nonrecoverable Advance pursuant to Section 3.06(a) or Section 3.06(b) of this Agreement immediately, may elect to refrain from obtaining such reimbursement for such portion of the Nonrecoverable Advance during the Collection Period ending on the then-current Determination Date for successive one-month periods for a total period not to exceed 12 months (with the consent of the Directing Holder, for so long as no







 Control Termination Event has occurred and is continuing, for any deferral in excess of 6 months).  If the Master Servicer or the Trustee makes such an election at its sole option and in its sole discretion to defer reimbursement with respect to all or a portion of a Nonrecoverable Advance (together with interest thereon), then such Nonrecoverable Advance (together with interest thereon) or portion thereof shall continue to be fully reimbursable in the subsequent Collection Period (subject, again, to the same sole discretion to elect to defer; it is acknowledged that, in such a subsequent period, such Nonrecoverable Advance shall again be payable first from principal collections as described above prior to payment from other collections).  In connection with a potential election by the Master Servicer or the Trustee to refrain from the reimbursement of a particular Nonrecoverable Advance or portion thereof during the one-month Collection Period ending on the related Determination Date for any Distribution Date, the Master Servicer or the Trustee shall further be authorized (in its sole discretion) to wait for principal collections on the Mortgage Loans and Serviced Companion Loans to be received before making its determination of whether to refrain from the reimbursement of a particular Nonrecoverable Advance (or portion thereof) until the end of such Collection Period; provided, the Master Servicer or the Trustee shall give notice of its election to the 17g-5 Information Provider (who shall promptly post such notice to the 17g-5 Information Provider's Website pursuant to Section 3.14(d) of this Agreement), at least 15 days prior to any reimbursement to it of Nonrecoverable Advances from amounts in the Collection Account allocable to interest on the Mortgage Loans unless (1) the Master Servicer or the Trustee determines in its sole discretion that waiting 15 days after such a notice could jeopardize its ability to recover Nonrecoverable Advances, (2) changed circumstances or new or different information becomes known to the Master Servicer or the Trustee that could affect or cause a determination of whether any Advance is a Nonrecoverable Advance, whether to defer reimbursement of a Nonrecoverable Advance or the determination in clause (1) above, or (3) the Master Servicer or the Trustee has not timely received from the Certificate Administrator information requested by the Master Servicer or the Trustee to consider in determining whether to defer reimbursement of a Nonrecoverable Advance; provided that, if clause (1), (2) or (3) apply, the Master Servicer or the Trustee shall give notice of an anticipated reimbursement to it of Nonrecoverable Advances from amounts in the Collection Account allocable to interest on the Mortgage Loans as soon as reasonably practicable in such circumstances to the 17g-5 Information Provider (who shall promptly post such notice to the 17g-5 Information Provider's Website pursuant to Section 3.14(d) of this Agreement).  Neither the Master Servicer nor the Trustee shall have any liability for any loss, liability or expense resulting from any notice provided to each Rating Agency contemplated by the immediately preceding sentence.



 The foregoing shall not, however, be construed to limit any liability that may otherwise be imposed on such Person for any failure by such Person to comply with the conditions to making such an election under this Section 3.06(a) or to comply with the terms of this Section 3.06(a) and the other provisions of this Agreement that apply once such an election, if any, has been made.  If the Master Servicer or the Trustee, as applicable, determines, in its sole discretion, that it should recover the Nonrecoverable Advances without deferral as described above, then the Master Servicer or the Trustee, as applicable, shall be entitled to immediate reimbursement of Nonrecoverable Advances with interest thereon at the Advance Rate from all amounts in the Collection Accounts for such Distribution Date.  Any such election by any such party to refrain from reimbursing itself or obtaining reimbursement for any Nonrecoverable Advance or portion thereof with respect to any one or more Collection Periods shall not limit the







 accrual of interest at the Advance Rate on such Nonrecoverable Advance for the period prior to the actual reimbursement of such Nonrecoverable Advance.  The Master Servicer's or the Trustee's, as applicable, election to defer reimbursement of such Nonrecoverable Advances as set forth above is an accommodation to the Certificateholders and, as applicable, the Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders and shall not be construed as an obligation on the part of the Master Servicer or the Trustee, as applicable, or a right of the Certificateholders or the Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders.  Nothing herein shall be deemed to create in the Certificateholders or the Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders a right to prior payment of distributions over the Master Servicer's or the Trustee's, as applicable, right to reimbursement for Advances (deferred or otherwise).  In all events, the decision to defer reimbursement or to seek immediate reimbursement of Nonrecoverable Advances shall be deemed to be in accordance with the Servicing Standard and neither the Master Servicer, the Trustee nor the other parties to this Agreement shall have any liability to one another or to any of the Certificateholders or any of the Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders for any such election that such party makes as contemplated by this Section 3.06(a) or for any losses, damages or other adverse economic or other effects that may arise from such an election.



 None of the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer or the Trustee shall be permitted to reverse any other Person's determination that an Advance is a Nonrecoverable Advance.



 If the Master Servicer, the Trustee or any Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan Service Provider, as applicable, is reimbursed out of general collections for any unreimbursed Advances that are determined to be Nonrecoverable Advances (together with any Advance Interest Amount), then (for purposes of calculating distributions on the Certificates) such reimbursement and payment of interest shall be deemed to have been made:  first, out of the Principal Distribution Amount, which, but for its application to reimburse a Nonrecoverable Advance and/or to pay the Advance Interest Amount, would be included in Available Funds for any subsequent Distribution Date and, second, out of other amounts which, but for their application to reimburse a Nonrecoverable Advance and/or to pay the Advance Interest Amount, would be included in Available Funds for any subsequent Distribution Date.



 If and to the extent that any payment is deemed to be applied as contemplated in the paragraph above to reimburse a Nonrecoverable Advance or to pay the Advance Interest Amount, then the Principal Distribution Amount for such Distribution Date shall be reduced, to not less than zero, by the amount of such reimbursement.  If and to the extent (i) any Advance is determined to be a Nonrecoverable Advance, (ii) such Advance and/or the Advance Interest Amount is reimbursed out of the Principal Distribution Amount as contemplated above and (iii) the particular item for which such Advance was originally made is subsequently collected out of payments or other collections in respect of the related Mortgage Loan, then the Principal Distribution Amount for the Distribution Date that corresponds to the Collection Period in which such item was recovered shall be increased by an amount equal to the lesser of (A) the amount of such item and (B) any previous reduction in the Principal Distribution Amount for a prior Distribution Date as contemplated in the paragraph above resulting from the reimbursement of the subject Advance and/or the payment of the Advance Interest Amount.



 (b)           The Master Servicer shall maintain a separate Trust Ledger with respect to the Serviced Loan Combinations that it is servicing on which it shall make ledger entries as to







 amounts deposited (or credited) or withdrawn (or debited) with respect thereto.  On each Servicer Remittance Date (or such other date as may be specified below or on which funds are available for such purpose as specified below), with respect to each Serviced Loan Combination, the Master Servicer shall make withdrawals from amounts allocated thereto in the related Serviced Loan Combination Collection Account (and may debit the Trust Ledger) for any of the following purposes (the order set forth below not constituting an order of priority for such withdrawals):



 (i)            to make remittances each month within two (2) Business Days of receipt from the Borrower (or such later time as set forth in the applicable Intercreditor Agreement) in an aggregate amount of immediately available funds equal to the allocable portion of the applicable Serviced Loan Combination Remittance Amount to (A) the related Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders in accordance with Section 3.05(h) and (B) the Collection Account for the benefit of the Trust in accordance with Section 4.06(ii) of this Agreement, in each case in accordance with the related Intercreditor Agreement provided that Liquidation Proceeds relating to the repurchase of any Serviced Companion Loan by the related seller thereof shall be remitted solely to the holder of such Serviced Companion Loan, as the case may be, and Liquidation Proceeds relating to the repurchase of a Mortgage Loan related to a Serviced Loan Combination by the related Mortgage Loan Seller shall be remitted solely to the Collection Account;

 (vi)         at such time as it reimburses the Trustee or itself, in that order, as applicable, for (A) any unreimbursed P&I Advance with respect to the applicable Mortgage Loan (including any such Advance that constitutes a Workout Delayed Reimbursement Amount) or any unreimbursed principal and/or interest advance with respect to the related Serviced Companion Loan pursuant to clause (iii) above, to pay itself, the Trustee or such Serviced Companion Loan Service Provider, as applicable, any Advance Interest Amounts accrued and payable thereon, (B) any unreimbursed Property Advances (including any such Advance that constitutes a Workout Delayed Reimbursement Amount) pursuant to clause (iv) above, to pay itself, the Special Servicer or the Trustee, as the case may be, any Advance Interest Amounts accrued and payable thereon or (C) any Nonrecoverable Advances pursuant to clause (v) above, to pay itself, the Special Servicer, the Trustee or any Serviced Companion Loan Service Provider, as the case may be, any Advance Interest Amounts accrued and payable thereon, with such amounts payable in the case of clauses (A), (B) and (C) above, first, from Penalty Charges pursuant to Section 3.12(d), and then, from collections on, and proceeds of on a pro rata basis as between the Mortgage Loan and any related other Serviced Companion Loans (based on the Mortgage Loan's Stated Principal Balance or related Serviced Companion Loan's principal balance), provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, such party's rights to reimbursement pursuant to this clause (vi) with respect to any such interest on P&I Advances (including any such P&I Advance that is a Nonrecoverable Advance or a Workout-Delayed Reimbursement Amount) being limited to amounts on deposit in the applicable Serviced Loan Combination Collection Account that were received in respect of the particular Mortgage Loan (as allocable thereto pursuant to the related Loan Documents and the related Intercreditor Agreement) in the related Serviced Loan Combination as to which such advance relates;

The Special Servicer shall keep and maintain separate accounting for each Specially Serviced Loan included in the Serviced Loan Combination and related REO Loan, on a loan by loan and property by property basis, for the purpose of justifying any request for withdrawal from any Serviced Loan Combination Collection Account.



 Any permitted withdrawals under this Section 3.06(b) with respect to reimbursement for advances or other amounts payable to an Other Trustee shall, if applicable, also be deemed to be a permitted withdrawal for similar amounts owed to the fiscal agent of the Other Trustee, if any.

 Any Loss of Value Payments transferred to the Collection Account pursuant to clauses (i)-(iii) of the prior paragraph shall be treated as Liquidation Proceeds received by the Trust in respect of the related Mortgage Loan or any successor REO Loan with respect thereto for which such Loss of Value Payments were received; and any Loss of Value Payments transferred to the Collection Account pursuant to clause (iv) of the prior paragraph shall be treated as Liquidation Proceeds received by the Trust in respect of the Mortgage Loan or REO Loan for which such Loss of Value Payments are being transferred to the Collection Account to cover an item contemplated by clauses (i)-(iv) of the prior paragraph.

 (x)           consistent with any notice required to be given thereunder, demand that payment thereon be made on the last day such Permitted Investment may otherwise mature hereunder in an amount equal to the lesser of (1) all amounts then payable thereunder and (2) the amount required to be withdrawn on such date; and



 (y)           demand payment of all amounts due thereunder promptly upon determination by the Master Servicer (or the Special Servicer or the Certificate Administrator, as applicable) that such Permitted Investment would not constitute a Permitted Investment in respect of funds thereafter on deposit in the related Investment Account.



 (b)           All income and gain realized from investment of funds deposited in any Investment Account shall be for the benefit of the Master Servicer (except with respect to the investment of funds deposited in (i) any Borrower Account, which shall be for the benefit of the related Borrower to the extent required under the related Loan Documents for the Mortgage Loan or applicable law, (ii) any REO Account and the Loss of Value Reserve Fund, which shall be for the benefit of the Special Servicer or (iii) the Excess Liquidation Proceeds Account, the Interest Reserve Account and the Distribution Accounts, which shall be for the benefit of the Certificate Administrator) and, if held in the Collection Account, any Serviced Loan Combination Collection Account, REO Account or Distribution Account shall be subject to withdrawal by the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer or the Certificate Administrator, as applicable, in accordance with Section 3.06 or Section 3.15(b) of this Agreement, as applicable.  The Master Servicer, or with respect to any REO Account or Loss of Value Reserve Fund, the Special Servicer, or with respect to the Excess Liquidation Proceeds Account, the Distribution Accounts, the Certificate Administrator, shall deposit from its own funds into the Collection Account, the applicable Serviced Loan Combination Collection Account, any REO Account or Loss of Value Reserve Fund, the Excess Liquidation Proceeds Account, the Interest Reserve Account or the Distribution Accounts, as applicable, the amount of any loss incurred in respect of any such Permitted Investment immediately upon realization of such loss; provided, that the Master







 Servicer, the Special Servicer or the Certificate Administrator, as applicable, may reduce the amount of such payment to the extent it forgoes any investment income in such Investment Account otherwise payable to it.  The Master Servicer shall also deposit from its own funds in any Borrower Account immediately upon realization of such loss the amount of any loss incurred in respect of Permitted Investments, except to the extent that amounts are invested at the direction of or for the benefit of the Borrower under the terms of the related Loan Documents for the Mortgage Loan, Serviced Loan Combination or applicable law; provided that neither the Master Servicer nor the Special Servicer shall be required to deposit any loss on an investment of funds in an Investment Account if such loss is incurred solely as a result of the insolvency of the federal or state chartered depository institution or trust company that holds such Investment Account, so long as such depository institution or trust company has satisfied the qualifications set forth in the definition of Eligible Account both (x) at the time the investment was made and (y) 30 days prior to such insolvency.



 (c)           Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, if any default occurs in the making of a payment due under any Permitted Investment, or if a default occurs in any other performance required under any Permitted Investment, in either case as a result of an action or inaction of the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer or the Certificate Administrator, as applicable, the Trustee may, and upon the request of Holders of Certificates entitled to a majority of the Voting Rights allocated to any Class shall, take such action as may be appropriate to enforce such payment or performance, including the institution and prosecution of appropriate proceedings.  If the Trustee takes any such action, (i) the Master Servicer, if such Permitted Investment was for the benefit of the Master Servicer, (ii) the Special Servicer, if such Permitted Investment was for the benefit of the Special Servicer or (iii) the Certificate Administrator, if such Permitted Investment was for the benefit of the Certificate Administrator, shall pay or reimburse the Trustee for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, disbursements and advances incurred or made by the Trustee in connection therewith.



 Section 3.08     Maintenance of Insurance Policies and Errors and Omissions and Fidelity Coverage.  (a)  In the case of each Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination, as applicable (but excluding any REO Loan and any Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan), the Master Servicer shall use commercially reasonable efforts consistent with the Servicing Standard to cause the related Borrower, with respect to the Mortgage Loans (other than a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan) and Serviced Loan Combinations that it is servicing, to maintain the following insurance coverage (including identifying the extent to which such Borrower is maintaining insurance coverage and, if such Borrower does not so maintain, the Master Servicer will itself cause to be maintained with Qualified Insurers) for the related Mortgaged Property:  (x) except where the Loan Documents permit a Borrower to rely on self-insurance provided by a tenant, a fire and casualty extended coverage insurance policy, which does not provide for reduction due to depreciation, in an amount that is at least equal to the lesser of (i) the full replacement cost of improvements securing such Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination, as applicable, and (ii) the Stated Principal Balance of such Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination, as applicable, but, in any event, in an amount sufficient to avoid the application of any co-insurance clause and (y) all other insurance coverage (including, but not limited to, coverage for acts of terrorism) that is required, subject to applicable law, under the related Loan Documents; provided, that:







 (i)            the Master Servicer shall not be required to maintain any earthquake or environmental insurance policy on any Mortgaged Property unless the Trustee has an insurable interest and (x) such insurance policy was in effect at the time of the origination of the related Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination, as applicable, or (y) such insurance policy was required by the related Loan Documents and is available at commercially reasonable rates, provided that the Master Servicer shall require the related Borrower to maintain such insurance in the amount, in the case of clause (x), maintained at origination, and in the case of clause (y), required by such Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination, in each case, to the extent such amounts are available at commercially reasonable rates and to the extent the Trustee has an insurable interest;



 (ii)           if and to the extent that any Loan Document grants the lender thereunder any discretion (by way of consent, approval or otherwise) as to the insurance provider from whom the related Borrower is to obtain the requisite insurance coverage, the Master Servicer shall (to the extent consistent with the Servicing Standard) require the related Borrower to obtain the requisite insurance coverage from Qualified Insurers;



 (iii)          the Master Servicer shall have no obligation beyond using its reasonable efforts consistent with the Servicing Standard to cause any Borrower to maintain the insurance required to be maintained under the Loan Documents; provided, that this clause shall not limit the Master Servicer's obligation to obtain and maintain a force-placed insurance policy, as provided herein;



 (iv)         except as provided below (including under clause (vi) below), in no event shall the Master Servicer be required to cause the Borrower to maintain, or itself obtain, insurance coverage to the extent that the failure of such Borrower to maintain insurance coverage is an Acceptable Insurance Default (as determined by the Special Servicer);



 (v)           to the extent that the Master Servicer itself is required to maintain insurance that the Borrower does not maintain, the Master Servicer will not be required to maintain insurance other than what is available to the Master Servicer on a force-placed basis at commercially reasonable rates, and only to the extent the Trust as lender has an insurable interest thereon; and



 (vi)         any explicit terrorism insurance requirements contained in the related Loan Documents shall be enforced by the Master Servicer in accordance with the Servicing Standard, unless the Special Servicer (and, if no Control Termination Event has occurred and is continuing, the Directing Holder) have consented to a waiver (including a waiver to permit the Master Servicer to accept insurance that does not comply with specific requirements contained in the Loan Documents) in writing of that provision in accordance with the Servicing Standard; provided that the Special Servicer shall promptly notify the Master Servicer in writing of such waiver.



 The Master Servicer shall notify the Special Servicer, the Certificate Administrator, the Trustee and the Directing Holder if the Master Servicer determines in accordance with the Servicing Standard that a Borrower under a Mortgage Loan (other than a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan) has failed to maintain insurance required under the Loan Documents and such failure materially and adversely affects the interests of the







 Certificateholders or if a Borrower under a Mortgage Loan (other than a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan) has notified the Master Servicer in writing that the Borrower does not intend to maintain such insurance and that the Master Servicer has determined in accordance with the Servicing Standard that such failure materially and adversely affects the interests of the Certificateholders.



 Subject to Section 3.15(b) of this Agreement, with respect to each Serviced REO Property, the Special Servicer shall use reasonable efforts and only if the Trustee has an insurable interest, consistent with the Servicing Standard, to maintain (subject to the right of the Special Servicer to direct the Master Servicer to make a Property Advance for the costs associated with coverage that the Special Servicer determines to maintain, in which case the Master Servicer shall make such Property Advance) with Qualified Insurers to the extent reasonably available at commercially reasonable rates and to the extent the Trustee has an insurable interest, (a) a fire and casualty extended coverage insurance policy, which does not provide for reduction due to depreciation, in an amount that is at least equal to the lesser of the full replacement value of the Mortgaged Property or the Stated Principal Balance of the Mortgage Loan, Serviced REO Loan or the Serviced Loan Combination, as applicable (or such greater amount of coverage required by the related Loan Documents (unless such amount is not available)), but, in any event, in an amount sufficient to avoid the application of any co-insurance clause, (b) a comprehensive general liability insurance policy with coverage comparable to that which would be required under prudent lending requirements and in an amount not less than $1.0 million per occurrence, and (c) to the extent consistent with the Servicing Standard, a business interruption or rental loss insurance covering revenues or rents for a period of at least 12 months; provided, that the Special Servicer shall not be required in any event to maintain or obtain insurance coverage described in this paragraph beyond what is reasonably available at a commercially reasonable rate and consistent with the Servicing Standard.



 All such insurance policies maintained as described above shall contain (if they insure against loss to property) a "standard" mortgagee clause, with loss payable to the Master Servicer (on behalf of the Trustee on behalf of Certificateholders and, with respect to a Serviced Loan Combination, the related Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders), or shall name the Trustee as the insured, with loss payable to the Special Servicer on behalf of the Trustee (on behalf of Certificateholders and, with respect to a Serviced Loan Combination, the related Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders) (in the case of insurance maintained in respect of an REO Property).  Any amounts collected by the Master Servicer or Special Servicer, as applicable, under any such policies (other than amounts to be applied to the restoration or repair of the related Mortgaged Property or Serviced REO Property or amounts to be released to the related Borrower, in each case in accordance with the Servicing Standard) shall be deposited in the Collection Account (or, in the case of the Serviced Loan Combinations, in the applicable Serviced Loan Combination Collection Account), subject to withdrawal pursuant to Section 3.06 of this Agreement, in the case of amounts received in respect of a Mortgage Loan (other than a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan) or Serviced Loan Combination, or in the applicable REO Account of the Special Servicer, subject to withdrawal pursuant to Section 3.15 of this Agreement, in the case of amounts received in respect of a Serviced REO Property.  Any cost incurred by the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer in maintaining any such insurance shall not, for purposes hereof, including calculating monthly distributions to Certificateholders or Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders, be added to the Stated Principal Balance of the related Mortgage Loan or the Serviced Loan Combination, notwithstanding that the terms of such







 Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination so permit; provided, that this sentence shall not limit the rights of the Master Servicer or Special Servicer on behalf of the Trust Fund to enforce any obligations of the related Borrower under such Mortgage Loan (other than a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan) or Serviced Loan Combination.  Any costs incurred by the Master Servicer in maintaining any such insurance policies in respect of the Mortgage Loans or Specially Serviced Loans (other than REO Properties) (i) if the Borrower defaults on its obligation to do so, shall be advanced by the Master Servicer as a Property Advance and will be charged to the related Borrower and (ii) shall not, for purposes of calculating monthly distributions to Certificateholders, be added to the Stated Principal Balance of the related Mortgage Loan, notwithstanding that the terms of such Mortgage Loan so permit.  Any cost incurred by the Special Servicer in maintaining any such Insurance Policies with respect to Serviced REO Properties shall be an expense of the Trust Fund (and in the case of any Serviced Loan Combination, such expense shall be allocated in accordance with the allocation provisions of the related Intercreditor Agreement) payable out of the related REO Account (or Serviced Loan Combination REO Account, as applicable) or, if the amount on deposit therein is insufficient therefor, advanced by the Master Servicer as a Property Advance (or paid from the Collection Account if the Master Servicer determines such Advance would be a Nonrecoverable Advance, subject to Section 3.21(d) of this Agreement).



 (b)           If either:



 (x) the Master Servicer or Special Servicer obtains and maintains, or causes to be obtained and maintained, a blanket policy or master force-placed policy insuring against hazard losses on all of the Mortgage Loans (other than Non-Serviced Mortgage Loans), Serviced Loan Combinations  or the Serviced REO Properties, as applicable, then, to the extent such policy



 (i)       is obtained from a Qualified Insurer, and



 (ii)       provides protection equivalent to the individual policies otherwise required, or



 (y) the Master Servicer or Special Servicer (or Midland Loan Services, a Division of PNC Bank, National Association as primary servicer for the Miracle Mile Shops Mortgage Loan under the Midland Primary Servicing Agreement) or, in each case, its corporate parent, has long-term unsecured debt obligations that are rated not lower than ''A-'' by Fitch, "A2" by Moody's and no lower than its equivalent by KBRA (if then rated by KBRA), and the Master Servicer or Special Servicer (or Midland Loan Services, a Division of PNC Bank, National Association as primary servicer for the Miracle Mile Shops Mortgage Loan under the Midland Primary Servicing Agreement) self-insures for its obligation to maintain the individual policies otherwise required,



 then the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer shall conclusively be deemed to have satisfied its obligation to cause hazard insurance to be maintained on the related Mortgaged Properties or Serviced REO Properties, as applicable.



 Such a blanket or master force-placed policy may contain a deductible clause (not in excess of a customary amount), in which case the Master Servicer or Special Servicer, as the case may be,







 that maintains such policy shall, if there shall not have been maintained on any Mortgaged Property securing a Mortgage Loan (other than a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan) or Serviced REO Property thereunder a hazard insurance policy complying with the requirements of Section 3.08(a) of this Agreement, and there shall have been one or more losses that would have been covered by such an individual policy, promptly deposit into the Collection Account (or, in the case of a Serviced Loan Combination, in the related Serviced Loan Combination Collection Account), from its own funds, the amount not otherwise payable under the blanket or master force-placed policy in connection with such loss or losses because of such deductible clause to the extent that any such deductible exceeds the deductible limitation that pertained to the related Mortgage Loan or the related Serviced Loan Combination, as applicable (or, in the absence of any such deductible limitation, the deductible limitation for an individual policy which is consistent with the Servicing Standard).  The Master Servicer and Special Servicer shall prepare and present, on behalf of itself, the Trustee, Certificateholders and, if applicable the Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders, claims under any such blanket or master force-placed policy maintained by it in a timely fashion in accordance with the terms of such policy.  If the Master Servicer or Special Servicer, as applicable, causes any Mortgaged Property securing a Mortgage Loan (other than a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan) or Serviced REO Property to be covered by such "force-placed" insurance policy, the incremental costs of such insurance applicable to such Mortgaged Property or Serviced REO Property (ixxPDexxPD, other than any minimum or standby premium payable for such policy whether or not any Mortgaged Property or Serviced REO Property is covered thereby) shall be paid as a Property Advance.



 (c)           With respect to each Mortgage Loan (other than any Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan) or Serviced Loan Combination, as applicable, that is subject to an Environmental Insurance Policy, if the Master Servicer has actual knowledge of any event giving rise to a claim under an Environmental Insurance Policy, the Master Servicer shall notify the Special Servicer to such effect and the Master Servicer shall take reasonable actions as are in accordance with the Servicing Standard and the terms and conditions of such Environmental Insurance Policy to make a claim thereunder and achieve the payment of all amounts to which the Trust is entitled thereunder.  With respect to each Specially Serviced Loan and Serviced REO Property that is subject to an Environmental Insurance Policy, if the Special Servicer has actual knowledge of any event giving rise to a claim under an Environmental Insurance Policy, such Special Servicer shall take reasonable actions as are in accordance with the Servicing Standard and the terms and conditions of such Environmental Insurance Policy to make a claim thereunder and achieve the payment of all amounts to which the Trust, on behalf of the Certificateholders and, if applicable, the Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders, is entitled thereunder.  Any legal fees or other out-of-pocket costs incurred in accordance with the Servicing Standard in connection with any claim under an Environmental Insurance Policy described above (whether by the Master Servicer or Special Servicer) shall be paid by, and reimbursable to, the Master Servicer as a Property Advance.



 (d)           The Master Servicer and Special Servicer shall at all times during the term of this Agreement (or, in the case of the Special Servicer, at all times during the term of this Agreement during which Specially Serviced Loans and/or Serviced REO Properties as to which it is the Special Servicer are included in the Trust Fund) keep in force with a Qualified Insurer, a fidelity bond in such form and amount as are consistent with the Servicing Standard.  The Master Servicer or Special Servicer, as applicable, shall be deemed to have complied with the foregoing







 provision if an Affiliate thereof has such fidelity bond coverage and, by the terms of such fidelity bond, the coverage afforded thereunder extends to the Master Servicer or Special Servicer, as the case may be.  Such fidelity bond shall provide that it may not be canceled without ten days' prior written notice to the Trustee.  So long as the long-term unsecured debt obligations of the Master Servicer (or its corporate parent if such insurance is guaranteed by its parent) or the Special Servicer (or its corporate parent), as applicable, are rated not lower than  "A-" by Fitch, "A2" by Moody's and no lower than its equivalent by KBRA (if then rated by KBRA), the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as applicable, may self-insure with respect to the fidelity bond coverage required as described above, in which case it shall not be required to maintain an insurance policy with respect to such coverage.



 The Master Servicer and Special Servicer, as applicable, shall at all times during the term of this Agreement (or, in the case of the Special Servicer, at all times during the term of this Agreement during which Specially Serviced Loans and/or Serviced REO Properties exist as part of the Trust Fund) also keep in force with a Qualified Insurer a policy or policies of insurance covering loss occasioned by the errors and omissions of its officers and employees in connection with their servicing obligations hereunder, which policy or policies shall be in such form and amount as are consistent with the Servicing Standard.  The Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as applicable, shall be deemed to have complied with the foregoing provisions if an Affiliate thereof has such insurance and, by the terms of such policy or policies, the coverage afforded thereunder extends to the Master Servicer or Special Servicer, as the case may be.  Any such errors and omissions policy shall provide that it may not be canceled without ten days' prior written notice to the Trustee.  So long as the long-term unsecured debt obligations of the Master Servicer (or its corporate parent if such insurance is guaranteed by its parent) or the Special Servicer (or its corporate parent), as applicable, are rated not lower than  "A-" by Fitch, "A2" by Moody's and no lower than its equivalent by KBRA (if then rated by KBRA), the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as applicable, may self-insure with respect to the errors and omissions coverage required as described above, in which case it shall not be required to maintain an insurance policy with respect to such coverage.



 Section 3.09     Enforcement of Due-on-Sale Clauses; Assumption Agreements; Defeasance Provisions.  (a)  If any Mortgage Loan (other than a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan) or Serviced Loan Combination contains a provision in the nature of a "due-on-sale" clause (including, without limitation, sales or transfers of Mortgaged Properties (in full or part) or the sale, transfer, pledge or hypothecation of direct or indirect interests in the Borrower or its owners), which by its terms:



 (i)       provides that such Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination will (or may at the mortgagee's option) become due and payable upon the sale or other transfer of an interest in the related Mortgaged Property (including, without limitation, the sale, transfer, pledge or hypothecation of direct or indirect interests in the Borrower or its owners),



 (ii)       provides that such Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination may not be assumed without the consent of the related mortgagee in connection with any such sale or other transfer, or







 (iii)       provides that such Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination may be assumed or transferred without the consent of the mortgagee, provided certain conditions set forth in the Loan Documents are satisfied,



 then, for so long as such Mortgage Loan (other than a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan) or Serviced Loan Combination (or related Mortgage Loan) is included in the Trust Fund, subject to the rights of the Directing Holder, the Special Servicer, on behalf of the Trust Fund, shall not be required to enforce any such due-on-sale clauses and in connection therewith shall not be required to (x) accelerate payments thereon or (y) withhold its consent to such an assumption if (1) such provision is not exercisable under applicable law or if the Special Servicer determines, subject to the rights of the Directing Holder, that the enforcement of such provision is reasonably likely to result in meritorious legal action by the Borrower or (2) the Special Servicer determines, in accordance with the Servicing Standard and subject to the rights of the Directing Holder, that granting such consent would be likely to result in a greater recovery, on a present value basis (discounting at the related Calculation Rate), than would enforcement of such clause.  The Special Servicer shall be responsible for determining whether (i) to enforce any such due-on-sale clauses or (ii) to provide its consent to such an assumption, and for the handling of all related processing and documentation, or, if mutually agreed to by the Master Servicer and the Special Servicer, the Master Servicer shall be required to process such request subject to the consent of the Special Servicer.  If the Special Servicer determines that (A) granting such consent would be likely to result in a greater recovery, (B) such provision is not legally enforceable, or (C) that the conditions described in clause (a)(iii) above relating to the assumption or transfer of a related Mortgage Loan (other than a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan) or Serviced Loan Combination have been satisfied, the Special Servicer is authorized to take or enter into an assumption agreement from or with the Person to whom the related Mortgaged Property has been or is about to be conveyed, and to release the original Borrower from liability upon such Mortgage Loan and substitute the new Borrower as obligor thereon, provided that (a) the credit status of the prospective new Borrower is in compliance with the Master Servicer's or the Special Servicer's servicing standards and criteria and the terms of the related Mortgage and (b) the Special Servicer has followed the No Downgrade Confirmation process pursuant to Section 3.30 relating to the Certificates and Serviced Companion Loan Securities, if any, with respect to Moody's in the case of any such Mortgage Loan or group of cross-collateralized Mortgage Loans that represents one of the ten largest Mortgage Loans or groups of cross-collateralized Mortgage Loans based on Stated Principal Balance.  In addition, with respect to the Serviced Companion Loan, the Special Servicer may not waive any rights under a due on sale clause unless it first obtains a No Downgrade Confirmation with respect to the related Serviced Companion Loan Securities.  In connection with each such assumption or substitution entered into by the Special Servicer, the Special Servicer shall give prior notice thereof to the Master Servicer.  The Special Servicer shall notify the Trustee, the Master Servicer, the Certificate Administrator and the Directing Holder that any such assumption or substitution agreement has been completed by forwarding to the Custodian (with a copy to the Master Servicer, the Certificate Administrator, the Trustee and the Directing Holder, as applicable) the original copy of such agreement, which copies shall be added to the related Mortgage File and shall, for all purposes, be considered a part of such Mortgage File to the same extent as all other documents and instruments constituting a part thereof.  To the extent not precluded by the Loan Documents, the Special Servicer shall not approve an assumption or substitution without requiring the related Borrower to pay any fees owed to the Rating Agencies associated with the approval of such assumption or substitution.







 However, in the event that the related Borrower is required but fails to pay such fees, such fees shall be an expense of the Trust Fund, provided that the Special Servicer, or the Master Servicer at the direction of the Special Servicer, shall be required, after receiving payment from amounts on deposit in the Collection Account, if any, to (i) promptly notify the holder of the related Companion Loan and (ii) use commercially reasonable efforts to exercise on behalf of the Trust Fund the rights of the Trust Fund under the related Intercreditor Agreement to obtain reimbursement for a pro rata portion of such amount allocable to the related Serviced Companion Loans from the holders of such Serviced Companion Loans.



 (b)           If any Mortgage Loan (other than a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan) or Serviced Loan Combination contains a provision in the nature of a "due-on-encumbrance" clause, which by its terms:



 (i)           provides that such Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination shall (or may at the mortgagee's option) become due and payable upon the creation of any lien or other encumbrance on the related Mortgaged Property or any direct or indirect ownership interest in the borrower (including, unless specifically permitted, any mezzanine financing of the Borrower or the Mortgaged Property or any sale or transfer of preferred equity in the Borrower or its owners),



 (ii)          requires the consent of the related mortgagee to the creation of any such lien or other encumbrance on the related Mortgaged Property (including, without limitation, any mezzanine financing of the Borrower or the Mortgaged Property or any sale or transfer of preferred equity in the Borrower or its owners), or



 (iii)          provides that such Mortgaged Property may be further encumbered without the consent of the mortgagee (including, without limitation, any mezzanine financing of the Borrower or the Mortgaged Property or any sale or transfer of preferred equity in the Borrower or its owners), provided certain conditions set forth in the Loan Documents are satisfied,



 then, the Special Servicer, on behalf of the Trust Fund, shall not be required to enforce such due-on-encumbrance clauses and in connection therewith, will not be required to (i) accelerate the payments on the related Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination or (ii) withhold its consent to such lien or encumbrance, if the Special Servicer subject to the rights of the Directing Holder, (x) determines, in accordance with the Servicing Standard that such enforcement would not be in the best interests of the Trust Fund or the holder of the related Serviced Companion Loan, if applicable, or that in the case of a Mortgage Loan (other than a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan) or Serviced Loan Combination described in clause (b)(iii) above that the conditions to further encumbrance have been satisfied and (y) as to any Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination, follows the No Downgrade Confirmation procedure pursuant to Section 3.30 with respect to Moody's in the case of any such Mortgage Loan that represents one of the ten largest Mortgage Loans or groups of cross-collateralized Mortgage Loans based on Stated Principal Balance.  In addition, with respect to each Serviced Companion Loan, the Special Servicer shall not waive any rights under a due-on-encumbrance clause unless it first obtains a No Downgrade Confirmation with respect to the related Serviced Companion Loan Securities.  To the extent not precluded by the Loan Documents, the Special Servicer shall not approve an assumption or substitution without requiring the related Borrower to pay any fees owed to the Rating Agencies







 associated with the approval of such lien or encumbrance.  However, in the event that the related Borrower is required but fails to pay such fees, such fees shall be an expense of the Trust Fund, provided that the Special Servicer, or the Master Servicer at the direction of the Special Servicer, shall be required, after receiving payment from amounts on deposit in the Collection Account, if any, to (i) promptly notify the holder of the related Companion Loan and (ii) use commercially reasonable efforts to exercise on behalf of the Trust Fund the rights of the Trust Fund under the related Intercreditor Agreement to obtain reimbursement for a pro rata portion of such amount allocable to the related Serviced Companion Loans from the holders of such Serviced Companion Loans.  The Special Servicer shall be responsible for determining whether (i) to enforce any such due-on-encumbrance clauses or (ii) to provide its consent to such a lien or due-on-encumbrance, and for the handling of all related processing and documentation or, if mutually agreed to by the Master Servicer and the Special Servicer, the Master Servicer shall be required to process such request subject to the consent of the Special Servicer.



 (c)           Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Special Servicer may not waive its rights or grant its consent under any "due-on-sale" or "due-on-encumbrance" clause relating to any Specially Serviced Loan without, if no Control Termination Event has occurred and is continuing, the consent of the Directing Holder.  The Directing Holder shall have 10 Business Days (or longer period provided by the related Intercreditor Agreement) after receipt of notice along with the Special Servicer's recommendation and analysis with respect to such waiver and any additional information the Directing Holder may reasonably request from the Special Servicer of a proposed waiver or consent under any "due-on-sale" or "due-on-encumbrance" clause in which to grant or withhold its consent (provided that if the Special Servicer fails to receive a response to such notice from the Directing Holder in writing within such period, then the Directing Holder shall be deemed to have consented to such proposed waiver or consent).



 (d)           The Master Servicer and the Special Servicer, as applicable, shall provide copies of any waivers it effects pursuant to Section 3.09(a) or (b) of this Agreement to the other party, the 17g-5 Information Provider (who shall promptly post such waivers to the 17g-5 Information Provider's Website pursuant to Section 3.14(d) of this Agreement) and the related Other 17g-5 Information Provider (if applicable) with respect to each Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination.



 (e)           Nothing in this Section 3.09 shall constitute a waiver of the Trustee's right, as the mortgagee of record, to receive notice of any assumption of a Mortgage Loan, any sale or other transfer of the related Mortgaged Property or the creation of any lien or other encumbrance with respect to such Mortgaged Property.



 (f)           In connection with the taking of, or the failure to take, any action pursuant to this Section 3.09, the Special Servicer shall not agree to modify, waive or amend, and no assumption or substitution agreement entered into pursuant to Section 3.09(a) of this Agreement shall contain any terms that are different from, any term of any Mortgage Loan (other than a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan) or Serviced Loan Combination or the related Note, other than pursuant to Section 3.26 hereof, as applicable.







 (g)           With respect to any Mortgage Loan (other than a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan) or Serviced Loan Combination which permits release of Mortgaged Properties through defeasance:



 (i)           If such Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination requires that the lender purchase the required government securities, then the Master Servicer shall purchase, or shall cause the purchase of, such obligations on behalf of the Trust, at the related Borrower's expense, in accordance with the terms of such Mortgage Loan; provided that the Master Servicer shall not accept the amounts paid by the related Borrower to effect defeasance until acceptable government securities have been identified.



 (ii)          To the extent not inconsistent with such Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination, the Master Servicer shall require the related Borrower to provide an Opinion of Counsel (which shall be an expense of the related Borrower) to the effect that the Trustee has a first priority perfected security interest in the defeasance collateral (including the government securities) and the assignment of the defeasance collateral is valid and enforceable; such opinion, together with any other certificates or documents to be required in connection with such defeasance shall be in form and substance acceptable to each Rating Agency.



 (iii)         To the extent not inconsistent with such Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination, the Master Servicer shall require a certificate at the related Borrower's expense from an Independent certified public accountant certifying to the effect that the government securities will provide cash flows sufficient to meet all payments of interest and principal (including payments at maturity) on such Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination in compliance with the requirements of the terms of the related Loan Documents.



 (iv)         Prior to permitting the release of any Mortgaged Property through defeasance, the Master Servicer shall obtain, at the related Borrower's expense, a No Downgrade Confirmation; provided, the Master Servicer shall not be required to obtain such No Downgrade Confirmation from Moody's unless such Mortgage Loan at the time of such defeasance is (x) a Mortgage Loan that is one of the ten largest Mortgage Loans by Stated Principal Balance, (y) a Mortgage Loan with a Stated Principal Balance equal to or greater than $20,000,000 or (z) a Mortgage Loan that represents 5% or more of the Stated Principal Balance of all Mortgage Loans.



 (v)          Prior to permitting release of any Mortgaged Property through defeasance, the Master Servicer shall require an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such release will not cause either Trust REMIC to fail to qualify as a REMIC at any time that any Certificates are outstanding or cause a tax to be imposed on the Trust Fund under the REMIC Provisions; provided that to the extent not inconsistent with the Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination, the related Borrower shall pay the cost related to the Opinion of Counsel (and shall otherwise be a Servicing Advance).







 (vi)         No defeasance shall occur on or prior to the second anniversary of the Startup Day of the Trust REMICs, or in the case of any Companion Loan, the second anniversary of the startup day of any REMIC holding such Companion Loan.



 (vii)        The Trustee shall at the expense of the related Borrower (to the extent not inconsistent with the related Loan Documents) hold the UxxPDSxxPD government securities as pledgee for the benefit of the Certificateholders and, if applicable, the Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders, and the Certificate Administrator shall apply payments of principal and interest received on the government obligations to the Collection Account in respect of the defeased Mortgage Loan according to the payment schedule existing immediately prior to the defeasance.



 (viii)       The Master Servicer shall, in accordance with the Servicing Standard, enforce provisions in the Mortgage Loans that it is servicing requiring Borrowers to pay all reasonable expenses associated with a defeasance.



 (ix)          To the extent not inconsistent with such Mortgage Loan, or to the extent the related Loan Documents provide the lender with discretion, the Master Servicer shall require a single purpose entity, formed solely for the purpose of owning and pledging the government securities related to one or more of the Mortgage Loans, to act as a successor borrower.



 (x)           The Master Servicer may accept as defeasance collateral of any "government security," within the meaning of Treasury Regulation's Section 1.860G-(2)(a)(8)(ii), notwithstanding any more restrictive requirements in the Loan Documents; provided, that the Master Servicer has received an Opinion of Counsel that acceptance of such defeasance collateral will not cause an Adverse REMIC Event.



 (xi)          Neither the Master Servicer nor the Special Servicer shall charge a fee for defeasance in excess of that permitted under the Loan Documents in the event that the Loan Documents provide for such a fee limitation.



 (h)           Subject to Section 3.23(e) of this Agreement, with respect to all Specially Serviced Loans and Performing Loans, the Special Servicer shall, prior to waiving its rights or granting its consent to any proposed action of the Master Servicer under this Section 3.09, and prior to itself taking such an action, obtain the written consent of the Directing Holder, which consent shall be deemed given 10 Business Days (or such longer period if necessary for a Serviced Loan Combination pursuant to the terms of the related Intercreditor Agreement) after receipt (unless earlier objected to) by the Directing Holder of the Master Servicer's and/or Special Servicer's, as applicable, written analysis and recommendation with respect to such action together with such other information reasonably required by the Directing Holder.  When the Special Servicer's consent is requested under this Section 3.09, such consent shall be deemed given 15 Business Days (or such longer time period pursuant to the terms of the related Intercreditor Agreement but not less than five (5) Business Days after the time period set forth therein for Directing Holder approval) after receipt (unless earlier objected to) by the Special Servicer from the Master Servicer of the Master Servicer's written analysis and recommendation with respect to such proposed action together with such other information reasonably required by the Special Servicer.







 Section 3.10     Appraisals; Realization upon Defaulted Mortgage Loans. (a)  Other than with respect to a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan, contemporaneously with the earliest of (i) the effective date of any (A) modification of the Maturity Date or extended Maturity Date, a Mortgage Rate, principal balance or amortization terms of any Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination or any other term of a Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination, (B) extension of the Maturity Date or extended Maturity Date of a Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination as described below in Section 3.26 of this Agreement, or (C) consent to the release of any Mortgaged Property from the lien of the related Mortgage other than pursuant to the terms of the related Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination, (ii) the occurrence of an Appraisal Reduction Event, (iii) a default in the payment of a Balloon Payment for which an extension is not granted, or (iv) the date on which the Special Servicer, consistent with the Servicing Standard, requests an Updated Valuation, the Special Servicer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain an Updated Valuation (or a letter update for an existing appraisal which is less than two years old) within 60 days of such request, the cost of which shall constitute a Property Advance; provided, that the Special Servicer shall not be required to obtain an Updated Valuation pursuant to clauses (i) through (iv) above with respect to any Mortgaged Property for which there exists an Appraisal, Updated Appraisal or Small Loan Appraisal Estimate which is less than nine months old unless the Special Servicer has actual knowledge of a material adverse change in circumstances that, consistent with the Servicing Standard, would call into question the validity of such Appraisal, Updated Appraisal or Small Loan Appraisal Estimate.  For so long as such Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination is a Specially Serviced Loan, the Special Servicer shall obtain letter updates to each Updated Valuation every nine months, and the Master Servicer shall recalculate the Appraisal Reduction Amount prior to the Special Servicer granting extensions beyond one year or any subsequent extension after granting a one year extension with respect to the same Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination.  Subject to any required consent from the Directing Holder, nothing herein is intended to limit the Special Servicer's ability to pursue multiple strategies contemporaneously if the Special Servicer deems such actions appropriate under the Servicing Standard.  The Special Servicer shall update, every nine months, each Small Loan Appraisal Estimate or Updated Appraisal for so long as an Appraisal Reduction Event exists with respect to the related Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination and the Master Servicer shall recalculate the Appraisal Reduction Amount based on such updated Small Loan Appraisal Estimate or Updated Appraisal.  The Special Servicer shall send all such letter updates and Updated Valuations to the Master Servicer, the 17g-5 Information Provider (who shall promptly post such materials to the 17g-5 Information Provider's Website pursuant to Section 3.14(d) of this Agreement), the related Serviced Companion Loan Noteholder (if any) and, for so long as no Consultation Termination Event has occurred and is continuing, the Directing Holder.



 The Special Servicer shall monitor each Specially Serviced Loan, evaluate whether the causes of the default can be corrected over a reasonable period without significant impairment of the value of the related Mortgaged Property, initiate corrective action in cooperation with the Borrower if, in the Special Servicer's judgment, cure is likely, and take such other actions (including without limitation, negotiating and accepting a discounted payoff of a Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination) as are consistent with the Servicing Standard.  If, in the Special Servicer's judgment, such corrective action has been unsuccessful, no satisfactory arrangement can be made for collection of delinquent payments, and the Specially Serviced Loan has not been released from the Trust Fund pursuant to any provision hereof, and







 except as otherwise specifically provided in Section 3.09(a) and 3.09(b) of this Agreement, the Special Servicer may, to the extent consistent with the Asset Status Report (and with the consent of the Directing Holder if no Control Termination Event has occurred and is continuing) and with the Servicing Standard, accelerate such Specially Serviced Loan and commence a foreclosure or other acquisition with respect to the related Mortgaged Property or Properties, provided that the Special Servicer determines that such acceleration and foreclosure are more likely to produce a greater recovery to Certificateholders and, if applicable, Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders (as a collective whole as if such Certificateholders and, if applicable, Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders constituted a single lender) on a present value basis (discounting at the related Calculation Rate) than would a waiver of such default or an extension or modification in accordance with the provisions of Section 3.26 hereof.  In connection with causing the Trust to foreclose on collateral that consists of multiple properties held for sale to customers by the related Borrower (such as unsold condominium units in a single project), the Special Servicer directing such foreclosure shall consider the effect of the bidding price for the properties on the tax basis of such properties if such properties are likely to be treated in the hands of the Trust as properties held for sale to customers.  The Master Servicer shall pay the costs and expenses in any such proceedings as a Property Advance unless the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as applicable, determines, in its good faith judgment, that such Property Advance would constitute a Nonrecoverable Advance; provided, if such Property Advance would constitute a Nonrecoverable Advance but the Special Servicer determines that such payment would be in best interests of the Certificateholders and, if applicable, Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders as a collective whole (as if such Certificateholders and (with respect to a Serviced Loan Combination) Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders constituted a single lender) (with the Master Servicer permitted to conclusively rely upon any such determination by the Special Servicer), the Special Servicer shall direct the Master Servicer to make such payment from the Collection Account (or, if applicable, the applicable Serviced Loan Combination Collection Account), which payment shall be an Additional Trust Fund Expense.  The Trustee shall be entitled to conclusively rely upon any determination of the Master Servicer or Special Servicer that a Property Advance, if made, would constitute a Nonrecoverable Advance.  If the Master Servicer does not make such Property Advance in violation of the second preceding sentence, the Trustee shall make such Property Advance, unless the Trustee determines that such Property Advance would be a Nonrecoverable Advance.  The Master Servicer and the Trustee, as applicable, shall be entitled to reimbursement of Property Advances (with interest at the Advance Rate) made pursuant to this paragraph to the extent permitted by Section 3.06 of this Agreement.



 (b)           If the Special Servicer elects to proceed with a non-judicial foreclosure in accordance with the laws of the state where the Mortgaged Property is located, the Special Servicer shall not be required to pursue a deficiency judgment against the related Borrower or any other liable party if (i) the laws of the state do not permit such a deficiency judgment after a non-judicial foreclosure or (ii) if the Special Servicer determines, in its best judgment, that the likely recovery if a deficiency judgment is obtained will not be sufficient to warrant the cost, time, expense and/or exposure of pursuing the deficiency judgment and such determination is evidenced by an Officer's Certificate delivered to the Trustee and the Certificate Administrator.



 (c)           In the event that title to any Mortgaged Property is acquired in foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure, the deed or certificate of sale shall be issued to the Trustee (on







 behalf of the Trust Fund), or to its nominee (which shall not include the Special Servicer) or a separate Trustee or co-Trustee on behalf of the Trustee as Holder of the Lower-Tier Regular Interests and the Class EC Regular Interests and the Certificateholders and, if applicable, the Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders.  Notwithstanding any such acquisition of title and cancellation of the related Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination, as applicable, such Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination, as applicable, shall (except for purposes of Section 9.01 of this Agreement) be considered to be a Serviced REO Loan until such time as the related Serviced REO Property shall be sold by the Trust Fund and shall be reduced only by collections net of expenses.  Consistent with the foregoing, for purposes of all calculations hereunder, so long as such Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination, as applicable, shall be considered to be an outstanding Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination, as applicable:



 (i)           it shall be assumed that, notwithstanding that the indebtedness evidenced by the related Note shall have been discharged, such Note and, for purposes of determining the Stated Principal Balance thereof, the related amortization schedule in effect at the time of any such acquisition of title shall remain in effect; and



 (ii)          subject to Section 1.02(g) of this Agreement, Net REO Proceeds received in any month shall be applied to amounts that would have been payable under the related Note(s) in accordance with the terms of such Note(s) and any applicable Intercreditor Agreement.  In the absence of such terms, Net REO Proceeds shall, subject to Section 1.02(g) of this Agreement, be deemed to have been received first, in payment of the accrued interest that remained unpaid on the date that the related Serviced REO Property was acquired by the Trust Fund; second, in respect of the delinquent principal installments that remained unpaid on such date; and thereafter, Net REO Proceeds received in any month shall be applied to the payment of installments of principal and accrued interest on such Mortgage Loan or Serviced Companion Loan, as applicable, deemed to be due and payable in accordance with the terms of such Note(s) and such amortization schedule until such principal has been paid in full and then to other amounts due under such Mortgage Loan or Serviced Companion Loan, as applicable,.  If such Net REO Proceeds exceed the Monthly Payment then payable, the excess shall be treated as a Principal Prepayment received in respect of such Mortgage Loan or Serviced Companion Loan, as applicable.



 (d)           Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, the Special Servicer shall not acquire for the benefit of the Trust Fund any personal property pursuant to this Section 3.10 unless either:



 (i)           such personal property is incident to real property (within the meaning of Section 856(e)(l) of the Code) so acquired by the Special Servicer for the benefit of the Trust Fund; or



 (ii)          the Special Servicer shall have requested and received an Opinion of Counsel (which opinion shall be an expense of the Lower-Tier REMIC) to the effect that the holding of such personal property by the Lower-Tier REMIC will not cause the imposition of a tax on either Trust REMIC under the REMIC Provisions or cause either Trust REMIC to fail to qualify as a REMIC at any time that any Certificate is outstanding.







 (e)           Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this Agreement, the Special Servicer shall not, on behalf of the Trust Fund, obtain title to any direct or indirect partnership interest or other equity interest in any Borrower pledged pursuant to any pledge agreement unless the Special Servicer shall have requested and received an Opinion of Counsel (which opinion shall be an expense of the Trust Fund (and in the case of any Serviced Loan Combination, such expense shall be allocated in accordance with the allocation provisions of the related Intercreditor Agreement)) to the effect that the holding of such partnership interest or other equity interest by the Trust Fund will not cause the imposition of a tax on either Trust REMIC under the REMIC Provisions or cause either Trust REMIC to fail to qualify as a REMIC at any time that any Certificate is outstanding.



 (f)           Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Special Servicer shall not cause the Trustee, on behalf of the Trust Fund, to obtain title to a Mortgaged Property as a result of or in lieu of foreclosure or otherwise, to obtain title to any direct or indirect partnership interest in any Borrower pledged pursuant to a pledge agreement and thereby be the beneficial owner of a Mortgaged Property, have a receiver of rents appointed with respect to, and shall not otherwise cause the Trustee to acquire possession of, or take any other action with respect to, any Mortgaged Property if, as a result of any such action, the Trustee, for the Trust Fund, the Certificateholders or Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders, if applicable, would be considered to hold title to, to be a "mortgagee-in-possession" of, or to be an "owner" or "operator" of such Mortgaged Property within the meaning of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended from time to time, or any comparable law, unless the Special Servicer has previously determined in accordance with the Servicing Standard, based on an updated environmental assessment report prepared by an Independent Person who regularly conducts environmental audits, that:



 (i)           such Mortgaged Property is in compliance with applicable environmental laws or, if not, after consultation with an environmental consultant, that it would be in the best economic interest of the Trust Fund (and with respect to the Serviced Loan Combinations, the Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders), as a collective whole as if such Certificateholders and, if applicable, Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders constituted a single lender, to take such actions as are necessary to bring such Mortgaged Property in compliance therewith, and



 (ii)           there are no circumstances present at such Mortgaged Property relating to the use, management or disposal of any Hazardous Materials for which investigation, testing, monitoring, containment, clean-up or remediation could be required under any currently effective federal, state or local law or regulation, or that, if any such Hazardous Materials are present for which such action could be required, after consultation with an environmental consultant, it would be in the best economic interest of the Trust Fund to take such actions with respect to the affected Mortgaged Property.



 In the event that the environmental assessment first obtained by the Special Servicer with respect to a Mortgaged Property indicates that such Mortgaged Property may not be in compliance with applicable environmental laws or that Hazardous Materials may be present but does not definitively establish such fact, the Special Servicer shall cause such further environmental tests to be conducted by an Independent Person who regularly conducts such tests as the Special Servicer shall deem prudent to protect the interests of Certificateholders and, if







 applicable, the Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders.  Any such tests shall be deemed part of the environmental assessment obtained by the Special Servicer for purposes of this Section 3.10.



 (g)           The environmental assessment contemplated by Section 3.10(f) of this Agreement shall be prepared within three months (or as soon thereafter as practicable) of the determination that such assessment is required by any Independent Person who regularly conducts environmental audits for purchasers of commercial property where the Mortgaged Property is located, as determined by the Special Servicer in a manner consistent with the Servicing Standard.  Upon the written direction of the Special Servicer and delivery by the Special Servicer to the Master Servicer of pertinent back-up information the Master Servicer shall advance the cost of preparation of such environmental assessments as a Property Advance unless the Master Servicer determines, in its good faith judgment, that such Property Advance would be a Nonrecoverable Advance.  The Master Servicer shall be entitled to reimbursement of Property Advances (with interest at the Advance Rate) made pursuant to the preceding sentence to the extent permitted by Section 3.06.  The Special Servicer shall provide written reports and a copy of any environmental assessments in electronic format to the Directing Holder (if no Consultation Termination Event has occurred and is continuing), the Master Servicer, the related Serviced Companion Loan Noteholder (if any) and the 17g-5 Information Provider (who shall promptly post such materials to the 17g-5 Information Provider's Website pursuant to Section 3.14(d) of this Agreement), monthly regarding any actions taken by the Special Servicer with respect to any Mortgaged Property securing a Defaulted Mortgage Loan or defaulted Serviced Companion Loan as to which the environmental testing contemplated by Section 3.10(f) of this Agreement has revealed that either of the conditions set forth in clauses (i) and (ii) of the first sentence thereof has not been satisfied, in each case until the earlier to occur of (i) satisfaction of both such conditions, (ii) repurchase of the related Mortgage Loan by the Mortgage Loan Seller or (iii) release of the lien of the related Mortgage on such Mortgaged Property.



 (h)           If the Special Servicer determines pursuant to Section 3.10(f)(i) of this Agreement that a Mortgaged Property is not in compliance with applicable environmental laws but that it is in the best economic interest of the Trust Fund (and with respect to the Serviced Loan Combinations, the Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders), as a collective whole as if such Certificateholders and, if applicable, Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders constituted a single lender, to take such actions as are necessary to bring such Mortgaged Property in compliance therewith, or if the Special Servicer determines pursuant to Section 3.10(f)(ii) of this Agreement that the circumstances referred to therein relating to Hazardous Materials are present but that it is in the best economic interest of the Trust Fund (and with respect to the Serviced Loan Combinations, the Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders), as a collective whole as if such Certificateholders and, if applicable, Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders constituted a single lender, to take such action with respect to the containment, clean-up or remediation of Hazardous Materials affecting such Mortgaged Property as is required by law or regulation, the Special Servicer shall (with the consent of the Directing Holder, if no Control Termination Event has occurred and is continuing) take such action as it deems to be in the best economic interest of the Trust Fund (and with respect to the Serviced Loan Combinations, the Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders), as a collective whole as if such Certificateholders and, if applicable, Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders constituted a single lender, but only if the Certificate Administrator has mailed notice to the Holders of the Regular Certificates and the related







 Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders of such proposed action, which notice shall be prepared by the Special Servicer, and only if the Certificate Administrator does not receive, within 30 days of such notification, instructions from the Holders of Regular Certificates entitled to a majority of the Voting Rights and, with respect to Serviced Loan Combinations, the applicable Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders directing the Special Servicer not to take such action.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Special Servicer reasonably determines that it is likely that within such 30-day period irreparable environmental harm to such Mortgaged Property would result from the presence of such Hazardous Materials and provides a prior written statement to the Trustee and the Certificate Administrator setting forth the basis for such determination, then the Special Servicer may take or cause to be taken such action to remedy such condition as may be consistent with the Servicing Standard.  None of the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator, the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer shall be obligated to take any action or not take any action pursuant to this Section 3.10(h) at the direction of the Certificateholders or with respect to any Serviced Loan Combination, at the direction of the Certificateholders and the related Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders unless the Certificateholders and, with respect to any Serviced Companion Loan, the Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders agree to indemnify the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator, the Master Servicer and the Special Servicer with respect to such action or inaction.  The Master Servicer shall advance the cost of any such compliance, containment, clean-up or remediation as a Property Advance unless the Master Servicer determines, in its good faith judgment, that such Advance would constitute a Nonrecoverable Advance.



 (i)           The Special Servicer shall notify the Master Servicer of any Mortgaged Property (other than a Mortgaged Property securing a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan) which is abandoned or foreclosed that requires reporting to the IRS and shall provide the Master Servicer with all information regarding forgiveness of indebtedness and required to be reported with respect to any Mortgage Loan (other than a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan) or Serviced Loan Combination which is abandoned or foreclosed and the Master Servicer shall report to the IRS and the related Borrower, in the manner required by applicable law, such information and the Master Servicer shall report, via Form 1099C or Form 1099A, all forgiveness of indebtedness to the extent such information has been provided to the Master Servicer by the Special Servicer.  The Master Servicer shall deliver a copy of any such report to the Trustee and the Certificate Administrator.



 (j)           The costs of any Updated Valuation obtained pursuant to this Section 3.10 shall be paid by the Master Servicer as a Property Advance and shall be reimbursable from the Collection Account or, with respect to the Serviced Loan Combinations, first, from the applicable Serviced Loan Combination Collection Account and second, to the extent amounts in the Serviced Loan Combination Collection Accounts are insufficient therefor, from the Collection Account in accordance with Section 3.06(a); provided that the Master Servicer shall, after receiving payment from amounts on deposit in the Collection Account, if any, (i) promptly notify the related Companion Loan Noteholder and (ii) use commercially reasonable efforts to exercise on behalf of the Trust any rights under the related Intercreditor Agreement to obtain reimbursement for a pro rata portion of such amount allocable to the related Serviced Companion Loans from the related Companion Loan Noteholders.







 Section 3.11     Custodian to Cooperate; Release of Mortgage Files.  Upon the payment in full of any Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination, or the receipt by the Master Servicer of a notification that payment in full has been escrowed in a manner customary for such purposes, the Master Servicer shall immediately notify the Custodian by a certification (which certification shall include a statement to the effect that all amounts received or to be received in connection with such payment which are required to be deposited in the Collection Account or the applicable Serviced Loan Combination Collection Account, as applicable, pursuant to Section 3.05 of this Agreement have been or will be so deposited) of a Servicing Officer and shall request delivery to it of the related Mortgage File.  Any expense incurred in connection with any instrument of satisfaction or deed of reconveyance that is not paid by the related Borrower shall be chargeable to the Trust Fund.  The Master Servicer agrees to use reasonable efforts in accordance with the Servicing Standard to enforce any provision in the relevant Loan Documents that require the Borrower to pay such amounts.  No expenses incurred in connection with any instrument of satisfaction or deed of reconveyance shall be an expense of the Custodian.



 From time to time upon request of the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer and delivery to the Custodian of a Request for Release, the Custodian shall promptly release the Mortgage File (or any portion thereof) designated in such Request for Release to the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as applicable.  Upon return of the foregoing to the Custodian, or in the event of a liquidation or conversion of the Mortgage Loan or the Serviced Loan Combination into a Serviced REO Property, or in the event of a substitution of a Mortgage Loan pursuant to Section 2.03 of this Agreement, or receipt by the Custodian of a certificate of a Servicing Officer stating that such Mortgaged Property was liquidated and that all amounts received or to be received in connection with such liquidation which are required to be deposited into the Collection Account or the applicable Serviced Loan Combination Collection Account, as applicable, have been so deposited, or that such Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination has become a Serviced REO Property, or that the Master Servicer has received a Qualifying Substitute Mortgage Loan and the applicable Substitution Shortfall Amount, the Custodian shall deliver a copy of the Request for Release to the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as applicable.  If from time to time, pursuant to the terms of the applicable Intercreditor Agreement or Other Pooling and Servicing Agreement, and as appropriate for enforcing the terms of the related Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan, the Other Servicer or the Other Special Servicer requests delivery to it of the original Note by providing the Trustee and the Custodian a Request for Release, then the Custodian shall release or cause the release of such original Note to the Other Servicer or the Other Special Servicer or its designee.



 Within five (5) Business Days (or, in case of an emergency, within such shorter period as is reasonable under the circumstances) after receipt of a written certification of a Servicing Officer, the Trustee shall execute and deliver to the Master Servicer (with respect to Performing Loans) and the Special Servicer (with respect to Specially Serviced Loans and REO Loans) any court pleadings, requests for a trustee's sale or other documents prepared by the Special Servicer, its agents or attorneys, necessary to the foreclosure or trustee's sale in respect of a Mortgaged Property or to any legal action brought to obtain judgment against any Borrower on the Note or Mortgage or to obtain a deficiency judgment, or to enforce any other remedies or rights provided by the Note or Mortgage or otherwise available at law or in equity.  Each such certification shall include a request that such pleadings or documents be executed by the Trustee







 and a statement as to the reason such documents or pleadings are required, that the proposed action is consistent with the Servicing Standard and that the execution and delivery thereof by the Trustee will not invalidate or otherwise affect the lien of the Mortgage, except for the termination of such a lien upon completion of the foreclosure or trustee's sale.



 Section 3.12     Servicing Fees, Trustee/Certificate Administrator Fees and Special Servicing Compensation; CCRE Strips.

The Master Servicer and each holder of an Excess Servicing Fee Right desiring to effect a transfer, sale, pledge or other assignment of such Excess Servicing Fee Right shall, and the Master Servicer hereby agrees, and each such holder of an Excess Servicing Fee Right by its acceptance of such Excess Servicing Fee Right shall be deemed to have agreed, in connection with any transfer of such Excess Servicing Fee Right effected by such Person, to indemnify the Certificateholders, the Trust, the Depositor, the Underwriters, the Certificate Administrator, the Trustee, the Master Servicer, the Certificate Registrar, the Operating Advisor and the Special Servicer against any liability that may result if such transfer is not exempt from registration and/or qualification under the Act or other applicable federal and state securities laws or is not made in accordance with such federal and state laws or in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this paragraph.

The Special Servicer's rights to the Special Servicing Fee may not be transferred in whole or in part except in connection with the transfer of all of the Special Servicer's responsibilities and obligations under this Agreement.  In addition, the Special Servicer shall be entitled to receive, as Special Servicing Compensation, to the extent permitted by applicable law and the related Loan Documents, (i) any late payment charges and any Net Default Interest collected by the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer during a Collection Period accrued on any Specially Serviced Loan remaining after application thereof during such Collection Period (and in the case of the Serviced Loan Combinations, as set forth in and subject to the terms of the related Intercreditor Agreement and Section 3.12(d) herein) to pay the Advance Interest Amount relating to such Specially Serviced Loan and any unreimbursed Additional Trust Fund Expenses (including Special Servicing Fees, Workout Fees and Liquidation Fees) incurred during or prior to such Collection Period on such related Specially Serviced Loan (but not NSF check fees and the like, which shall be paid to the Master Servicer) as further described below in this subsection (b), (ii) 50% of any Assumption Fees, consent fees (or similar fees) relating to the transactions referred to in Section 3.09 of this Agreement, Modification Fees (and other similar fees) and loan service transaction fees, beneficiary statement charges or similar items with respect to the Performing Loans and the related Companion Loans relating to any Performing Loan, when processing by or the approval of the Special Servicer is required and excluding any Prepayment Premiums or Yield Maintenance Charges, (iii) any interest or other income earned on deposits in the REO Accounts and (iv) 100% of any Assumption Fees, assumption application fees, consent fees (or similar

 In addition, the Special Servicer shall be entitled to the portion of Net Default Interest and any late payment fees collected by the Other Special Servicer servicing the related Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan and that are allocated to such Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan remaining after application thereof during such Collection Period to pay the Advance Interest Amount relating to such Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan and any unreimbursed Additional Trust Fund Expenses (including Special Servicing Fees, Workout Fees and Liquidation Fees) incurred during or prior to such Collection Period on such related Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan (but not NSF check fees and similar fees, which shall be paid to the Master Servicer) as provided in this Agreement.  Except as specified in the preceding sentence, the Special Servicer will not be entitled to the compensation set forth in this Section 3.12(b) with respect to a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan.



 (c)           In addition, a Workout Fee will be payable to the Special Servicer with respect to each Mortgage Loan (other than any Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan) or Serviced Loan Combination that ceases to be a Specially Serviced Loan pursuant to the definition thereof.  As to each such Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination, the Workout Fee will be payable out of each collection of interest and principal (including scheduled payments, prepayments, Balloon Payments and payments at maturity) received on such Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination for so long as it remains a Corrected Mortgage Loan.  The Workout Fee with respect to any such Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination will cease to be payable if such loan again becomes a Specially Serviced Loan or if the related Mortgaged Property becomes a Serviced REO Property; provided that a new Workout Fee will become payable if and when such Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination again ceases to be a Specially Serviced Loan.  If the Special Servicer is terminated (other than for cause) or resigns with respect to any or all of its servicing duties, it shall retain the right to receive any and all Workout Fees payable with respect to the Mortgage Loans or Serviced Loan Combinations that cease to be a Specially Serviced Loan during the period that it had responsibility for servicing such Specially Serviced Loan (or for any Specially Serviced Loan that had not yet become a Corrected Mortgage Loan because as of the time that the Special Servicer is terminated the borrower has not made three consecutive monthly debt service payments and subsequently the Specially Serviced Loan becomes a Corrected Mortgage Loan) at the time of such termination or resignation (and the successor Special Servicer shall not be entitled to any portion of such Workout Fees), in each case until the Workout Fee for any such loan ceases to be payable in accordance with the preceding sentence.



 A Liquidation Fee will be payable to the Special Servicer with respect to each Mortgage Loan repurchased by a Mortgage Loan Seller after the Initial Resolution Period (and giving effect to any Resolution Extension Period) in accordance with Section 2.03(e) of this Agreement or Specially Serviced Loan as to which the Special Servicer obtains a full, partial or discounted payoff from the related Borrower and, except as otherwise described below, with







 respect to any Specially Serviced Loan or Serviced REO Property as to which the Special Servicer recovered any Liquidation Proceeds.  As to each such Mortgage Loan repurchased by a Mortgage Loan Seller after the Initial Resolution Period (and giving effect to any Resolution Extension Period) in accordance with Section 2.03(e) of this Agreement or Specially Serviced Loan and Serviced REO Property, the Liquidation Fee will be payable from the related payment or proceeds.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary described above, no Liquidation Fee will be payable based on, or out of, Liquidation Proceeds to the extent set forth in the definition of "Liquidation Fee" herein.  With respect to any future mezzanine debt, to the extent not prohibited by the Loan Documents, the Master Servicer or Special Servicer, as applicable, shall require that the related mezzanine intercreditor agreement provide that if a Mortgage Loan is purchased by the related mezzanine lender on a date that is more than 90 days following the date that the related option becomes exercisable, such mezzanine lender shall be required to pay a Liquidation Fee equal to the amount that the Special Servicer would otherwise be entitled to under this Agreement with respect to a liquidation of such Mortgage Loan (provided, that such Liquidation Fee shall in all circumstances be payable by the related mezzanine lender and shall not, under any circumstances, be payable out of the Trust unless the Master Servicer fails to require the related mezzanine intercreditor agreement to require the mezzanine lender to pay such amounts in breach of its obligation to do so under this paragraph).  If Liquidation Proceeds are received with respect to any Specially Serviced Loan as to which the Special Servicer is properly entitled to a Workout Fee, such Workout Fee will be payable based on and out of the portion of such Liquidation Proceeds that constitute principal and/or interest.  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Special Servicer shall only be entitled to receive a Liquidation Fee or a Workout Fee, but not both, with respect to Liquidation Proceeds received on any Mortgage Loan or any Specially Serviced Loan.  If (i) the Special Servicer resigns or has been terminated, and (ii) either prior or subsequent to such resignation or termination, either (A) a Specially Serviced Loan was liquidated or modified pursuant to an action plan submitted by the initial Special Servicer and approved (or deemed approved) by the Directing Holder or the Special Servicer has determined to grant a forbearance, or (B) a Specially Serviced Loan being monitored by the Special Servicer subsequently became a Corrected Mortgage Loan, then in either such event the Special Servicer shall be paid the related Workout Fee or Liquidation Fee, as applicable.



 The total amount of Workout Fees and Liquidation Fees that are payable by the Trust with respect to each Mortgage Loan, Serviced Loan Combination or Serviced REO Loan through the period such Mortgage Loan is an asset of the Trust shall be subject to an aggregate cap of $1,000,000.  For the purposes of determining whether any such cap has been reached with respect to a Special Servicer and a Mortgage Loan, Serviced Loan Combination or Serviced REO Loan, only the Workout Fees and Liquidation Fees paid to such Special Servicer with respect to such Mortgage Loan, Serviced Loan Combination or Serviced REO Loan shall be taken into account, and any Workout Fees or Liquidation Fees for any other Mortgage Loans, Serviced Loan Combinations or Serviced REO Loans shall not be taken into account (and any Workout Fees or Liquidation Fees paid to a predecessor or successor special servicer or Other Special Servicer shall also not be taken into account).



 The Special Servicer shall be required to pay out of its own funds all expenses incurred by it in connection with its servicing activities hereunder (including, without limitation, any amounts, other than management fees in respect of REO Properties, due and owing to any of







 its sub-servicers, any amounts due and owing to any of its Affiliates, and the premiums for any blanket Insurance Policy obtained by it insuring against hazard losses pursuant to Section 3.08 of this Agreement, except to the extent such premiums are reimbursable pursuant to Section 3.08 of this Agreement), if and to the extent such expenses are not expressly payable directly out of the Collection Account or if a Serviced Loan Combination is involved, the applicable Serviced Loan Combination Collection Account or the applicable REO Account or as a Property Advance, and the Special Servicer shall not be entitled to reimbursement therefor except as expressly provided in this Agreement.



 The Special Servicer and its Affiliates shall be prohibited from receiving or retaining any compensation or any other remuneration (including, without limitation, in the form of commissions, brokerage fees, rebates, or as a result of any other fee-sharing arrangement) from any Person (including, without limitation, the Trust, any Borrower, any Manager, any guarantor or indemnitor in respect of a Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination and any purchaser of any Mortgage Loan, Serviced Companion Loan or REO Property) in connection with the disposition, workout or foreclosure of any Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination, the management or disposition of any REO Property, or the performance of any other special servicing duties under this Agreement, other than as expressly provided in this Section 3.12; provided that such prohibition shall not apply to Permitted Special Servicer/Affiliate Fees.



 (d)           In determining the compensation of the Master Servicer or Special Servicer, as applicable, with respect to Penalty Charges, on any Distribution Date, the aggregate Penalty Charges collected on any Mortgage Loan or, unless prohibited by the related Intercreditor Agreement to be so applied, any Serviced Companion Loan, during the related Collection Period shall be applied (as between Default Interest and late payment charges, in the priority set forth in the definition of "Advance Interest Amount") to reimburse (i) (A) the Master Servicer or the Trustee for interest on Advances at the Advance Rate with respect to such Mortgage Loan that accrued in the period that such Penalty Charges were collected and (B) any related Serviced Companion Loan Service Provider for interest on debt service advances made by such party with respect to any related Serviced Companion Loan that accrued in the period that such Penalty Charges were collected, (ii) the Trust Fund for all interest on Advances with respect to such Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination previously paid to the Master Servicer, the Trustee or to any Serviced Companion Loan Service Provider pursuant to Section 3.06(a)(vi) or Section 3.06(b)(vi) of this Agreement, and (iii) the Trust Fund for any Additional Trust Fund Expenses (including Special Servicing Fees, Workout Fees and Liquidation Fees) with respect to such Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination paid in the Collection Period that such Penalty Charges were collected and not previously paid out of Penalty Charges, and any Penalty Charges remaining thereafter shall be distributed pro rata to the Master Servicer and the Special Servicer based upon the amount of Penalty Charges the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer would otherwise have been entitled to receive during such period with respect to such Mortgage Loan without any such application.  Except as set forth in this Agreement, the Special Servicer shall not be entitled to any Special Servicing Fees, Workout Fees or Liquidation Fees with respect to any Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan or any related REO Property.  For the avoidance of doubt, the portion of Penalty Charges allocated to a Mortgage Loan that is part of a Non-Serviced Loan Combination (in accordance with the applicable Intercreditor Agreement and, if applicable, the Other Pooling and Servicing







 Agreement) shall be allocated in accordance with clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) above (except that, Advances in clauses (i) and (ii) shall mean P&I Advances).



 (e)           The Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Certificate Administrator and the Trustee shall be entitled to reimbursement from the Trust Fund (and, prior to recovery from the Trust Fund, in the case of any Serviced Loan Combination, subject to the related Intercreditor Agreement, first, out of the related Serviced Loan Combination Collection Account from collections on the related Serviced Companion Loan and the related Mortgage Loan on a pro rata basis by principal balance, and second, to the extent any such costs and expenses remain unreimbursed, out of the Collection Account) for the costs and expenses incurred by them in the performance of their duties under this Agreement which are "unanticipated expenses incurred by the REMIC" within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.860G-1(b)(3)(iii).  Such expenses shall include, by way of example and not by way of limitation, environmental assessments, Updated Appraisals and appraisals in connection with foreclosure, the fees and expenses of any administrative or judicial proceeding and expenses expressly identified as reimbursable in Section 3.06(a)(xv) of this Agreement.  All such costs and expenses shall be treated as costs and expenses of the Lower-Tier REMIC and the related Serviced Loan Combination, if applicable.



 (f)           No provision of this Agreement or of the Certificates shall require the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Operating Advisor, the Certificate Administrator or the Trustee to expend or risk their own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the performance of any of their duties hereunder or thereunder, or in the exercise of any of their rights or powers, if, in the good faith business judgment of the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Operating Advisor, the Certificate Administrator or the Trustee, as the case may be, repayment of such funds would not be ultimately recoverable from late payments, Net Insurance Proceeds, Net Liquidation Proceeds and other collections on or in respect of the Mortgage Loans, or from adequate indemnity from other assets comprising the Trust Fund against such risk or liability.



 If the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Certificate Administrator, the Operating Advisor or the Trustee receives a request or inquiry from a Borrower, any Certificateholder or any other Person the response to which would, in the Master Servicer's, the Special Servicer's, the Certificate Administrator's, the Operating Advisor's or the Trustee's good faith business judgment require the assistance of Independent legal counsel or other consultant to the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Certificate Administrator, the Operating Advisor or the Trustee, the cost of which would not be an expense of the Trust Fund or any Serviced Companion Loan Noteholder hereunder, then the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Certificate Administrator, the Operating Advisor or the Trustee, as the case may be, shall not be required to take any action in response to such request or inquiry unless such Borrower, such Certificateholder, or such other Person, as applicable, makes arrangements for the payment of the Master Servicer's, the Special Servicer's, the Certificate Administrator's, the Operating Advisor's or the Trustee's expenses associated with such counsel (including, without limitation, posting an advance payment for such expenses) satisfactory to the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Certificate Administrator, the Operating Advisor or the Trustee, as the case may be, in its sole discretion.  Unless such arrangements have been made, the Master Servicer, the







 Special Servicer, the Certificate Administrator, the Operating Advisor or the Trustee, as the case may be, shall have no liability to any Person for the failure to respond to such request or inquiry.



 From collections actually received by the Master Servicer related to the Mortgage Loans that are part of the CCRE Strip Pool or any successor REO Loans, on each Servicer Remittance Date, the Master Servicer shall remit, pursuant to Section 4.06(i), the accrued but unpaid CCRE Strips to CCRE or its successors or assigns or its designee by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account specified by the intended recipient or by such other method as such recipient and the Master Servicer shall mutually and reasonably agree. CCRE's right to receive the CCRE Strips shall be subordinate to the Master Servicer's right to receive the Master Servicer Fee and any other amounts due and owing to the Master Servicer pursuant to the terms hereof and the Special Servicer's right to receive Special Servicing Compensation and any other amounts due and owing to the Special Servicer pursuant to the terms hereof. CCRE may assign all or a portion of the CCRE Strips at any time.

In the case of a licensed or registered investment advisor acting on behalf of a current or prospective Certificateholder, the Investor Certification shall be executed and delivered by both the investment advisor and such current or prospective Certificateholder.



 Neither the Master Servicer nor the Special Servicer shall be liable for its dissemination of information in accordance with this Agreement or by others in violation of the terms of this Agreement. Neither the Master Servicer nor the Special Servicer shall be responsible or have any liability for the completeness or accuracy of the information delivered, produced or otherwise made available pursuant to this Section 3.14 unless (i) the Master Servicer or Special Servicer, as applicable, is the original source for such information and (ii) such failure to deliver complete and accurate information is by reason of such party's willful misconduct, bad faith, fraud and/or negligence.



 In connection with the delivery by the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as applicable, to the 17g-5 Information Provider of any information, report, notice or document for posting to the 17g-5 Information Provider's Website, the 17g-5 Information Provider shall notify the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as applicable, of when such information, report, notice or document has been posted to the 17g-5 Information Provider's Website.

 (f)           The Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Certificate Administrator, the Operating Advisor and the Trustee shall be permitted (but shall not be required) to orally communicate with the Rating Agencies regarding any Mortgage Loan, Serviced Loan Combination, any Certificateholder, any Serviced Companion Loan Noteholder, any Mortgaged Property or any REO Property; provided that such party summarizes the information provided to the Rating Agencies in such communication and provides the 17g-5 Information Provider and the related Other 17g-5 Information Provider (if applicable) with such summary in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 3.14(d) of this Agreement the same day such communication takes place; provided that the summary of such oral communications shall not attribute which Rating Agency the communication was with.  The 17g-5 Information Provider shall post such summary on the 17g-5 Information Provider's Website in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 3.14(d) of this Agreement.



 (g)           None of the foregoing restrictions in this Section 3.14 or otherwise in this Agreement shall prohibit or restrict oral or written communications, or providing information, between the Master Servicer, the Operating Advisor or the Special Servicer, on the one hand, and any Rating Agency or NRSRO, on the other hand, with regard to (i) such Rating Agency's or NRSRO's review of the ratings it assigns to the Master Servicer, the Operating Advisor or the Special Servicer, as applicable, (ii) such Rating Agency's or NRSRO's approval of the Master Servicer, the Operating Advisor or the Special Servicer, as applicable, as a commercial mortgage master, special or primary servicer or (iii) such Rating Agency's or NRSRO's evaluation of the Master Servicer's, the Operating Advisor or the Special Servicer's, as applicable, servicing operations in general; provided, that the Master Servicer, the Operating Advisor or the Special Servicer, as applicable, shall not provide any information relating to the Certificates or the Mortgage Loans to any Rating Agency or NRSRO in connection with such review and evaluation by such Rating Agency or NRSRO unless (x) Borrower, property and other deal specific identifiers are redacted; or (y) such information has already been provided to the 17g-5 Information Provider and has been uploaded on to the 17g-5 Information Provider's Website.



 (h)           The costs and expenses of compliance with this Section 3.14 by the Depositor, the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Trustee and any other party hereto shall not be Additional Trust Fund Expenses.



 Section 3.15      Title and Management of REO Properties and REO Accounts. (a)  If title to any Mortgaged Property (other than with respect to a Non-Serviced Mortgaged Loan) is acquired for the benefit of Certificateholders (and, in the case of the Serviced Loan Combinations, the related Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders) in foreclosure, by deed in lieu of foreclosure or upon abandonment or reclamation from bankruptcy, the deed or certificate of sale shall be taken in the name of the Trust where permitted by applicable law or regulation and consistent with customary servicing procedures, and otherwise in the name of the Trustee, or its nominee (which shall not include the Master Servicer), or a separate Trustee or co-Trustee, on behalf of the Trust Fund (and, in the case of the Serviced Loan Combinations, the related Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders).  The Special Servicer, on behalf of the Trust Fund (and, in the case of the Serviced Loan Combinations, the related Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders), shall dispose of any Serviced REO Property prior to the close of the third calendar







 year following the year in which the Trust Fund acquires ownership of such Serviced REO Property for purposes of Section 860G(a)(8) of the Code, unless (i) the Special Servicer on behalf of the Lower-Tier REMIC has applied for an extension of such period pursuant to Sections 856(e)(3) and 860G(a)(8)(A) of the Code, in which case the Special Servicer shall sell such Serviced REO Property within the applicable extension period or if the Special Servicer has applied for extension as provided in this clause (i) but such request has not yet been granted or denied, the additional time specified in such request, or (ii) the Special Servicer seeks and subsequently receives an Opinion of Counsel (which opinion shall be an expense of the Trust Fund and, in the case of a Serviced Loan Combination, such expenses shall be allocated in accordance with the allocation provisions set forth in the related Intercreditor Agreement, addressed to the Special Servicer, the Certificate Administrator and the Trustee, to the effect that the holding by the Trust Fund of such Serviced REO Property for an additional specified period will not cause such Serviced REO Property to fail to qualify as "foreclosure property" within the meaning of Section 860G(a)(8) of the Code (determined without regard to the exception applicable for purposes of Section 860D(a) of the Code) at any time that any Certificate is outstanding, in which event such period shall be extended by such additional specified period subject to any conditions set forth in such Opinion of Counsel.  The Special Servicer, on behalf of the Trust Fund (and, in the case of the Serviced Loan Combinations, the related Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders), shall dispose of any Serviced REO Property held by the Trust Fund prior to the last day of such period (taking into account extensions) by which such Serviced REO Property is required to be disposed of pursuant to the provisions of the immediately preceding sentence in a manner provided under Section 3.16 hereof.  In the case of the Trust Fund's beneficial interest in any REO Property acquired by the Other Trustee pursuant to an Other Pooling and Servicing Agreement, the Special Servicer shall coordinate with the Other Special Servicer with respect to any REO extension on behalf of the Trust Fund.  The Special Servicer shall manage, conserve, protect and operate each Serviced REO Property for the Certificateholders (and, in the case of the Serviced Loan Combinations, the related Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders) solely for the purpose of its prompt disposition and sale in a manner which does not cause such Serviced REO Property to fail to qualify as "foreclosure property" within the meaning of Section 860G(a)(8) of the Code (determined without regard to the exception applicable for purposes of Section 860D(a) of the Code) and such that income from the operation or sale of such property does not result in receipt by the Trust Fund of any income from non-permitted assets as described in Section 860F(a)(2)(B) of the Code with respect to such property.



 (b)           The Special Servicer shall have full power and authority, subject only to the Servicing Standard and the specific requirements and prohibitions of this Agreement, to do any and all things in connection with any Serviced REO Property as are consistent with the manner in which the Special Servicer manages and operates similar property owned or managed by the Special Servicer or any of its Affiliates, all on such terms and for such period as the Special Servicer deems to be in the best interests of Certificateholders and, in the case of the Serviced Loan Combinations, the related Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders and, in connection therewith, the Special Servicer shall agree to the payment of management fees that are consistent with general market standards.  Consistent with the foregoing, the Special Servicer shall cause or permit to be earned with respect to such Serviced REO Property any "net income from foreclosure property," within the meaning of Section 860G(c) of the Code, which is subject to tax under the REMIC Provisions, only if it has determined, and has so advised the Trustee and







 the Certificate Administrator in writing, that the earning of such income on a net after-tax basis could reasonably be expected to result in a greater recovery on behalf of Certificateholders (and, in the case of the Serviced Loan Combinations, the related Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders) than an alternative method of operation or rental of such Serviced REO Property that would not be subject to such a tax.



 The Special Servicer shall segregate and hold all revenues received by it with respect to any Serviced REO Property separate and apart from its own funds and general assets and shall establish and maintain with respect to any Serviced REO Property a segregated custodial account (each, an "REO Account"), each of which shall be an Eligible Account and shall be entitled "LNR Partners, LLC, as Special Servicer, on behalf of UxxPDSxxPD Bank National Association, as Trustee, for the benefit of the Holders of COMM 2013-CCRE12 Mortgage Trust Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, REO Account."  With respect to a Serviced REO Property securing a Serviced Loan Combination, the Special Servicer shall establish an REO Account solely with respect to such property (each such account, a "Serviced Loan Combination REO Account"), each of which shall be an Eligible Account and shall be entitled "LNR Partners, LLC, as Special Servicer, on behalf of UxxPDSxxPD Bank National Association, as Trustee, for the benefit of the Holders of COMM 2013-CCRE12 Mortgage Trust Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates and the related Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders, REO Account," to be held for the benefit of the Certificateholders and the related Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders.  The Special Servicer shall be entitled to withdraw for its account any interest or investment income earned on funds deposited in an REO Account or Serviced Loan Combination REO Account to the extent provided in Section 3.07(b) of this Agreement.  The Special Servicer shall deposit or cause to be deposited REO Proceeds in the REO Account or the applicable Serviced Loan Combination REO Account within one Business Day after receipt of such REO Proceeds, and shall withdraw therefrom funds necessary for the proper operation, management and maintenance of such Serviced REO Property and for other Property Protection Expenses with respect to such Serviced REO Property, including:



 (i)           all insurance premiums due and payable in respect of any Serviced REO Property;



 (ii)          all real estate taxes and assessments in respect of any Serviced REO Property that may result in the imposition of a lien thereon;



 (iii)        all costs and expenses reasonable and necessary to protect, maintain, manage, operate, repair and restore any Serviced REO Property including, if applicable, the payments of any ground rents in respect of such Serviced REO Property; and



 (iv)        any taxes imposed on the Lower-Tier REMIC in respect of net income from foreclosure property in accordance with Section 4.05, and with respect to a Serviced Loan Combination, such expenses shall be allocated pro rata to the Mortgage Loan and any related Serviced Companion Loans based on each loan's Stated Principal Balance and only to the extent any such Serviced Companion Loan is included in a REMIC.



 To the extent that such REO Proceeds are insufficient for the purposes set forth in clauses (i) through (iii) above, the Master Servicer shall make such Advance unless the Master Servicer determines, in accordance with the Servicing Standard, that such Property Advance







 would constitute a Nonrecoverable Advance (provided that with respect to advancing insurance premiums or delinquent tax assessments the Master Servicer shall comply with the provisions of the second to last paragraph in Section 3.21(d) of this Agreement) and if the Master Servicer does not make any such Advance, the Trustee, to the extent the Trustee has actual knowledge of the Master Servicer's failure to make such Advance, shall make such Advance, unless in each case, the Master Servicer or the Trustee, as applicable, determines that such Advance would be a Nonrecoverable Advance.  The Trustee shall be entitled to rely, conclusively, on any determination by the Special Servicer or the Master Servicer, as applicable, that an Advance, if made, would be a Nonrecoverable Advance.  The Trustee, when making an independent determination whether or not a proposed Advance would be a Nonrecoverable Advance, shall be subject to the standards applicable to the Master Servicer hereunder.  The Master Servicer or the Trustee, as applicable, shall be entitled to reimbursement of such Advances (with interest at the Advance Rate) made pursuant to the preceding sentence, to the extent permitted by Section 3.06 of this Agreement.  The Special Servicer shall withdraw from each REO Account or Serviced Loan Combination REO Account, as applicable, and remit to the Master Servicer for deposit into the Collection Account or the applicable Serviced Loan Combination Collection Account, as applicable, on a monthly basis prior to or on the related Due Date the Net REO Proceeds received or collected from each Serviced REO Property, except that in determining the amount of such Net REO Proceeds, the Special Servicer may retain in each REO Account or Serviced Loan Combination REO Account, as applicable, reasonable reserves for repairs, replacements and necessary capital improvements and other related expenses.



 Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Special Servicer shall not:



 (i)           permit any New Lease to be entered into, renewed or extended, if the New Lease by its terms will give rise to any income that does not constitute Rents from Real Property;



 (ii)          permit any amount to be received or accrued under any New Lease, other than amounts that will constitute Rents from Real Property;



 (iii)         authorize or permit any construction on any Serviced REO Property, other than the repair or maintenance thereof or the completion of a building or other improvement thereon, and then only if more than ten percent of the construction of such building or other improvement was completed before default on the related Mortgage Loan became imminent, all within the meaning of Section 856(e)(4)(B) of the Code; or



 (iv)         Directly Operate or allow any Person to Directly Operate any Serviced REO Property on any date more than 90 days after its date of acquisition by the Trust Fund, unless such Person is an Independent Contractor;



 unless, in any such case, the Special Servicer has requested and received an Opinion of Counsel addressed to the Special Servicer, the Certificate Administrator and the Trustee (which opinion shall be an expense of the Trust Fund and, in the case of a Serviced Loan Combination with a Serviced Companion Loan, such expense shall be allocated in accordance with the allocation provisions of the related Intercreditor Agreement) to the effect that such action will not cause such Serviced REO Property to fail to qualify as "foreclosure property" within the meaning of Section 860G(a)(8) of the Code (determined without regard to the exception applicable for







 purposes of Section 860D(a) of the Code) at any time that it is held by the Trust Fund, in which case the Special Servicer may take such actions as are specified in such Opinion of Counsel.



 The Special Servicer shall be required to contract with an Independent Contractor, the fees and expenses of which shall be an expense of the Trust Fund (and, in the case of the Serviced Loan Combinations, such expense shall be allocated in accordance with the allocation provisions of the related Intercreditor Agreement) and payable out of REO Proceeds, for the operation and management of any Serviced REO Property, within 90 days of the Trust Fund's acquisition thereof (unless the Special Servicer shall have provided the Trustee and the Certificate Administrator with an Opinion of Counsel that the operation and management of any Serviced REO Property other than through an Independent Contractor shall not cause such Serviced REO Property to fail to qualify as "foreclosure property" within the meaning of Section 860G(a)(8) of the Code) (which opinion shall be an expense of the Trust Fund, and in the case of a Serviced Loan Combination, such expense shall be allocated in accordance with the allocation provisions of the related Intercreditor Agreement), provided that:



 (i)           the terms and conditions of any such contract shall be reasonable and customary for the area and type of property and shall not be inconsistent herewith;



 (ii)         any such contract shall require, or shall be administered to require, that the Independent Contractor pay all costs and expenses incurred in connection with the operation and management of such Serviced REO Property, including those listed above, and remit all related revenues (net of such costs and expenses) to the Special Servicer as soon as practicable, but in no event later than 30 days following the receipt thereof by such Independent Contractor;



 (iii)         none of the provisions of this Section 3.15(b) relating to any such contract or to actions taken through any such Independent Contractor shall be deemed to relieve the Special Servicer of any of its duties and obligations to the Trust Fund, the Trustee on behalf of the Certificateholders and, in the case of a Serviced Loan Combination, the related Companion Loan Noteholders, with respect to the operation and management of any such Serviced REO Property; and



 (iv)        the Special Servicer shall be obligated with respect thereto to the same extent as if it alone were performing all duties and obligations in connection with the operation and management of such Serviced REO Property.



 The Special Servicer shall be entitled to enter into any agreement with any Independent Contractor performing services for it related to its duties and obligations hereunder for indemnification of the Special Servicer by such Independent Contractor, and nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to limit or modify such indemnification.



 (c)           Promptly following any acquisition by the Special Servicer of a Serviced REO Property on behalf of the Trust Fund, the Special Servicer shall notify the Master Servicer thereof, and, upon delivery of such notice, the Special Servicer shall obtain an Updated Valuation thereof, but only if any Updated Valuation with respect thereto is more than 9 months old and the Special Servicer has no actual knowledge of any material adverse change in circumstances that, consistent with the Servicing Standard, would call into question the validity







 of such Updated Valuation, in order to determine the fair market value of such Serviced REO Property and shall notify the Depositor and the Master Servicer and with respect to a Serviced Loan Combination, the holder of the related Companion Loan, if any, and of the results of such Updated Valuation.  Any such Updated Appraisal shall be conducted in accordance with Appraisal Institute standards and the cost thereof shall be an expense of the Trust Fund allocated, to the Classes of Sequential Pay Certificates (other than any Exchangeable Certificates) and the Class EC Regular Interests (and, correspondingly to the Exchangeable Certificates) in the following order, in each case until the Certificate Balance of such Class of Certificates or such Regular Interest is reduced to zero: first, to the Class G Certificates; second, to the Class F Certificates; third, to the Class E Certificates; fourth, to the Class D Certificates; fifth, to the Class C Regular Interest (and, correspondingly, the Class C Certificates and the Class PEZ Component C, pro rata based on their respective Tranche Percentage Interests in the Class C Regular Interest); sixth, to the Class B Regular Interest (and, correspondingly, the Class B Certificates and the Class PEZ Component B, pro rata based on their respective Tranche Percentage Interests in the Class B Regular Interest); seventh, to the Class A-M Regular Interest (and, correspondingly, the Class A-M Certificates and the Class PEZ Component A-M, pro rata based on their respective Tranche Percentage Interests in the Class A-M Regular Interest); and then to the Class A-1, Class A-2, Class A-3, Class A-4 and Class A-SB Certificates, pro rata based on their respective Certificate Balances.  In the case of any Serviced Loan Combination such expenses shall be allocated in accordance with the allocation provisions set forth in the related Intercreditor Agreement.  The Special Servicer shall obtain a new Updated Valuation or a letter update every 9 months thereafter until the Serviced REO Property is sold.



 (d)           When and as necessary, the Special Servicer shall send to the Certificate Administrator a statement prepared by the Special Servicer setting forth the amount of net income or net loss, as determined for federal income tax purposes, resulting from the operation and management of a trade or business on, the furnishing or rendering of a non-customary service to the tenants of, or the receipt of any other amount not constituting Rents from Real Property in respect of, any Serviced REO Property in accordance with Sections 3.15(a) and 3.15(b) of this Agreement.



 (e)           Upon the disposition of any Serviced REO Property in accordance with this Section 3.15, the Special Servicer shall calculate the Excess Liquidation Proceeds allocable to a Mortgage Loan or the applicable Serviced Loan Combination, if any, realized in connection with such sale.



 Section 3.16        Sale of Specially Serviced Loans and REO Properties.  (a)  The parties hereto may sell or purchase, or permit the sale or purchase of, a Mortgage Loan (other than a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan) or Serviced Loan Combination only on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Section 3.16 or as otherwise expressly provided in or contemplated by Section 2.03(e) and Section 9.01 of this Agreement or in an applicable Intercreditor Agreement.



 (b)           If the Special Servicer determines in accordance with the Servicing Standard that it would be in the best interests of the Certificateholders and, in the case of a Serviced Loan Combination, the Certificateholders and the related Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders (as a collective whole as if such Certificateholders and, if applicable, Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders constituted a single lender) to attempt to sell a Defaulted







 Mortgage Loan (other than a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan) and any related Serviced Companion Loan, the Special Servicer shall use reasonable efforts to solicit offers for each such Defaulted Mortgage Loan on behalf of the Certificateholders and, if applicable, the related Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders in such manner as will be reasonably likely to realize a fair price; provided that with respect to any Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan, the Special Servicer shall be entitled to sell such Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan if it determines in accordance with the Servicing Standard (taking into consideration the rights of the holder of the Non-Serviced Companion Loan and the related Other Special Servicer with respect thereto under the related Intercreditor Agreement and Other Pooling and Servicing Agreement) that such action would be in the best interests of the Certificateholders.  The Special Servicer shall accept the first (and, if multiple offers are received, the highest cash offer received in the solicitation process within the time frame set for such process by the Special Servicer) cash offer received from any Person that constitutes a fair price for such Defaulted Mortgage Loan.



 The Special Servicer shall give the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator, the Master Servicer, the Operating Advisor and the Directing Holder, not less than ten Business Days' prior written notice of its intention to sell any such Defaulted Mortgage Loan, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, neither the Trustee, in its individual capacity, nor any of its Affiliates may make an offer for or purchase any such Defaulted Mortgage Loan pursuant to this Agreement.



 (c)           Whether any cash offer constitutes a fair price for such Defaulted Mortgage Loan, as the case may be, shall be determined by the Special Servicer, if the highest offeror is a Person other than an Interested Person, and by the Trustee, if the highest offeror is an Interested Person; provided, that no offer from an Interested Person shall constitute a fair price unless it is the highest offer received.  In determining whether any offer received from an Interested Person represents a fair price for any such Defaulted Mortgage Loan, the Trustee shall be supplied with and shall rely on the most recent appraisal or Updated Appraisal conducted in accordance with this Agreement within the preceding 9-month period or in the absence of any such appraisal, on a narrative appraisal prepared by an Independent MAI Appraiser selected by the Special Servicer if the Special Servicer or an Affiliate of the Special Servicer is not making an offer with respect to such Defaulted Mortgage Loan (or by the Master Servicer if the Special Servicer is making such an offer).  The cost of any such Updated Appraisal or narrative appraisal shall be covered by, and shall be reimbursable as, a Property Advance.  The Trustee may conclusively rely on any opinions or reports of qualified Independent experts in real estate or commercial mortgage loan matters with at least five years' experience in valuing or investing in loans similar to the subject Defaulted Mortgage Loan, selected with reasonable care by the Trustee, in making such determination.  Any related costs and fees of the Trustee shall be reimbursable by the related Interested Person.



 In determining whether any offer from a Person other than an Interested Person constitutes a fair price for any such Defaulted Mortgage Loan, the Special Servicer shall take into account (in addition to the results of any appraisal, updated appraisal or narrative appraisal that it may have obtained pursuant to this Agreement within the prior 9 months), and in determining whether any offer from an Interested Person constitutes a fair price for any such Defaulted Mortgage Loan, any appraiser shall be instructed to take into account, as applicable, among other factors, the period and amount of the Delinquency on such Defaulted Mortgage







 Loan, the period and amount of the occupancy level and physical condition of the related Mortgaged Property, the state of the local economy in the area where the Mortgaged Property is located, the expected recovery from such Defaulted Mortgage Loan if the Special Servicer were to pursue a workout strategy, and the time and expense associated with a purchaser's foreclosing on the related Mortgaged Property.



 In addition, the Special Servicer shall refer to all other relevant information obtained by it or otherwise contained in the Mortgage File; provided that the Special Servicer shall take account of any change in circumstances regarding the related Mortgaged Property known to the Special Servicer that has occurred subsequent to, and that would, in the Special Servicer's reasonable judgment, materially affect the value of the related Mortgaged Property reflected in the most recent related Appraisal.  Furthermore, the Special Servicer may consider available objective third party information obtained from generally available sources, as well as information obtained from vendors providing real estate services to the Special Servicer, concerning the market for distressed real estate loans and the real estate market for the subject property type in the area where the related Mortgaged Property is located.  The Special Servicer may, to the extent it is reasonable to do so in accordance with the Servicing Standard, conclusively rely on any opinions or reports of qualified Independent experts in real estate or commercial mortgage loan matters with at least five years' experience in valuing or investing in loans similar to the subject Specially Serviced Loan, selected with reasonable care by the Special Servicer, in making such determination.  All reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the Special Servicer pursuant to this Section 3.16(c) shall constitute, and be reimbursable as, Property Advances.  The other parties to this Agreement shall cooperate with all reasonable requests for information made by the Special Servicer in order to allow the Special Servicer to perform its duties pursuant to this Section 3.16(c).



 The Repurchase Price (which, in connection with the administration of a Defaulted Mortgage Loan related to a Serviced Loan Combination, shall be construed and calculated as if the loans in such Serviced Loan Combination together constitute a single Mortgage Loan thereunder) for any such Defaulted Mortgage Loan shall in all cases be deemed a fair price.



 (d)           Subject to subsection (c) above, the Special Servicer shall act on behalf of the Trustee (for the benefit of the Certificateholders and, in the case of a Serviced Loan Combination, the related Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders) in negotiating and taking any other action necessary or appropriate in connection with the sale of any such Defaulted Mortgage Loan, and the applicable collection of all amounts payable in connection therewith.  In connection therewith, the Special Servicer may charge for its own account prospective offerors, and may retain, fees that approximate the Special Servicer's actual costs in the preparation and delivery of information pertaining to such sales or exchanging offers without obligation to deposit such amounts into the REO Account, the Collection Account or, in the case of any Serviced Loan Combination, the applicable Serviced Loan Combination Collection Account.  Any sale of such Defaulted Mortgage Loan shall be final and without recourse to the Trustee or the Trust Fund (except such recourse to the Trust Fund imposed by those representations and warranties typically given in such transactions, any prorations applied thereto and any customary closing matters), and if such sale is consummated in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, none of the Special Servicer, the Master Servicer, the Depositor, the Certificate







 Administrator, the Operating Advisor or the Trustee shall have any liability to any Certificateholder or Companion Loan Noteholder with respect to the purchase price therefor accepted by the Special Servicer or the Trustee.



 (e)           Any sale of such Defaulted Mortgage Loan shall be for cash only.



 (f)           The parties hereto may sell or purchase, or permit the sale or purchase of, a Serviced REO Property only on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Section 3.16 or as otherwise expressly provided in an applicable Intercreditor Agreement.



 (g)           The Special Servicer shall use reasonable efforts to solicit offers for each Serviced REO Property on behalf of the Certificateholders and, in the case of a Serviced Loan Combination, the related Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders in such manner as will be reasonably likely to realize a fair price within the time period provided for by Section 3.15(a) of this Agreement.  The Special Servicer (with the consent of the Directing Holder) shall accept the first (and, if multiple offers are contemporaneously received, highest) cash offer received from any Person that constitutes a fair price for such Serviced REO Property.  If the Special Servicer determines, in its good faith and reasonable judgment, that it will be unable to realize a fair price for any Serviced REO Property within the time constraints imposed by Section 3.15(a) of this Agreement, then the Special Servicer (with the consent of the Directing Holder) shall dispose of such Serviced REO Property upon such terms and conditions as the Special Servicer shall deem necessary and desirable to maximize the recovery thereon under the circumstances and, in connection therewith, shall accept the highest outstanding cash offer, regardless of from whom received.



 The Special Servicer shall give the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator, the Master Servicer, the Operating Advisor and the Directing Holder, not less than ten Business Days' prior written notice of its intention to sell any Serviced REO Property, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, neither the Trustee, in its individual capacity, nor any of its Affiliates may make an offer for or purchase any Serviced REO Property pursuant to this Agreement.



 (h)           Whether any cash offer constitutes a fair price for any Serviced REO Property, as the case may be, shall be determined by the Special Servicer, if the highest offeror is a Person other than an Interested Person, and by the Trustee, if the highest offeror is an Interested Person; provided, that no offer from an Interested Person shall constitute a fair price unless it is the highest offer received.  In determining whether any offer received from an Interested Person represents a fair price for any such Serviced REO Property, the Trustee shall be supplied with and shall rely on the most recent appraisal or Updated Appraisal conducted in accordance with this Agreement within the preceding 9-month period or in the absence of any such appraisal, on a narrative appraisal prepared by an Independent MAI Appraiser selected by the Special Servicer if the Special Servicer or an Affiliate of the Special Servicer is not making an offer with respect to a Serviced REO Property (or by the Master Servicer if the Special Servicer is making such an offer).  The cost of any such Updated Appraisal or narrative appraisal and any related costs and fees of the Trustee shall be covered by, and shall be reimbursable as, a Property Advance.  In determining whether any offer from a Person other than an Interested Person constitutes a fair price for any such Serviced REO Property, the Special Servicer shall take into account (in addition to the results of any appraisal, updated appraisal or narrative







 appraisal that it may have obtained pursuant to this Agreement within the prior 9 months), and in determining whether any offer from an Interested Person constitutes a fair price for any such Serviced REO Property, any appraiser shall be instructed to take into account, as applicable, among other factors, the period and amount of the occupancy level and physical condition of the Mortgaged Property or Serviced REO Property, the state of the local economy and the obligation to dispose of any Serviced REO Property within the time period specified in Section 3.15(a) of this Agreement.  The Repurchase Price (which, in connection with the administration of a Serviced REO Property related to a Serviced Loan Combination, shall be construed and calculated as if the loans in such Serviced Loan Combination together constitute a single Mortgage Loan thereunder) for any Serviced REO Property shall in all cases be deemed a fair price.



 (i)           Subject to subsections (g) and (h) above, the Special Servicer shall act on behalf of the Trustee (for the benefit of the Certificateholders and, in the case of a Serviced Loan Combination, the related Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders) in negotiating and taking any other action necessary or appropriate in connection with the sale of any Serviced REO Property, and the applicable collection of all amounts payable in connection therewith.  In connection therewith, the Special Servicer may charge for its own account prospective offerors, and may retain, fees that approximate the Special Servicer's actual costs in the preparation and delivery of information pertaining to such sales or exchanging offers without obligation to deposit such amounts into the Collection Account or, in the case of any Serviced Loan Combination, the applicable Serviced Loan Combination Collection Account.  Any sale of a Serviced REO Property shall be final and without recourse to the Trustee or the Trust Fund (except such recourse to the Trust Fund imposed by those representations and warranties typically given in such transactions, any prorations applied thereto and any customary closing matters), and if such sale is consummated in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, none of the Special Servicer, the Master Servicer, the Depositor or the Trustee shall have any liability to any Certificateholder or Serviced Companion Loan Noteholder with respect to the purchase price therefor accepted by the Special Servicer or the Trustee.



 (j)           Any sale of a Serviced REO Property shall be for cash only.



 (k)           Notwithstanding any of the foregoing paragraphs of this Section 3.16, the Special Servicer shall not be obligated to accept the highest cash offer if the Special Servicer determines, in its reasonable and good faith judgment, that rejection of such offer would be in the best interests of the Certificateholders and, in the case of a Serviced Loan Combination, the related Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders (as a collective whole as if such Certificateholders and, if applicable, Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders constituted a single lender), and the Special Servicer may accept a lower cash offer (from any Person other than itself or an Affiliate) if it determines, in its reasonable and good faith judgment, that acceptance of such offer would be in the best interests of the Certificateholders (for example, if the prospective buyer making the lower offer is more likely to perform its obligations or the terms offered by the prospective buyer making the lower offer are more favorable) and, in the case of a Serviced Loan Combination, the related Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders (as a collective whole as if such Certificateholders and, if applicable, Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders) constituted a single lender.







 (l)           With respect to each defaulted Serviced Companion Loan other than the Miracle Mile Shops Companion Loan, the Special Servicer shall have the right (but not the obligation) to sell such defaulted Serviced Companion Loan together with the related Mortgage Loan and, with respect to the Miracle Mile Shops Companion Loans, if the Special Servicer determines to sell the Miracle Mile Shops Mortgage Loan, it shall sell each Miracle Mile Shops Companion Loan together with the related Mortgage Loan pursuant to the terms of the related Intercreditor Agreement as if such Mortgage Loan and Serviced Companion Loan were one whole loan on behalf of the Certificateholders and the related Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders.  The Special Servicer shall provide notice to the applicable Other Special Servicer (if any) as soon as practicable following its decision to attempt to sell, and prior to the commencement or marketing of, any Serviced Companion Loan.



 Section 3.17       Additional Obligations of the Master Servicer and the Special Servicer; Inspections.  (a)  The Master Servicer (at its own expense) (or, with respect to Specially Serviced Loans and Serviced REO Properties, the Special Servicer) shall inspect or cause to be inspected each Mortgaged Property securing a Mortgage Loan (other than a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan) that it is servicing at such times and in such manner as is consistent with the Servicing Standard, but in any event shall inspect each Mortgaged Property with a Stated Principal Balance (or in the case of a Mortgage Loan secured by more than one Mortgaged Property, having an Allocated Loan Amount) of (A) $2,000,000 or more at least once every 12 months, commencing in 2014 and (B) less than $2,000,000 at least once every 24 months, commencing in 2015 (or at such decreased frequency as each Rating Agency shall have provided a No Downgrade Confirmation relating to the Certificates and Serviced Companion Loan Securities, if any); provided, that if any Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination becomes a Specially Serviced Loan, the Special Servicer is required to inspect or cause to be inspected the related Mortgaged Property as soon as practicable after the Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination becomes a Specially Serviced Loan; provided, further, that the Master Servicer will not be required to inspect a Mortgaged Property that has been inspected in the previous six months.  The reasonable cost of each such inspection performed in accordance with the Servicing Standard by the Special Servicer shall be paid by the Master Servicer as a Property Advance; provided, that if such Advance would be a Nonrecoverable Advance, then the cost of such inspections shall be an expense of the Trust payable out of general collections.  With respect to a Serviced Loan Combination, the costs described in the preceding sentence above that relate to the applicable Serviced Loan Combination shall be paid out of amounts on deposit in the Serviced Loan Combination Collection Account related to such Serviced Loan Combination (allocated in accordance with the expense allocation provision of the related Intercreditor Agreement).  If funds in the applicable Serviced Loan Combination Collection Account relating to a Serviced Loan Combination are insufficient, then any deficiency shall be paid from amounts on deposit in the Collection Account; provided that the Master Servicer shall, after receiving payment from amounts on deposit in the Collection Account, if any, (i) promptly notify the related Companion Loan Noteholder and (ii) use commercially reasonable efforts to exercise on behalf of the Trust any rights under the related Intercreditor Agreement to obtain reimbursement for a pro rata portion of such amount allocable to the related Serviced Companion Loans from the related Companion Loan Noteholders.  The Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as applicable, shall prepare a written report of the inspection describing, among other things, the condition of and any damage to the Mortgaged Property securing a Mortgage Loan that it is servicing and specifying the existence of any material vacancies in such Mortgaged Property,







 any sale, transfer or abandonment of such Mortgaged Property of which it has actual knowledge, any material adverse change in the condition of the Mortgaged Property, or any visible material waste committed on applicable Mortgaged Property.  The Master Servicer or Special Servicer, as applicable, shall send such reports to the 17g-5 Information Provider (who shall promptly post such reports to the 17g-5 Information Provider's Website pursuant to Section 3.14(d) of this Agreement), the related Other 17g-5 Information Provider (if applicable), and, upon request, to the Underwriters within 20 days of completion of the inspection report, each inspection report.



 (b)           With respect to each Mortgage Loan (other than a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan) or Serviced Loan Combination, as applicable, the Master Servicer (or the Special Servicer, in the case of a Specially Serviced Loan) shall exercise the Trustee's rights, in accordance with the Servicing Standard, with respect to the Manager under the related Loan Documents and Management Agreement, if any.



 (c)           With respect to any Mortgage Loan (other than a Specially Serviced Loan, a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan or a previously Specially Serviced Loan with respect to which the Special Servicer has waived or amended the prepayment restrictions such that the related Borrower is not required to prepay on a Due Date or pay interest that would have accrued on the amount prepaid through and including the last day of the interest accrual period occurring following the date of such prepayment) or Serviced Companion Loan for which the Master Servicer has accepted a voluntary Principal Prepayment (other than (A) in accordance with the terms of the related Loan Documents, (B) in connection with the payment of insurance proceeds or condemnation proceeds, (C) subsequent to a default under the related Loan Documents (provided that the Master Servicer reasonably believes that acceptance of such prepayment is consistent with the Servicing Standard), (D) pursuant to applicable law or a court order, or (E) at the request of or with the consent of the Special Servicer or, for so long as no Control Termination Event has occurred and is continuing, the Directing Holder) resulting in a Prepayment Interest Shortfall, the Master Servicer shall deliver to the Certificate Administrator on each Servicer Remittance Date for deposit in the Lower-Tier Distribution Account (or, in the case of a Prepayment Interest Shortfall with respect to a Serviced Companion Loan, remit to the holder of the Serviced Companion Loan a pro rata portion of the following amount), without any right of reimbursement therefor, a cash payment (a "Master Servicer Prepayment Interest Shortfall Amount"), in an amount equal to the lesser of (x) the aggregate amount of Prepayment Interest Shortfalls incurred in connection with such voluntary Principal Prepayments received in respect of the Mortgage Loans or Serviced Loan Combinations serviced by it during the related Collection Period, and (y) the aggregate of (A) that portion of its Master Servicing Fees (calculated for this purpose at three basis points (0.03%)) that is being paid in such Collection Period with respect to the Mortgage Loans and Serviced Loan Combinations (other than a Specially Serviced Loan or a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan) and (B) all Prepayment Interest Excess received during the related Collection Period on the Mortgage Loans and Serviced Loan Combinations (other than a Specially Serviced Loan or a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan) serviced by the Master Servicer; provided that if any Prepayment Interest Shortfall occurs as a result of the Master Servicer's failure to enforce the related Mortgage Loan Documents (other than in connection with (a) a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan, (b) a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan, (c) a previously Specially Serviced Loan with respect to which the Special Servicer has waived or amended the prepayment restriction such that the related Borrower is not required to prepay on a Due Date or pay interest that would have accrued on the amount prepaid through and including







 the last day of the interest accrual period occurring following the date of such prepayment or (d) the circumstances covered in clauses (A), (B), (C), (D) or (E) above), the Master Servicer will be required to pay an amount equal to the entire Prepayment Interest Shortfall with respect to that Mortgage Loan.  The Master Servicer's obligations to pay any Master Servicer Prepayment Interest Shortfall Amount, and the rights of the Certificateholders to offset of the aggregate Prepayment Interest Shortfalls against those amounts, shall not be cumulative.



 (d)           The Master Servicer shall, as to each Mortgage Loan (other than a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan) or Serviced Loan Combination that is secured by the interest of the related Borrower under a ground lease, promptly (and in any event within 60 days) after the Closing Date notify the related ground lessor of the transfer of such Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination to the Trust pursuant to this Agreement and inform such ground lessor that any notices of default under the related Ground Lease should thereafter be forwarded to the Master Servicer.



 (e)           The Master Servicer shall, to the extent consistent with the Servicing Standard and permitted by the related Loan Documents, not apply any funds with respect to a Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination (whether arising in the form of a holdback, earnout reserve, cash trap or other similar feature) to the prepayment of the related Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination prior to an event of default or reasonably foreseeable event of default with respect to such Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination.  Prior to an event of default or reasonably foreseeable event of default any such amounts described in the immediately preceding sentence shall be held by the Master Servicer as additional collateral for the related Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination.

The Certificate Administrator may at any time terminate the agency of the Authenticating Agent by giving written notice of termination to the Authenticating Agent, the Depositor and the Master Servicer.  Upon receiving a notice of resignation or upon such a termination, or in case at any time the Authenticating Agent shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section 3.18, the Certificate Administrator may appoint a







 successor Authenticating Agent, which shall be acceptable to the Depositor, and shall mail notice of such appointment to all Certificateholders.  Any successor Authenticating Agent upon acceptance of its appointment hereunder shall become vested with all the rights, powers, duties and responsibilities of its predecessor hereunder, with like effect as if originally named as Authenticating Agent herein.  No successor Authenticating Agent shall be appointed unless eligible under the provisions of this Section 3.18.



 The Authenticating Agent shall have no responsibility or liability for any action taken by it as such at the direction of the Certificate Administrator.  Any compensation paid to the Authenticating Agent shall be an unreimbursable expense of the Certificate Administrator, as applicable.



 Section 3.19      Appointment of Custodians.  The Certificate Administrator shall be the initial Custodian hereunder.  The Certificate Administrator may appoint one or more additional Custodians to hold all or a portion of the Mortgage Files on behalf of the Trustee and otherwise perform the duties set forth in Article II, by entering into a Custodial Agreement with any Custodian who is not the Depositor.  The Certificate Administrator agrees to comply with the terms of each Custodial Agreement and to enforce the terms and provisions thereof against the Custodian for the benefit of the Certificateholders.

If the Custodian is an entity other than the Certificate Administrator, the Custodian shall maintain a fidelity bond in the form and amount that are customary for securitizations similar to the securitization evidenced by this Agreement.  The Custodian shall be deemed to have complied with this provision if one of its Affiliates has such fidelity bond coverage and, by the terms of such fidelity bond, the coverage afforded thereunder extends to the Custodian.  In addition, the Custodian shall keep in force during the term of this Agreement a policy or policies of insurance covering loss occasioned by the errors and omissions of its officers and employees in connection with its obligations hereunder in the form and amount that are customary for securitizations similar to the securitization evidenced by this Agreement.

 Section 3.20     Lock-Box Accounts, Cash Collateral Accounts, Escrow Accounts and Reserve Accounts.  The Master Servicer shall administer each Lock-Box Account, Cash Collateral Account, Escrow Account and Reserve Account in accordance with the related Mortgage or Loan Agreement, Cash Collateral Account Agreement or Lock-Box Agreement, if any relating to the Mortgage Loans (other than a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan) or Serviced Loan Combinations it is servicing.



 Section 3.21      Property Advances.  (a)  The Master Servicer (or, to the extent provided in Section 3.21(c) of this Agreement, the Trustee) to the extent specifically provided for in this Agreement, shall make any Property Advances as and to the extent otherwise required pursuant to the terms hereof with respect to the Mortgage Loans (other than Non-Serviced Mortgage Loans) or Serviced Loan Combinations that it is servicing.  For purposes







 of distributions to Certificateholders and compensation to the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer or the Trustee, Property Advances shall not be considered to increase the Stated Principal Balance of any such Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination, notwithstanding that the terms of such Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination so provide.



 (b)           Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Special Servicer shall give the Master Servicer not less than five Business Days' written notice with respect to any Property Advance to be made on any Specially Serviced Loan, before the date on which the Master Servicer is required to make such Property Advance with respect to such Specially Serviced Loan or Serviced REO Loan; provided, that the Special Servicer shall be required to provide the Master Servicer with only two Business Days' written notice in respect of Property Advances required to be made on an urgent or emergency basis (which may include, without limitation, Property Advances required to make tax or insurance payments).  If the Master Servicer or the Trustee makes a Property Advance with respect to any Serviced Loan Combination, then it shall provide written notice to the related Other Servicer, Other Special Servicer and Other Trustee of the amount of such Property Advance with respect to such Serviced Loan Combination within two (2) Business Days of making such Property Advance.



 (c)           The Master Servicer shall notify the Trustee and the Certificate Administrator in writing promptly upon, and in any event within one Business Day after, becoming aware that it will be unable to make any Property Advance required to be made pursuant to the terms hereof, and in connection therewith, shall set forth in such notice the amount of such Property Advance, the Person to whom it is to be paid, and the circumstances and purpose of such Property Advance, and shall set forth therein information and instructions for the payment of such Property Advance, and, on the date specified in such notice for the payment of such Property Advance, or, if the date for payment has passed or if no such date is specified, then within five Business Days following such notice, the Trustee, subject to the provisions of Section 3.21(d) of this Agreement, shall pay the amount of such Property Advance in accordance with such information and instructions.



 (d)           The Special Servicer shall promptly furnish any party required to make Property Advances hereunder with any information in its possession regarding the Specially Serviced Loans and REO Properties as such party required to make Property Advances may reasonably request for purposes of making recoverability determinations.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Special Servicer shall have no obligation to make an affirmative determination that any Advance is, or would be, a Nonrecoverable Advance, and in the absence of a determination by the Special Servicer that such an Advance is a Nonrecoverable Advance, then all such decisions shall remain with the Master Servicer or Trustee, as applicable.



 Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no Property Advance shall be required hereunder if the Person otherwise required to make such Property Advance determines that such Property Advance would, if made, constitute a Nonrecoverable Property Advance.  In addition, the Master Servicer shall not make any Property Advance to the extent that it has received written notice that the Special Servicer has determined (if no Consultation Termination Event has occurred and is continuing, in consultation with the Directing Holder) that such Property Advance would, if made, constitute a Nonrecoverable Property Advance.  In making such recoverability determination, such Person will be entitled to (i) give due regard to the







 existence of any Nonrecoverable Advance or Workout-Delayed Reimbursement Amount with respect to other Mortgage Loans, the recovery of which, at the time of such consideration, is being deferred or delayed by the Master Servicer or the Trustee, as applicable, in light of the fact that proceeds on the related Mortgage Loan (or the related Serviced Loan Combination, as applicable) are a source of recovery not only for the Property Advance under consideration, but also as a potential source of recovery of such Nonrecoverable Advance or Workout-Delayed Reimbursement Amount which is being or may be deferred or delayed and (ii) consider (among other things) the obligations of the Borrower under the terms of the related Mortgage Loan (or the related Serviced Loan Combination, as applicable) as it may have been modified, (iii) consider (among other things) the related Mortgaged Properties in their "as is" or then current conditions and occupancies, as modified by such party's assumptions (consistent with the Servicing Standard in the case of the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer) regarding the possibility and effects of future adverse changes with respect to such Mortgaged Properties, (iv) estimate and consider (consistent with the Servicing Standard in the case of the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer) (among other things) future expenses and (v) estimate and consider (among other things) the timing of recoveries.



 The Master Servicer, the Special Servicer and the Trustee, as applicable, shall consider Unliquidated Advances in respect of prior Property Advances for purposes of nonrecoverability determinations as if such Unliquidated Advances were unreimbursed Property Advances.  If an Appraisal of the related Mortgaged Property shall not have been obtained within the prior 9 month period (and the Master Servicer and the Trustee shall each request any such appraisal from the Special Servicer prior to ordering an Appraisal pursuant to this sentence) or if such an Appraisal shall have been obtained but as a result of unforeseen occurrences, such Appraisal does not, in the good faith determination of the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer or the Trustee, reflect current market conditions, and the Master Servicer or the Trustee, as applicable, and the Special Servicer cannot agree on the appropriate downward adjustment to such Appraisal, the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer or the Trustee, as the case may be, may, subject to its reasonable and good faith determination that such Appraisal will demonstrate the nonrecoverability of the related Advance, obtain an Appraisal for such purpose at the expense of the Trust Fund (and, in the case of any Serviced Loan Combination, such expense shall be allocated in accordance with the allocation provisions of the related Intercreditor Agreement).



 Any determination by the Master Servicer, Special Servicer or the Trustee that the Master Servicer or Trustee, as the case may be, has made a Property Advance that is a Nonrecoverable Property Advance or any determination by the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer or the Trustee that any proposed Property Advance, if made, would constitute a Nonrecoverable Property Advance shall be evidenced in the case of the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer by a certificate of a Servicing Officer delivered to the other, to the Trustee, the Directing Holder (but only if no Consultation Termination Event has occurred and is continuing), the Operating Advisor, the Certificate Administrator and the Depositor and, in the case of the Trustee, by a certificate of a Responsible Officer of the Trustee, delivered to the Depositor, the Directing Holder (but only if no Consultation Termination Event has occurred and is continuing), the Operating Advisor, the Certificate Administrator, the Master Servicer and the Special Servicer, which in each case sets forth such nonrecoverability determination and the considerations of the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer or the Trustee, as applicable, forming







 the basis of such determination (such certificate accompanied by, to the extent available, income and expense statements, rent rolls, occupancy status, property inspections and other information used by the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer or the Trustee, as applicable, to make such determination, together with any existing Appraisal or any Updated Appraisal); provided, that the Special Servicer may, at its option, make a determination in accordance with the Servicing Standard, that any Property Advance previously made or proposed to be made is nonrecoverable and shall deliver to the Master Servicer, the Certificate Administrator, the Directing Holder (but only if no Consultation Termination Event has occurred and is continuing), the Operating Advisor, the Trustee, the related Serviced Companion Loan Noteholder (if any) and the 17g-5 Information Provider (who shall promptly post such notice to the 17g-5 Information Provider's Website pursuant to Section 3.14(d) of this Agreement) notice of such determination.  Any such determination shall be conclusive and binding on the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer and the Trustee.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Special Servicer shall have no obligation to make an affirmative determination that any Advance is, or would be, a Nonrecoverable Advance, and in the absence of a determination by the Special Servicer that such an Advance is a Nonrecoverable Advance, then all such decisions shall remain with the Master Servicer.



 Any such Person may update or change its recoverability determinations at any time (but not reverse any other Person's determination that a Property Advance is a Nonrecoverable Advance) and (consistent with the Servicing Standard in the case of the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer) may obtain, at the expense of the Trust (and, in the case of a Serviced Loan Combination, such expense shall be allocated in accordance with the allocation provisions of the related Intercreditor Agreement), any analysis, Appraisals or market value estimates or other information for such purposes.  Absent bad faith, any such determination as to the recoverability of any Property Advance shall be conclusive and binding on the Certificateholders and the Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders.



 Notwithstanding the above, the Trustee and the Certificate Administrator shall be entitled to rely conclusively on any determination by the Master Servicer and the Master Servicer, the Trustee and the Certificate Administrator shall be bound by any determination of the Special Servicer that a Property Advance, if made, would be a Nonrecoverable Property Advance.  The Trustee, in determining whether or not a Property Advance previously made is, or a proposed Property Advance, if made, would be, a Nonrecoverable Property Advance shall be subject to the standards applicable to the Master Servicer hereunder.



 With respect to the payment of insurance premiums and delinquent tax assessments, if the Master Servicer determines that a Property Advance of such amounts would constitute a Nonrecoverable Advance, the Master Servicer shall deliver notice of such determination to the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator and the Special Servicer.  Upon receipt of such notice, the Master Servicer (with respect to any Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination that is not a Specially Serviced Loan) and the Special Servicer (with respect to any Specially Serviced Loan or REO Property) shall determine (with the reasonable assistance of the Master Servicer) whether the payment of such amount (i) is necessary to preserve the related Mortgaged Property and (ii) would be in the best interests of the Certificateholders and, in the case of any Serviced Companion Loans, the related Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders (as a collective whole as if such Certificateholders and, if applicable, Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders constituted a single lender).  If the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer







 determines that the payment of such amount (i) is necessary to preserve the related Mortgaged Property and (ii) would be in the best interests of the Certificateholders and, in the case of any Serviced Companion Loan, the related Serviced Companion Loan Noteholder, the Special Servicer (in the case of a determination by the Special Servicer) shall direct the Master Servicer in writing to make such payment and the Master Servicer shall make such payment, to the extent of available funds, from amounts in the Collection Account or, if a Serviced Loan Combination is involved, from amounts in the applicable Serviced Loan Combination Collection Account.



 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 3.21, the Master Servicer may elect (but shall not be required) to make a payment out of the Collection Account to pay for certain expenses specified in this sentence notwithstanding that the Master Servicer has determined that a Property Advance with respect to such expenditure would be a Nonrecoverable Property Advance (unless, with respect to Specially Serviced Loans or Serviced REO Loans, the Special Servicer has notified the Master Servicer to not make such expenditure), where making such expenditure would prevent (i) the related Mortgaged Property from being uninsured or being sold at a tax sale or (ii) any event that would cause a loss of the priority of the lien of the related Mortgage, or the loss of any security for the related Mortgage Loan; provided that in each instance, the Master Servicer determines in accordance with the Servicing Standard (as evidenced by a certificate of a Servicing Officer delivered to the Trustee and the Certificate Administrator) that making such expenditure is in the best interests of the Certificateholders and, in the case of a Serviced Loan Combination, the related Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders (as a collective whole as if such Certificateholders and, if applicable, Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders constituted a single lender).  The Master Servicer may elect to obtain reimbursement of Nonrecoverable Property Advances from the Trust Fund in accordance with Section 3.06 of this Agreement.



 (e)           The Master Servicer and/or the Trustee, as applicable, shall be entitled to the reimbursement of Property Advances made by any of them to the extent permitted pursuant to Section 3.06 of this Agreement, if applicable, of this Agreement, together with any related Advance Interest Amount in respect of such Property Advances, and the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer and the Trustee each hereby covenants and agrees to promptly seek and effect the reimbursement of such Property Advances from the related Borrowers to the extent permitted by applicable law and the related Loan Documents.



 The parties acknowledge that, pursuant to the applicable Other Pooling and Servicing Agreement, the applicable Other Servicer is obligated to make property advances with respect to the related Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan.

 The Special Servicer shall have the authority to meet with the Borrower for any Specially Serviced Loan and take such actions consistent with the Servicing Standard and the related Asset Status Report.

This determination shall be made pursuant to the Operating Advisor Standard.  The Special Servicer shall consider any such proposals from the Operating Advisor and determine whether any changes to its proposed Asset Status Report should be made, such determination being made in accordance with the Servicing Standard and the other terms of this Agreement.

 (b)           The Master Servicer shall send written notice to each Borrower (other than with respect to a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan) and the related Manager and clearing bank relating to a Mortgage Loan (other than any Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan) that it is servicing that, if applicable, it and/or the Trustee has been appointed as the "Designee" of the "Lender" under any related Lock-Box Agreement.



 (c)           Without limiting the obligations of the Master Servicer hereunder with respect to the enforcement of a Borrower's obligations under the related Loan Documents, the Master Servicer agrees that it shall, in accordance with the Servicing Standard, enforce the provisions of the Loan Documents relating to the Mortgage Loans (other than Non-Serviced Mortgage Loans) that it is servicing with respect to the collection of Prepayment Premiums and Yield Maintenance Charges.



 (d)           If a Rating Agency shall charge a fee in connection with providing a No Downgrade Confirmation, the Master Servicer shall require the related Borrower (other than with respect to a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan) to pay such fee to the extent not inconsistent







 with the applicable Loan Documents.  If such fee remains unpaid, such fee shall be an expense of the Trust Fund (allocated as an Additional Trust Fund Expense in the same manner as Realized Losses as set forth in Section 4.01(f) of this Agreement) and, in the case of a Serviced Loan Combination with a Serviced Companion Loan, allocated in accordance with the allocation provisions of the related Intercreditor Agreement, the costs of which may be advanced as a Property Advance.



 (e)           The Master Servicer shall, in accordance with the Servicing Standard, enforce the right of the Trust to recover any amounts owed by the Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders to the Trust Fund pursuant to the related Intercreditor Agreement.  The cost of such enforcement on behalf of the Trust shall be paid and reimbursable as a Property Advance.



 (f)           With respect to a Mortgage Loan (other than a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan) or Serviced Loan Combination with a Stated Principal Balance equal to or greater than the lesser of 5% of the Stated Principal Balance of all Mortgage Loans held by the Trust Fund and $35,000,000, or with respect to any Mortgage Loan that is one of the ten largest Mortgage Loans based on Stated Principal Balance, to the extent not inconsistent with the related Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination, the Master Servicer shall not consent to a change of franchise affiliation with respect to a Mortgaged Property (other than a Mortgaged Property securing a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan) serviced hereunder or the property manager with respect to a Mortgaged Property (other than a Mortgaged Property securing a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan) serviced hereunder unless the Master Servicer obtains a No Downgrade Confirmation relating to the Certificates and Serviced Companion Loan Securities, if any.



 (g)           With respect to certain Mortgage Loans originated or acquired by GACC and subject to defeasance, GACC has transferred to a third party, the right to establish or designate the successor borrower and to purchase or cause to be purchased the related defeasance collateral ("GACC Defeasance Rights and Obligations").  If the Master Servicer receives notice of a defeasance request with respect to a Mortgage Loan (other than a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan) that provides for GACC Defeasance Rights and Obligations, the Master Servicer shall provide, upon receipt of such notice, written notice of such defeasance request to GACC or its assignee.  Until such time as GACC provides written notice to the contrary, notice of a defeasance of a Mortgage Loan with GACC Defeasance Rights and Obligations shall be delivered to CDHC, LLC, c/o Defeasance Holding Company, LLC, 11121 Carmel Commons Blvd., Suite 250, Charlotte, North Carolina 28226, Attention:  Legal Department, Tel:  (704) 731-6252; Fax:  (704) 759-9156.  If the successor borrower is not designated or formed by CDHC, LLC or any affiliate or successor thereto, the successor borrower shall be reasonably acceptable to the Master Servicer in accordance with the Servicing Standard.



 Section 3.25       Certain Rights and Obligations of the Master Servicer and/or the Special Servicer.  (a)  In addition to its rights and obligations with respect to Specially Serviced Loans, the Special Servicer has the right, whether or not the applicable Mortgage Loan (other than a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan) is a Specially Serviced Loan, to process or approve (i) certain modifications to the extent described under Section 3.26 of this Agreement and (ii) certain waivers of due-on-sale or due-on-encumbrance clauses as described above under Section 3.09 of this Agreement.  With respect to Performing Loans (other than Non-Serviced Mortgage Loans), the Master Servicer shall notify the Special Servicer of any request for approval (a "Request for Approval") received relating to the Special Servicer's above-referenced







 processing or approval rights and, unless the Special Servicer and the Master Servicer mutually agree that the Master Servicer shall process such request, the Master Servicer shall take no further action, and shall have no obligation to take any further action other than to cooperate with the Special Servicer to the extent required pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, with respect to such borrower request.  If the Special Servicer and the Master Servicer mutually agree that the Master Servicer shall process such borrower request, the Master Servicer shall prepare and forward to the Special Servicer its written recommendation and analysis and any other information or documents reasonably requested by the Special Servicer (to the extent such information or documents are in the Master Servicer's possession).  Subject to Section 3.09(h) of this Agreement, the Special Servicer shall have 15 Business Days (from the date that the Special Servicer receives the information it requested from the Master Servicer) to analyze and make a recommendation with respect to a Request for Approval with respect to a Performing Loan and, prior to the end of such 15 Business Day period, for so long as no Control Termination Event has occurred and is continuing, is required to notify the Directing Holder and each Serviced Companion Loan Noteholder of such Request for Approval and its recommendation with respect thereto.  Following such notice, the Directing Holder shall have 10 Business Days from the date it receives the Special Servicer recommendation and any other information it may reasonably request (or, with respect to any Serviced Loan Combination, such longer time period as may be provided in the related Intercreditor Agreement) to approve any recommendation of the Special Servicer relating to any Request for Approval.  In any event, if the Directing Holder does not respond to a Request for Approval by 5 pxxPDmxxPD on the 10th Business Day after such request, the Special Servicer or the Master Servicer, as applicable, may deem its recommendation approved by the Directing Holder and if the Special Servicer does not respond to a Request for Approval within the required 15 Business Days (or such longer time period pursuant to the terms of the related Intercreditor Agreement but not less than five (5) Business Days after the time period set forth therein for Directing Holder approval), the Master Servicer may deem its recommendation approved by the Special Servicer.  With respect to a Specially Serviced Loan, the Special Servicer must notify the Directing Holder of any Request for Approval received relating to the Directing Holder's above-referenced approval rights and its recommendation with respect thereto.  The Directing Holder shall have 10 Business Days (after receipt of all information reasonably requested) to approve any recommendation of the Special Servicer relating to any such Request for Approval.  In any event, if the Directing Holder does not respond to any such Request for Approval by 5 pxxPDmxxPD on the 10th Business Day after such request, the Special Servicer may deem its recommendation approved by the Directing Holder.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) with respect to any Loan Combination, the procedure and timing for approval by the Directing Holder (to the extent it is the related Companion Loan Noteholder) of the related Request for Approval shall be governed by the terms of the related Intercreditor Agreement and (ii) if the Special Servicer determines that immediate action is necessary to protect the interests of the Certificateholders and, with respect to any Serviced Loan Combination, the Certificateholders and the related Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders (as a collective whole as if such Certificateholders and, if applicable, Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders constituted a single lender) and the Special Servicer has made a reasonable effort to contact the Directing Holder, it need not wait for a response from the Directing Holder.



 (b)           Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, neither the Master Servicer nor the Special Servicer shall be required to take or refrain from taking any action pursuant to instructions from the Directing Holder, or due to any failure to approve an action by







 the Directing Holder, or due to any objection by the Directing Holder that would (i) cause any one of them to violate applicable law, the terms of any Loan Documents, any Intercreditor Agreement, this Agreement, including the Servicing Standard, or the REMIC Provisions or (ii) (A) expose the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Depositor, a Mortgage Loan Seller, the Trust Fund, the Operating Advisor, the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator or their respective Affiliates, officers, directors, employees or agents to any claim, suit or liability, (B) materially expand the scope of the Master Servicer's or the Special Servicer's responsibilities, or (C) cause the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer to act, or fail to act, in a manner that is not in the best interests of the Certificateholders.



 (c)           The Master Servicer and the Special Servicer, as applicable, shall discuss with the Directing Holder, on a monthly basis, the performance of any Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination that is a Specially Serviced Loan, which is delinquent, has been placed on a "Watch List" or has been identified by the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer as exhibiting deteriorating performance.



 Section 3.26       Modification, Waiver, Amendment and Consents.  (a)  Subject to Section 3.25, Section 3.26(f) and Section 3.27, and, if applicable, each Intercreditor Agreement, (i) the Master Servicer (subject to the Special Servicer's processing and/or consent as set forth in clause (m), except as provided in clause (n)) or (ii) with respect to any Specially Serviced Loan, the Special Servicer, in each case subject to the rights of the Directing Holder and consultation with the Operating Advisor (if no Control Termination Event has occurred and is continuing and to the extent the Operating Advisor has consultation rights pursuant to Section 3.23(e), Section 3.31 and Section 6.07 of this Agreement), may modify, waive or amend any term of any Mortgage Loan (other than any Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan) or Serviced Loan Combination if such modification, waiver or amendment (A) is consistent with the Servicing Standard and (B) would not constitute a "significant modification" of such Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section 1.860G-2(b) and would not otherwise (1) cause either Trust REMIC to fail to qualify as a REMIC or (2) result in the imposition of a tax upon either Trust REMIC or the Trust Fund (including but not limited to the tax on "prohibited transactions" as defined in Section 860F(a)(2) of the Code and the tax on contributions to a REMIC set forth in Section 860G(d) of the Code, but not including the tax on "net income from foreclosure property" under Section 860G(c) of the Code).  In connection with (i) the release of a Mortgaged Property or any portion of a Mortgaged Property from the lien of the related Mortgage or (ii) the taking of a Mortgaged Property or any portion of a Mortgaged Property by exercise of the power of eminent domain or condemnation, if the Loan Documents require the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as applicable, to calculate (or to approve the calculation of the related Borrower of) the loan-to-value ratio of the remaining Mortgaged Property or Mortgaged Properties or the fair market value of the real property constituting the remaining Mortgaged Property or Mortgaged Properties, for purposes of REMIC qualification of the related Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination, then such calculation shall exclude the value of any personal property and going concern value, if any.



 (b)           Neither the Master Servicer nor the Special Servicer may extend the Maturity Date of any Mortgage Loan, Serviced Loan Combination or Specially Serviced Loan beyond the date that is the date occurring later than the earlier of (1) five years prior to the Rated Final Distribution Date and (2) in the case of a Mortgage Loan, Serviced Loan Combination or







 Specially Serviced Loan secured solely or primarily by the related Borrower's interest in a ground lease, the date that is 20 years prior to the expiration date of such ground lease (or 10 years prior to the expiration date of such lease if the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as applicable gives due consideration to the remaining term of such ground lease and such extension is in the best interest of the Certificateholders and, with respect to a Serviced Loan Combination, the related Serviced Companion Loan Noteholder (as a collective whole as if such Certificateholders and (with respect to a Serviced Loan Combination) Serviced Companion Loan Noteholder constituted a single lender) and, if no Control Termination Event has occurred and is continuing, with the consent of the Directing Holder).



 (c)           Neither the Master Servicer nor the Special Servicer shall permit any Borrower to add or substitute any collateral for an outstanding Mortgage Loan (other than a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan) or Serviced Loan Combination, which collateral constitutes real property, unless the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as applicable, shall have obtained a No Downgrade Confirmation relating to the Certificates and Serviced Companion Loan Securities, if any.



 (d)           Any payment of interest, which is deferred pursuant to any modification, waiver or amendment permitted hereunder, shall not, for purposes hereof, including, without limitation, calculating monthly distributions to Certificateholders or, if applicable, Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders, be added to the unpaid principal balance of the related Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination, notwithstanding that the terms of such Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination or such modification, waiver or amendment so permit.



 (e)           Except for waivers of Penalty Charges and waivers of notice periods, all material modifications, waivers and amendments of the Mortgage Loans (other than a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan) or Serviced Loan Combinations in accordance with this Section 3.26 or in Section 3.27 of this Agreement (with respect to Serviced Loan Combinations) shall be in writing.



 (f)           The Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as applicable, shall notify the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator, the Directing Holder (other than if a Consultation Termination Event has occurred and is continuing), the Operating Advisor (only if a Control Termination Event has occurred and is continuing), the Depositor, the related Serviced Companion Loan Noteholder (if applicable) and the 17g-5 Information Provider (who shall promptly post such notice to the 17g-5 Information Provider's Website pursuant to Section 3.14(d) of this Agreement), in writing, of any modification, waiver, material consent or amendment of any term of any Mortgage Loan (other than a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan) or Serviced Loan Combination and the date thereof, and shall deliver to the Custodian for deposit in the related Mortgage File, an original counterpart of the agreement relating to such modification, waiver, material consent or amendment, promptly (and in any event within 10 Business Days) following the execution thereof.



 (g)           The Master Servicer or the Special Servicer may (subject to the Servicing Standard), as a condition to granting any request by a Borrower for consent, modification, waiver or indulgence or any other matter or thing, the granting of which is within its discretion pursuant to the terms of the instruments evidencing or securing the related Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination and is permitted by the terms of this Agreement and applicable law, require







 that such Borrower pay to it (i) as additional servicing compensation, a reasonable and customary fee for the additional services performed in connection with such request (provided that the charging of such fee would not constitute a "significant modification" of the related Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.860G-2(b)), and (ii) any related costs and expenses incurred by it.  In no event shall the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer be entitled to payment for such fees or expenses unless such payment is collected from the related Borrower.



 (h)           Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Master Servicer shall not permit the substitution of any Mortgaged Property pursuant to the defeasance provisions of any Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination (or any portion thereof), if any, unless such defeasance complies with Treasury Regulations Section 1.860G-2(a)(8) and satisfies the conditions set forth in Section 3.09(g) of this Agreement.



 (i)           Notwithstanding anything herein or in the related Loan Documents to the contrary (but subject to Special Servicer's right to process any request with respect to a Special Servicer Decision or to consent to the Master Servicer processing such request pursuant to Section 3.26(m)), the Master Servicer may permit the substitution of direct, non-callable "government securities" within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, or any other securities that comply with Treasury Regulations Section 1.860G-2(a)(8)(ii) (including UxxPDSxxPD government agency securities if such securities are eligible defeasance collateral under then current guidelines of the Rating Agencies) for any Mortgaged Property pursuant to the defeasance provisions of any Mortgage Loan (other than a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan) or Serviced Loan Combination (or any portion thereof) in lieu of the defeasance collateral specified in the related Loan Documents; provided that, the Master Servicer reasonably determines that allowing their use would not cause a default or event of default under the related Loan Documents to become reasonably foreseeable and the Master Servicer receives an Opinion of Counsel (at the expense of the Borrower to the extent permitted under the Loan Documents) to the effect that such use would not be and would not constitute a "significant modification" of such Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section 1.860G-2(b) and would not otherwise endanger the status of the Lower-Tier REMIC or the Upper-Tier REMIC as a REMIC or result in the imposition of a tax upon the Lower-Tier REMIC, the Upper-Tier REMIC or the Trust Fund (including but not limited to the tax on "prohibited transactions" as defined in Section 860F(a)(2) of the Code and the tax on contributions to a REMIC set forth in Section 860G(d) of the Code, but not including the tax on "net income from foreclosure property") and provided, that the requirements set forth in Section 3.09(g) of this Agreement are satisfied.



 (j)           If required under the related Loan Documents or if otherwise consistent with the Servicing Standard, the Master Servicer shall establish and maintain one or more accounts, which may be sub-accounts of the Collection Account (the "Defeasance Accounts"), into which all payments received by the Master Servicer from any defeasance collateral substituted for any Mortgaged Property shall be deposited and retained, and shall administer such Defeasance Accounts in accordance with the Loan Documents.  Each Defeasance Account shall at all times be an Eligible Account.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the Master Servicer permit such amounts to be maintained in the Defeasance Account for a period in excess of 12 months, unless such amounts are reinvested by the Master Servicer in "government







 securities" within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, or any other securities that comply with Treasury Regulations Section 1.860G-2(a)(8)(ii).  To the extent not required or permitted to be placed in a separate account, the Master Servicer shall deposit all payments received by it from defeasance collateral substituted for any Mortgaged Property into the Collection Account or, if a Serviced Loan Combination is involved, the Serviced Loan Combination Collection Account and treat any such payments as payments made on the Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination, as applicable, in advance of its Due Date in accordance with clause (a) of the definition of Principal Distribution Amount, and not as a prepayment of the related Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination.  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in no event shall the Master Servicer permit such amounts to be maintained in the Collection Account or, if a Serviced Loan Combination is involved, the Serviced Loan Combination Collection Account for a period in excess of 365 days.



 (k)           Any right to take any action, grant or withhold any consent or otherwise exercise any right, election or remedy afforded the Directing Holder under this Agreement may, unless otherwise expressly provided herein to the contrary, be affirmatively waived by the Directing Holder by written notice given to the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator, the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as applicable.  Upon delivery of any such notice of waiver given by the Directing Holder, any time period (exclusive or otherwise) afforded the Directing Holder to exercise any such right, make any such election or grant or withhold any such consent shall thereupon be deemed to have expired with the same force and effect as if the specific time period set forth in this Agreement applicable thereto had itself expired.  If the Master Servicer or Special Servicer determines that a refusal to consent by the Directing Holder or any advice from the Directing Holder would cause the Master Servicer or Special Servicer, as applicable, to violate applicable law, the terms of the applicable Loan Documents, any related Intercreditor Agreements, the REMIC Provisions or the terms of this Agreement, including without limitation, the Servicing Standard, the Master Servicer or Special Servicer shall disregard such refusal to consent or advice and notify the Directing Holder, the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator, the related Serviced Companion Loan Noteholder (if any) and the 17g-5 Information Provider (who shall promptly post such notice to the 17g-5 Information Provider's Website pursuant to Section 3.14(d) of this Agreement) of its determination, including a reasonably detailed explanation of the basis therefor.



 (l)           Any modification, waiver or amendment of or consents or approvals relating to a Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination that is a Specially Serviced Loan or Serviced REO Loan (i) shall be performed by the Special Servicer and not the Master Servicer, (ii) to the extent provided in this Agreement and/or the applicable Intercreditor Agreement, shall be subject to the consent of the related Directing Holder, and (iii) shall be structured so as to be consistent with the allocation and payment priorities in the related Loan Documents and Intercreditor Agreement, if any, such that neither the Trust as holder of the Mortgage Loan nor a holder of any related Serviced Companion Loan gains a priority over the other such holder that is not reflected in the related Loan Documents and Intercreditor Agreement.



 (m)           In addition, with respect to a Performing Loan (other than a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan), the Master Servicer, prior to taking action with respect to any Major Decision (or making a determination not to take action with respect to a Major Decision) or any Special Servicer Decision, shall refer the request to the Special Servicer, which shall process the request







 directly or, if mutually agreed to by the Special Servicer and the Master Servicer, the Master Servicer shall (subject to the consent of the Special Servicer) process such request.  If the Master Servicer processes such request, the Master Servicer shall prepare and submit its written recommendation and analysis to the Special Servicer with all information reasonably available to the Master Servicer that the Special Servicer may reasonably request in order to withhold or grant its consent, and in all cases the Special Servicer shall be entitled (subject to the consultation rights of the Operating Advisor or the consent or consultation rights of the Directing Holder) to approve or disapprove any modification, waiver or amendment that constitutes a Major Decision or Special Servicer Decision.  When the Special Servicer's processing and/or consent is required hereunder, such consent shall be deemed given 15 Business Days, or such longer time period pursuant to the terms of the related Intercreditor Agreement but not less than five (5) Business Days after the time period set forth therein for Directing Holder approval, (or in connection with an Acceptable Insurance Default, 90 days) after receipt (unless earlier objected to) by the Special Servicer from the Master Servicer of the Master Servicer's written analysis and recommendation with respect to such proposed action together with such other information reasonably required by the Special Servicer.  With respect to all Specially Serviced Loans and Performing Loans (other than Non-Serviced Mortgage Loans), the Special Servicer shall, prior to consenting to such a proposed action of the Master Servicer, and prior to itself taking such an action, obtain the written consent of the related Directing Holder, which consent shall be deemed given 10 Business Days after receipt (or in connection with an Acceptable Insurance Default, 30 days) (unless earlier objected to) by such Directing Holder of the Master Servicer's and/or Special Servicer's, as applicable, written analysis and recommendation with respect to such action together with such other information reasonably required by such Directing Holder.



 (n)          For any Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination (other than a Specially-Serviced Loan or a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan), subject to the rights of the Special Servicer set forth in this Section 3.26, and further subject to the rights of the Directing Holder and the Operating Advisor set forth herein, and, with respect to any Serviced Loan Combination, further subject to the rights of the related Companion Loan Noteholders under the related Intercreditor Agreement, the Master Servicer, without the consent of the Special Servicer, the Directing Holder or the Operating Advisor, as applicable, shall be responsible to determine whether to consent to or approve any request by a Borrower with respect to:



 (i)           approving routine leasing activity with respect to any lease for less than the lesser of (A) 30,000 square feet and (B) 30% of the net rentable area of the related Mortgaged Property;



 (ii)          approving any waiver affecting the timing of receipt of financial statements from any Borrower; provided that such financial statements are delivered no less than quarterly and within 60 days after the end of the calendar quarter;



 (iii)         approving annual budgets for the related Mortgaged Property; provided that no such budget (A) provides for the payment of operating expenses in an amount equal to more than 110% of the amounts budgeted therefor for the prior year or (B) provides for the payment of any material expenses to any affiliate of the Borrower (other than the payment of a management fee to any property manager if such management fee is no more than the management fee in effect on the Cut-off Date);







 (iv)         subject to other restrictions herein regarding Principal Prepayments, waiving any provision of a Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination requiring a specified number of days' notice prior to a Principal Prepayment;



 (v)          approving modifications, consents or waivers (other than modifications, consents or waivers specifically prohibited under this Section 3.26) in connection with a defeasance provided that such proposed modification, waiver, consent or amendment does not relate to a (i) a waiver of a mortgage loan event of default, (ii) a modification of the type of defeasance collateral required under the Mortgage Loan documents other than direct, non-callable obligations of the United States would be permitted or (iii) a modification that would permit a principal prepayment instead of defeasance if the applicable loan documents do not otherwise permit such principal prepayment.  Additionally, such proposed modification, waiver, consent or amendment is subject to the requirements set forth in Section 3.09(g) of this Agreement;



 (vi)         approving consents with respect to non-material rights-of-way and non-material easements and consent to subordination of the related Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination to such non-material rights-of-way or easements; provided, that the Master Servicer shall have determined in accordance with the Servicing Standard that such right-of-way or easement shall not materially interfere with the then-current use of the related Mortgaged Property or the security intended to be provided by the related Mortgage and will not have a material adverse effect on the value of such Mortgaged Property;



 (vii)        granting waivers of minor covenant defaults (other than financial covenants);



 (viii)       as permitted under the Loan Documents, payment from any escrow or reserve, except (1) releases of any escrows, reserves or letters of credit held as performance escrows or reserves (unless required pursuant to the specific terms of the related Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination and for which there is no material lender discretion) or (2) releases of earnouts or holdback amounts with respect to those Mortgage Loans identified on Exhibit U hereto;



 (ix)          approving a change of the property manager at the request of the related Borrower so long as (a) the successor property manager is not affiliated with the borrower and is a nationally or regionally recognized manager of similar properties, and (b) the subject Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination does not have an outstanding principal balance in excess of the lesser of $5,000,000 or 2% of the then aggregate principal balance of the Mortgage Loans;



 (x)           subject to the satisfaction of any conditions precedent set forth in the related Loan Documents, approving disbursements of any earnout or holdback amounts in accordance with the related Loan Documents with respect to certain Mortgage Loans other than those Mortgage Loans identified on Exhibit U hereto; and



 (xi)          any non-material modifications, waivers or amendments not provided for in clauses (i) through (x) above, which are necessary to cure any ambiguities or to correct







 scrivener's errors in the terms of the related Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination;



 provided, in the case of any Serviced Loan Combination, the Master Servicer shall provide written notice of such action to the related Companion Loan Noteholders.  For the avoidance of doubt, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, any request for the disbursement of earnouts or holdback amounts with respect to (i) any Specially Serviced Loan shall be processed by the Special Servicer and (ii) any Mortgage Loan listed on Exhibit U received by the Master Servicer shall be processed by the Master Servicer and submitted to the Special Servicer for approval.  For purposes of this Agreement, "disbursement of earnouts or holdback amounts" shall mean the disbursement or funding to a borrower of previously unfunded, escrowed or otherwise reserved portions of the loan proceeds of the applicable Mortgage Loan until certain conditions precedent thereto relating to the satisfaction of performance-related criteria (ixxPDexxPD, project reserve thresholds, lease-up requirements, sales requirements, etc), as set forth in the applicable loan documents, have been satisfied.



 Section 3.27      Certain Intercreditor Matters Relating to the Serviced Loan Combinations.  (a)  With respect to Serviced Loan Combinations, except for those duties to be performed by, and notices to be furnished by, the Trustee under this Agreement, the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as applicable, shall perform such duties and furnish such notices, reports and information on behalf of the Trust Fund as may be the obligation of the Trust, or the obligation of the master servicer or the special servicer, as applicable, following securitization, under the related Intercreditor Agreement.



 (b)           The Master Servicer shall maintain a register (the "Serviced Companion Loan Noteholder Register") on which the Master Servicer shall record the names and addresses of the Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders and wire transfer instructions for such Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders from time to time, to the extent such information is provided in writing to the Master Servicer by a Serviced Companion Loan Noteholder.  Each Serviced Companion Loan Noteholder has agreed to inform the Master Servicer of its name, address, taxpayer identification number and wiring instructions (to the extent the foregoing information is not already contained in the related Intercreditor Agreement) and of any transfer thereof (together with any instruments of transfer).  The name and address of each initial Serviced Companion Loan Noteholder as of the Closing Date is set forth on Schedule VII hereto.  The Master Servicer shall be entitled to conclusively rely upon the information delivered by any Serviced Companion Loan Noteholder until it receives notice of transfer or of any change in information.



 In no event shall the Master Servicer be obligated to pay any party the amounts payable to a Serviced Companion Loan Noteholder hereunder other than the Person listed as the applicable Serviced Companion Loan Noteholder on the Serviced Companion Loan Noteholder Register.  In the event that a Serviced Companion Loan Noteholder transfers the related Serviced Companion Loan without notice to the Master Servicer, the Master Servicer shall have no liability whatsoever for any misdirected payment on such Serviced Companion Loan and shall have no obligation to recover and redirect such payment.



 The Master Servicer shall promptly provide the names and addresses of any Serviced Companion Loan Noteholder to any party hereto, any related Companion Loan







 Noteholder or any successor thereto upon written request, and any such party or successor may, without further investigation, conclusively rely upon such information.  The Master Servicer shall have no liability to any Person for the provision of any such names and addresses.



 (c)           The Directing Holder shall not owe any fiduciary duty to the Trustee, any Master Servicer, any Special Servicer, any Certificateholder (including the Controlling Class Representative, if applicable) or any noteholder of a Serviced Loan Combination, as applicable.  The Directing Holder will not have any liability to the Certificateholders (including the Controlling Class Representative, if applicable) or any other noteholder of a Serviced Loan Combination, as applicable, for any action taken, or for refraining from the taking of any action or the giving of any consent, pursuant to this Agreement, or for errors in judgment.



 (d)           With respect to any Serviced Loan Combination, the Directing Holder shall be entitled to exercise the consent rights, cure rights and purchase rights, as applicable, to the extent set forth in the applicable Intercreditor Agreement, in accordance with the terms of the related Intercreditor Agreement and this Agreement.



 (e)           The Special Servicer (if any Serviced Companion Loan is a Specially Serviced Loan or has become a Serviced REO Loan) or the Master Servicer (otherwise), as applicable, shall take all actions relating to the servicing and/or administration of, and (subject to Section 3.13 and Section 3.17 of this Agreement and the following paragraph) the preparation and delivery of reports and other information with respect to, the Serviced Loan Combination related to any Serviced Companion Loan or any related Serviced REO Property required to be performed by the holder of the related Mortgage Loan or contemplated to be performed by a servicer, in any case pursuant to and as required by each related Intercreditor Agreement and/or any related mezzanine intercreditor agreement existing on the Closing Date and any related Intercreditor Agreement or mezzanine intercreditor agreement not existing on the Closing Date that is provided to the Master Servicer or Special Servicer, as applicable.  In addition notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the following considerations shall apply with respect to the servicing of a Serviced Companion Loan:



 (i)             none of the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer or the Trustee shall make any P&I Advance with respect to the Serviced Companion Loan; and



 (ii)           the Master Servicer and the Special Servicer shall each consult with and obtain the consent of the related Serviced Companion Loan Noteholder(s) to the extent required by the related Intercreditor Agreement.



 The Master Servicer or Special Servicer, as applicable, shall timely provide to each related Serviced Companion Loan Noteholder any reports or notices required to be delivered to such Serviced Companion Loan Noteholder pursuant to the related Intercreditor Agreement, and the Special Servicer shall reasonably cooperate with the Master Servicer and the Master Servicer shall reasonably cooperate with the Special Servicer in preparing/delivering any such report or notice with respect to special servicing matters.



 If any Serviced Companion Loan or any portion thereof or any particular payments thereon are included in a REMIC or a "grantor trust" (within the meaning of the Grantor Trust Provisions), then neither the Master Servicer nor the Special Servicer shall







 knowingly take any action that would result in the equivalent of an Adverse REMIC Event with respect to such REMIC or adversely affect the tax status of such grantor trust as a grantor trust.



 The parties hereto acknowledge that a Serviced Companion Loan Noteholder shall not (1) owe any fiduciary duty to the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator, the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer or any Certificateholder or (2) have any liability to the Trustee or the Certificateholders for any action taken, or for refraining from the taking of any action pursuant to the related Intercreditor Agreement or the giving of any consent or for errors in judgment.  Each Certificateholder, by its acceptance of a Certificate, shall be deemed to have confirmed its understanding that a Serviced Companion Loan Noteholder (i) may take or refrain from taking actions that favor its interests or the interests of its affiliates over the Certificateholders, (ii) may have special relationships and interests that conflict with the interests of the Certificateholders and shall be deemed to have agreed to take no action against a Serviced Companion Loan Noteholder or any of its officers, directors, employees, principals or agents as a result of such special relationships or conflicts, and (iii) shall not be liable by reason of its having acted or refrained from acting solely in its interest or in the interest of its affiliates.



 The parties hereto recognize and acknowledge the respective rights of each Serviced Companion Loan Noteholder under the related Intercreditor Agreement.  Each of the rights of a Serviced Companion Loan Noteholder under or contemplated by this Section 3.27(e) may be exercisable by a designee thereof on its behalf; provided that the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Certificate Administrator and the Trustee are provided with written notice by the related Serviced Companion Loan Noteholder of such designation (upon which such party may conclusively rely) and the contact details of the designee.



 Notwithstanding anything herein or in the Intercreditor Agreement to the contrary, no direction or objection by the Serviced Companion Loan Noteholder may require or cause the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as applicable, to violate any provision of any Mortgage Loan, applicable law, this Agreement, any Intercreditor Agreement or the REMIC Provisions, including without limitation the Master Servicer's or Special Servicer's obligation to act in accordance with the Servicing Standard, or expose the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Paying Agent, the Trust Fund, the Certificate Administrator or the Trustee to liability, or materially expand the scope of the Master Servicer's or Special Servicer's responsibilities hereunder.



 Any reference to servicing any of the Mortgage Loans in accordance with any of the related Loan Documents (including the related Note and Mortgage) shall also mean, in the case of a Serviced Loan Combination, in accordance with the related Intercreditor Agreement.



 To the extent not otherwise expressly included herein, any provisions required to be included herein pursuant to any Intercreditor Agreement for a Serviced Loan Combination are deemed incorporated herein by reference, and the parties hereto shall comply with those provisions as if set forth herein in full.



 For purposes of exercising any rights that the holder of the Note for any Mortgage Loan in a Serviced Loan Combination may have under the related Intercreditor Agreement, the Directing Holder shall be the designee of the Trust, as such noteholder, and the Trustee shall take







 such actions as may be necessary under the related Intercreditor Agreement to effect such designation.



 (f)           With respect to a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan, the Master Servicer shall deliver information comparable to the above-described information in Section 3.13(c) and Section 3.13(d) hereof to the same Persons as described above in Section 3.13(c) and Section 3.13(d) and according to the same time frames as described above in Section 3.13(c) and Section 3.13(d), with reasonable promptness following such Master Servicer's receipt of such information from the Other Servicer under the Other Pooling and Servicing Agreement.



 Promptly following the Closing Date, the Certificate Administrator shall send written notice substantially in the form of Exhibit DD hereto, accompanied by a copy of an executed version of this Agreement, with respect to each Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan to each applicable Other Servicer, Other Special Servicer and Other Trustee stating that, as of the Closing Date, the Trustee is the holder of the applicable Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan and directing each such recipient to remit to the Master Servicer no later than one (1) Business Day after each Determination Date all amounts payable to, and to forward, deliver or otherwise make available, as the case may be, to the Master Servicer no later than one (1) Business Day after each Determination Date all reports, statements, documents, communications and other information that are to be forwarded, delivered or otherwise made available to, the holder of the applicable Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan under the related Intercreditor Agreement and Other Pooling and Servicing Agreement.  Such notice shall also provide contact information for the Certificate Administrator, the Trustee, the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Directing Holder and the Rating Agencies.



 With respect to a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan, if the applicable Other Servicer, Other Special Servicer or Other Trustee shall be replaced in accordance with the terms of the related Other Pooling and Servicing Agreement, promptly upon notice thereof, the applicable party to this Agreement that receives such notice shall, upon request, acknowledge such successor as the successor to the Other Servicer, Other Special Servicer or Other Trustee, as the case may be.



 With respect to each Serviced Loan Combination, the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as applicable, shall provide each Companion Loan Noteholder and, if applicable, related Non-Directing Holder (or its designee or representative), within the same time frame and to the same extent it is required to provide such information and materials to the Certificateholders or the Directing Holder, as applicable, hereunder with (1) copies of each financial statement received by the Master Servicer pursuant to the terms of the related Loan Documents, (2) copies of any notice of default sent to the Borrower and (3) subject to the terms of the Loan Documents, copies of any other documents or information relating to the Serviced Loan Combination (including, without limitation, property inspection reports, loan servicing statements, Borrower requests and asset status reports) that the Master Servicer delivers to the related Directing Holder and copies of any other notice, information or report that it is required to provide to the Directing Holder pursuant to this Agreement with respect to any Major Decision or with respect to any "major decisions" or "major actions" as set forth in the related Intercreditor Agreement or the implementation of any recommended actions outlined in an Asset Status Report relating to such Serviced Loan Combination.  Any copies to be furnished by the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer may be furnished by hard copy or electronic means.







 Section 3.28       Directing Holder Contact with the Master Servicer and the Special Servicer.  Each of the Master Servicer and the Special Servicer shall, not more frequently than once per month, without charge, make a knowledgeable Servicing Officer via telephone available during normal business hours to verbally answer questions from the Directing Holder (for so long as no Consultation Termination Event has occurred and is continuing) and the Operating Advisor (for so long as a Control Termination Event has occurred and is continuing) regarding the performance and servicing of the Mortgage Loans and/or REO Properties for which the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as the case may be, is responsible.



 Section 3.29       Controlling Class Certificateholders and the Controlling Class Representative; Certain Rights and Powers of the Directing Holder.  (a)  Each Certificateholder and Beneficial Owner of a Control Eligible Certificate is hereby deemed to have agreed by virtue of its purchase of such Certificate (or beneficial ownership interest in such Certificate) to provide its name and address to the Certificate Registrar and to notify the Certificate Registrar of the transfer of any Control Eligible Certificate (or the beneficial ownership of any Control Eligible Certificate), the selection of a Controlling Class Representative or the resignation or removal thereof.  Any such Certificateholder (or Beneficial Owner) or its designee at any time appointed Controlling Class Representative is hereby deemed to have agreed by virtue of its purchase of a Control Eligible Certificate (or the beneficial ownership interest in a Control Eligible Certificate) to notify the Certificate Registrar when such Certificateholder (or Beneficial Owner) or designee is appointed Controlling Class Representative and when it is removed or resigns.  Upon receipt of such notice, the Certificate Registrar shall notify the Special Servicer, the Master Servicer, the Certificate Administrator, the Depositor, the Operating Advisor, the Trustee and each Serviced Companion Loan Noteholder of the identity of the Controlling Class Representative, any resignation or removal thereof and/or any new Holder or Beneficial Owner of a Control Eligible Certificate.



 In addition, upon the request of the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Certificate Administrator, the Trustee or the Operating Advisor, as applicable, the Certificate Registrar shall promptly (but no later than five (5) Business Days after such request) provide to the requesting party the identity of the then-current Controlling Class and a list of the Holders of Certificates of the Controlling Class.  However, if any Controlling Class Certificateholder is listed as being the Depository, then the Certificate Administrator shall promptly (but in no event more than five (5) Business Days following such request) request from the Depository, the list of Beneficial Owners of the Controlling Class, and the Certificate Administrator shall provide such list to the requesting party promptly upon receipt; provided that, if any Controlling Class Certificateholder is listed as the Depository and the Certificate Administrator has actual knowledge of the identity of the related Beneficial Owner, then the Certificate Administrator shall include such Beneficial Owner in the list provided to any requesting party pursuant to first sentence of this paragraph.  The Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Trustee and the Operating Advisor shall be entitled to conclusively rely on any such information so provided. Any expenses incurred in connection with obtaining such information shall be at the expense of the requesting party, except that if (i) such expenses arise in connection with an event as to which the Directing Holder (or Controlling Class Representative) has review, consent or consultation rights with respect to an action taken by, or report prepared by, the requesting party pursuant to this Agreement and (ii) the requesting party has not been notified of the identity of the Directing Holder (or Controlling Class Representative) or reasonably believes that the







 identity of the Directing Holder (or Controlling Class Representative) has changed, then such expenses shall be at the expense of the Trust.



 To the extent the Master Servicer has actual knowledge of any change in the identity of a Holder (or Beneficial Owners) of the Controlling Class, then the Master Servicer shall promptly notify the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator, the Operating Advisor and the Special Servicer thereof, who may rely conclusively on such notice from the Master Servicer.



 (b)           Once a Controlling Class Representative has been selected, each of the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Depositor, the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator, the Certificate Registrar, the Operating Advisor, the Paying Agent and each other Certificateholder (or Beneficial Owner, if applicable) shall be entitled to rely on such selection unless a majority of the Controlling Class Certificateholders, by Certificate Balance, or such Controlling Class Representative shall have notified the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator, the Operating Advisor, the Paying Agent and each other Controlling Class Certificateholder, in writing, of the resignation of such Controlling Class Representative or the selection of a new Controlling Class Representative.  Upon the resignation of a Controlling Class Representative, the Certificate Administrator shall request the Controlling Class Certificateholders to select a new Controlling Class Representative.



 (c)           Until it receives notice to the contrary, each of the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Paying Agent, the Certificate Administrator, the Operating Advisor and the Trustee shall be entitled to rely on the most recent notification with respect to the identity of the Controlling Class Certificateholder and the Controlling Class Representative.



 (d)           The Master Servicer, Special Servicer, Trustee or Operating Advisor shall be entitled to request that the Certificate Administrator provide, and the Certificate Administrator shall promptly (but no later than five (5) Business Days after such request) provide (i) for so long as no Consultation Termination Event has occurred and is continuing, the identity of the Controlling Class Representative, including names and addresses and (ii) confirmation as to whether a Control Termination Event or Consultation Termination Event has occurred in the 12 months preceding any such request or any other period specified in such request.  In addition to the foregoing, within two (2) Business Days of receiving notice of the selection of a new Controlling Class Representative or the existence of a new Controlling Class Certificateholder, the Certificate Administrator shall notify the Trustee, the Operating Advisor, the Master Servicer and the Special Servicer.



 At any time more than 50% of the Percentage Interest of the Controlling Class Certificateholders direct the Certificate Administrator in writing to hold an election for a Controlling Class Representative, the Certificate Administrator shall hold such election as soon as practicable at the expense of such requesting Certificateholders.



 (e)           If to the extent the Certificate Administrator determines that a Class of Book-Entry Certificates is the Controlling Class, the Certificate Administrator shall notify the related Certificateholders of such Class (through the Depository) of such event.



 (f)           Each Certificateholder acknowledges and agrees, by its acceptance of its Certificates, that:  (i) the Directing Holder may have special relationships and interests that







 conflict with those of Holders of one or more Classes of Certificates or Companion Loan Noteholders; (ii) the Directing Holder may act solely in the interests of the Holders of the Controlling Class or, in the case of a Loan Combination, in the interests of one or more Companion Loan Noteholders); (iii) the Directing Holder does not have any liability or duties to the Holders of any Class of Certificates other than the Controlling Class; (iv) the Directing Holder may take actions that favor the interests of the Directing Holder or one or more Classes of the Certificates including the Holders of the Controlling Class (or, in the case of a Loan Combination, one or more Companion Loan Noteholders) over the interests of the Holders of one or more Classes of Certificates and other Companion Loan Noteholders; and (v) the Directing Holder shall have no liability whatsoever to any Certificateholder, the Trust, any Companion Loan Noteholder any party hereto or any other Person (including any Borrower under a Mortgage Loan) for having so acted as set forth in clauses (i) through (iv) of this paragraph, and no Certificateholder or Companion Loan Noteholder may take any action whatsoever against the Directing Holder or any director, officer, employee, agent or principal thereof for having so acted.



 (g)           The Certificate Registrar shall determine which Class of Certificates is the then-current Controlling Class within two (2) Business Days of a request from the Master Servicer, Special Servicer, Trustee, the Operating Advisor, the Certificate Administrator or any Certificateholder and provide such information to the requesting party.



 (h)           At any time when the most senior Class of Control Eligible Certificates are the Controlling Class, the Holder of more than 50% of the Controlling Class (by Certificate Principal Amount) may waive its right to act as, or appoint a representative to act as, the Controlling Class Representative and to exercise any of the rights of the Controlling Class Representative or cause the exercise of any of the rights of the Controlling Class Representative by irrevocable written notice delivered to the Depositor, Certificate Administrator, Certificate Registrar, Trustee, Master Servicer, Special Servicer and Operating Advisor. Any such waiver shall remain effective with respect to such Holder and the most senior Class of Control Eligible Certificates until such time as that Certificateholder has (i) sold a majority of the most senior Class of Control Eligible Certificates (by Certificate Principal Amount) to an unaffiliated third party and (ii) certified to the Depositor, Certificate Administrator, Certificate Registrar, Trustee, Master Servicer, Special Servicer and Operating Advisor that (a) the transferor retains no direct or indirect voting rights with respect to the most senior Class of Control Eligible Certificates that it does not own, (b) there is no voting agreement between the transferee and the transferor and (c) the transferor retains no direct or indirect controlling interest in the most senior Class of Control Eligible Certificates.  During such waiver period a Consultation Termination Event shall be deemed to exist and the rights of the Controlling Class to appoint a Controlling Class Representative and the rights of the Controlling Class Representative shall not be operative (notwithstanding whether a Control Termination Event or a Consultation Termination Event is or would otherwise then be in effect).  Following any transfer of more than 50% of the most senior Class of Control Eligible Certificates, the successor Holder of more than 50% of the most senior Class of Control Eligible Certificates, if the most senior Class of Control Eligible Certificates are the Controlling Class (by Certificate Principal Amount) shall again have the right to act as, or appoint a representative to act as, the Controlling Class Representative without regard to any prior waiver by the predecessor Certificateholder. The successor Certificateholder shall also have the right to irrevocably waive its right to act as or appoint a Controlling Class Representative or







 to exercise any of the rights of the Controlling Class Representative or cause the exercise of any of the rights of the Controlling Class Representative. No successor Certificateholder described above shall have any consent rights with respect to any Mortgage Loan that became a Specially Serviced Loan prior to its acquisition of a majority of the most senior Class of Control Eligible Certificates that had not also become a corrected loan prior to such acquisition until such Mortgage Loan becomes a Corrected Loan.



 Section 3.30       No Downgrade Confirmation.  (a)  Notwithstanding the terms of any related Loan Documents or other provisions of this Agreement, if any action under any Loan Documents or this Agreement requires a No Downgrade Confirmation as a condition precedent to such action, if the party (the "Requesting Party") attempting to obtain such No Downgrade Confirmation from each Rating Agency has made a request to any Rating Agency for such No Downgrade Confirmation and, within 10 Business Days of the No Downgrade Confirmation request being posted to the 17g-5 Information Provider's Website, such Rating Agency has not replied to such request or has responded in a manner that indicates that such Rating Agency is neither reviewing such request nor waiving the requirement for No Downgrade Confirmation, then (i) such Requesting Party shall (without providing notice to the 17g-5 Information Provider) confirm that the applicable Rating Agency has received the No Downgrade Confirmation request, and, if it has not, promptly request the related No Downgrade Confirmation again and (ii) if there is no response to either such No Downgrade Confirmation request within 5 Business Days of such second request or such Rating Agency has responded in a manner that indicates it is neither reviewing such request nor waiving the requirement for No Downgrade Confirmation, (x) with respect to any such condition in any Loan Document requiring such No Downgrade Confirmation or any other matter under this Agreement relating to the servicing of the Mortgage Loans (other than as set forth in clause (y) below), the Requesting Party (or, if the Requesting Party is the related Borrower, then the Master Servicer (with respect to non-Specially Serviced Loans) or the Special Servicer (with respect to Specially Serviced Loans and Serviced REO Loans), as applicable) shall determine, in accordance with its duties under this Agreement and in accordance with the Servicing Standard, whether or not such action would be in the best interests of the Certificateholders and, in the case of a Serviced Loan Combination, Certificateholders and any holder of the related Serviced Companion Loan (as a collective whole as if such Certificateholders and Serviced Companion Loan holders constituted a single lender), and if the Requesting Party (or, if the Requesting Party is the related Borrower, then the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as applicable) determines that such action would be in the best interest of such parties, then the requirement for a No Downgrade Confirmation will be deemed not to apply, and (y) with respect to a replacement of the Master Servicer or Special Servicer, such condition shall be deemed to be satisfied if the applicable replacement (i) is rated at least "CMS3" (in the case of the Master Servicer) or "CSS3" (in the case of the Special Servicer), if Fitch is the non-responding Rating Agency, (ii) KBRA has not cited servicing concerns of the applicable replacement as the sole or material factor in any qualification, downgrade or withdrawal of the ratings (or placement on "watch status" in contemplation of a ratings downgrade or withdrawal) of securities in a transaction serviced by the applicable servicer prior to the time of determination, if KBRA is the non-responding Rating Agency and (iii) Moody's has not cited servicing concerns of the applicable replacement as the sole or material factor in any qualification, downgrade or withdrawal of the ratings (or placement on "watch status" in contemplation of a ratings downgrade or withdrawal) of securities in any other CMBS







 transaction serviced by the applicable servicer prior to the time of determination, if Moody's is the non-responding Rating Agency.



 Any No Downgrade Confirmation request made by the Master Servicer, Special Servicer, Certificate Administrator or Trustee, as applicable, pursuant to this Agreement, shall be made in writing, which writing shall contain a cover page indicating the nature of the No Downgrade Confirmation request, and shall contain all back-up material necessary for the Rating Agency to process such request.  Such written No Downgrade Confirmation request shall be provided in electronic format to the 17g-5 Information Provider, and the 17g-5 Information Provider shall post such request on the 17g-5 Information Provider's Website in accordance with Section 3.14(d) of this Agreement.



 Promptly following the Master Servicer's or Special Servicer's determination to take any action discussed in this Section 3.30(a) following any requirement to obtain a No Downgrade Confirmation being considered satisfied, the Master Servicer or Special Servicer, as the case may be, shall provide electronic written notice to the 17g-5 Information Provider of the action taken for the particular item at such time, and the 17g-5 Information Provider shall post such notice on the 17g-5 Information Provider's Website in accordance with Section 3.14(d) of this Agreement.



 (b)           Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 3.30, for purposes of the provisions of any Loan Document relating to defeasance (including without limitation the type of collateral acceptable for use as defeasance collateral), release or substitution of any collateral, any No Downgrade Confirmation requirement in the Loan Documents with respect to which the Master Servicer or Special Servicer would have been required to make the determination described in Section 3.30(a) shall be deemed not to apply regardless of any such determination by the Requesting Party (or, if the Requesting Party is the related Borrower, the Master Servicer (with respect to non-Specially Serviced Loans) or the Special Servicer (with respect to Specially Serviced Loans and Serviced REO Loans), as applicable); provided, that the Requesting Party (or the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as applicable) shall in any event review the other conditions required under the related Loan Documents with respect to such defeasance, release or substitution and confirm to its satisfaction in accordance with the Servicing Standard that such conditions (other than the requirement for a No Downgrade Confirmation) have been satisfied.



 (c)           For all other matters or actions not specifically discussed in Section 3.30(a) above, the applicable Requesting Party shall deliver a No Downgrade Confirmation from each Rating Agency.



 (d)           Notwithstanding the terms of the related Loan Documents, the other provisions of this Agreement or the applicable Intercreditor Agreement, with respect to any Serviced Companion Loan as to which there exists Serviced Companion Loan Securities, if any action relating to the servicing and administration of the related Loan Combination or any related REO Property (the "Relevant Action") requires delivery of a No Downgrade Confirmation as a condition precedent to such action pursuant to this Agreement, then, except as set forth below in this paragraph, such action shall also require delivery of a Serviced Companion Loan No Downgrade Confirmation as a condition precedent to such action from each related Serviced Companion Loan Rating Agency.  Each Serviced Companion Loan No Downgrade Confirmation







 shall be sought by the Master Servicer or Special Servicer, as applicable, depending on whichever such party is seeking the corresponding No Downgrade Confirmation(s) in connection with the Relevant Action.  The requirement to obtain a Serviced Companion Loan No Downgrade Confirmation with respect to any Serviced Companion Loan Securities will be subject to, will be permitted to be waived by the Master Servicer and the Special Servicer on, and will be deemed not to apply on, the same terms and conditions applicable to obtaining No Downgrade Confirmations, as set forth in this Agreement; provided that the  Master Servicer or Special Servicer, as applicable, depending on which is seeking the subject Serviced Companion Loan No Downgrade Confirmation, shall forward to one or more of its counterpart (ixxPDexxPD, the Other Servicer or Other Special Servicer, as applicable), the Other 17g-5 Information Provider, or such other party or parties as are agreed to by the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as applicable, and the applicable parties for the related Other Securitization, at the expense of the Other Securitization to the extent not borne by the related Borrower, and in such format as the sender and recipient may reasonably agree, (i) the request for such Serviced Companion Loan No Downgrade Confirmation, (ii) all materials forwarded to the 17g-5 Information Provider under this Agreement in connection with seeking the No Downgrade Confirmation(s) for the applicable Relevant Action at approximately the same time that such materials are forwarded to the 17g-5 Information Provider, and (iii) any other materials that the applicable Serviced Companion Loan Rating Agency may reasonably request in connection with such Serviced Companion Loan No Downgrade Confirmation promptly following receipt of such request from the Other Certificate Administrator.



 The Certificate Administrator shall, promptly following receipt of written request from the Special Servicer, provide to the Special Servicer the contact information for the Other Servicer, the Other Special Servicer, the Other Certificate Administrator, the Other Trustee and the Other 17g-5 Information Provider for the Other Securitization, solely to the extent known to it.



 Section 3.31        Appointment and Duties of the Operating Advisor.



 (a)           Park Bridge Lender Services LLC is hereby appointed to serve as the initial Operating Advisor.



 (b)           The Operating Advisor, as an independent contractor, shall review the Special Servicer's operational practices in respect of Specially Serviced Loans, consult, in certain circumstances with the Special Servicer and perform each other obligation of the Operating Advisor as set forth in this Agreement solely on behalf of the Trust Fund and in the best interest of, and for the benefit of, the Certificateholders and, with respect to each Serviced Loan Combination, for the benefit of the related Companion Loan Noteholder (as a collective whole as if such Certificateholders and Companion Loan Noteholder constituted a single lender), and not any particular Class of Certificateholders (as determined by the Operating Advisor in the exercise of its good faith and reasonable judgment) (the "Operating Advisor Standard").  The Operating Advisor shall not owe any fiduciary duty to the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer or any other Person in connection with this Agreement.  By purchasing a Certificate, Certificateholders are deemed to acknowledge and agree that there could be multiple strategies to resolve any Specially Serviced Loan and that the goal of the Operating Advisor's participation is to provide additional oversight relating to the Special Servicer's compliance with the Servicing Standard in making its determinations as to which strategy to execute.







 (c)           With respect to each Mortgage Loan (other than any Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan) or Serviced Loan Combination, if no Control Termination Event has occurred and is continuing, the Operating Advisor shall:



 (i)             promptly review all information available to Privileged Persons on the Certificate Administrator's Website relevant to the Operating Advisor's obligations under this Agreement;



 (ii)            promptly review each Final Asset Status Report; and



 (iii)           review any Appraisal Reduction Amount and net present value calculations pursuant to Section 3.31(e) of this Agreement.



 (d)           With respect to each Mortgage Loan (other than any Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan) or Serviced Loan Combination, while a Control Termination Event has occurred and is continuing, the Operating Advisor shall:



 (i)            consult (on a non-binding basis) with the Special Servicer in connection with any Major Decision pursuant to Section 6.07 of this Agreement;



 (ii)           review, recalculate and verify the accuracy of any Appraisal Reduction Amount and net present value calculations pursuant to Section 3.31(f) of this Agreement;



 (iii)          in connection with the preparation of the Operating Advisor Annual Report (defined below), review, in accordance with the Operating Advisor Standard, the Special Servicer's operational practices in respect of Specially Serviced Loans in order to formulate an opinion as to whether or not those operational practices generally satisfy the Servicing Standard with respect to the resolution and/or liquidation of the Specially Serviced Loans;



 (iv)       within 120 days of the end of the prior calendar year (if any such Mortgage Loans were Specially Serviced Loans during the prior calendar year), deliver an annual report setting forth the Operating Advisor's assessment of the Special Servicer's performance of its duties under this Agreement on a platform-level basis with respect to the resolution and liquidation of Specially Serviced Loans during the prior calendar year (the "Operating Advisor Annual Report") to the Trustee, the Master Servicer, the Certificate Administrator (which shall promptly post such Operating Advisor Annual Report on the Certificate Administrator's Website), the related Serviced Companion Loan Noteholder (if any) and the 17g-5 Information Provider (who shall promptly post such notice to the 17g-5 Information Provider's Website pursuant to Section 3.14(d) of this Agreement).  Each Operating Advisor Annual Report shall be substantially in the form of Exhibit X of this Agreement (which form may be modified or altered as to either its organization or content by the Operating Advisor, subject to compliance of such form with the terms and provisions of this Agreement) and shall be based on the Operating Advisor's review of any annual compliance statement and any assessment of compliance delivered to the Operating Advisor pursuant to Section 10.11 of this Agreement, as applicable, any attestation report delivered to the Operating Advisor pursuant to Section 10.13 of this Agreement, any Asset Status Report, other







 information (other than any communications between the Directing Holder and the Special Servicer that would be Privileged Information) delivered to the Operating Advisor by the Special Servicer and oral communications with the Special Servicer; provided that in no event shall the information or any other content included in the Operating Advisor Annual Report contravene any provision of this Agreement.  Subject to the restrictions in this Agreement, including, without limitation, Section 3.31(b) of this Agreement, each such Operating Advisor Annual Report shall (A) identify any material deviations (i) from the Servicing Standard and (ii) from the Special Servicer's obligations under this Agreement with respect to the resolution or liquidation of Specially Serviced Loans and (B) comply with all of the confidentiality requirements applicable to the Operating Advisor described in this Agreement.  Promptly upon receipt of each Operating Advisor Annual Report, the Certificate Administrator shall post such Operating Advisor Annual Report on the Certificate Administrator's Website.  Each of the Special Servicer and the Directing Holder (for so long as no Consultation Termination Event has occurred and is continuing) shall be given an opportunity to review any Operating Advisor Annual Report at least five Business Days prior to its delivery to the Trustee and the Certificate Administrator; provided, that the Operating Advisor shall have no obligation to consider any comments to such Operating Advisor Annual Report that are provided by the Special Servicer or Directing Holder.



 (e)           With respect to each Mortgage Loan (other than any Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan) or Serviced Loan Combination, if no Control Termination Event has occurred and is continuing, the Special Servicer will forward any Appraisal Reduction Amount and net present value calculations used in the Special Servicer's determination of what course of action to take in connection with the workout or liquidation of a Specially Serviced Loan to the Operating Advisor after such calculations have been finalized.  The Operating Advisor shall review such calculations but may not opine on, or otherwise call into question, such Appraisal Reduction Amount and/or net present value calculations (except that if the Operating Advisor discovers a mathematical error contained in such calculations, then the Operating Advisor shall notify the Special Servicer and the Controlling Class Representative of such error).



 (f)           With respect to each Mortgage Loan (other than any Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan) or Serviced Loan Combination, while a Control Termination Event has occurred and is continuing, after the calculation but prior to the utilization by the Special Servicer of any of the calculations related to (A) Appraisal Reduction Amounts or (B) net present value, the Special Servicer shall forward such calculations, together with any supporting material or additional information necessary in support thereof (including such additional information reasonably requested by the Operating Advisor to confirm the mathematical accuracy of such calculations, but not including any Privileged Information), to the Operating Advisor promptly, but in any event no later than 2 Business Days after finalizing the preparation of such calculations, and the Operating Advisor shall promptly, but no later than 3 Business Days after receipt of such calculations and any supporting or additional materials, recalculate and verify the accuracy of the mathematical calculations and the corresponding application of the non-discretionary portion of the applicable formulas required to be utilized in connection with any such calculation.







 In connection with this Section 3.31(f), if the Operating Advisor does not agree with the mathematical calculations or the application of the applicable non-discretionary portions of the formula required to be utilized for such calculation, the Operating Advisor and Special Servicer shall consult with each other in order to resolve any inaccuracy in the mathematical calculations or the application of the non-discretionary portions of the related formula in arriving at those mathematical calculations or any disagreement within 5 Business Days of delivery of such calculations to the Operating Advisor.  If the Operating Advisor and Special Servicer are not able to resolve such inaccuracies or disagreement prior to the end of such 5 Business Day period, the Operating Advisor shall promptly notify the Certificate Administrator of such disagreement and the Certificate Administrator shall examine the calculations and supporting materials provided by the Special Servicer and the Operating Advisor and shall determine which calculation is to apply.  In making such determination, the Certificate Administrator may hire an independent third-party to assist with any such calculation at the expense of the Trust and shall be entitled to conclusively rely on such third party's determination (provided such third party has been selected with reasonable care by the Certificate Administrator).



 (g)           Subject to the requirements of confidentiality imposed on the Operating Advisor herein (including without limitation in respect of Privileged Information), the Operating Advisor shall respond to Inquiries proposed by Privileged Persons from time to time in accordance with the terms of Section 4.02(c) of this Agreement.



 (h)           The Operating Advisor shall keep all Privileged Information confidential and shall not disclose such Privileged Information to any Person (including Certificateholders other than the Controlling Class Representative), other than (1) to the extent expressly required by this Agreement, to the other parties to this Agreement with a notice indicating that such information is Privileged Information or (2) pursuant to a Privileged Information Exception.  Each party to this Agreement that received Privileged Information from the Operating Advisor with a notice stating that such information is Privileged Information shall not disclose such Privileged Information to any Person without the prior written consent of the Special Servicer, the Controlling Class Representative and the Directing Holder other than pursuant to a Privileged Information Exception.



 (i)           On each Master Servicer Remittance Date, the Operating Advisor shall be paid the applicable Operating Advisor Fee from amounts on deposit in the Collection Account pursuant to Section 3.06 of this Agreement, as applicable.  In addition, the Operating Advisor Consulting Fee shall be payable to the Operating Advisor with respect to each Major Decision for which the Operating Advisor has consultation rights.  Each of the Operating Advisor Fee and the Operating Advisor Consulting Fee shall be payable from funds on deposit in the Collection Account as provided in Section 3.06 of this Agreement, but with respect to the Operating Advisor Consulting Fee only to the extent such Operating Advisor Consulting Fee is actually received from the related Borrower.  When the Operating Advisor has consultation rights with respect to a Major Decision under this Agreement, the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as applicable, shall use commercially reasonable efforts consistent with the Servicing Standard to collect the applicable Operating Advisor Consulting Fee from the related Borrower in connection with such Major Decision, but only to the extent not prohibited by the related Loan Documents.  The Master Servicer or Special Servicer, as applicable, may waive or reduce the amount of any Operating Advisor Consulting Fee payable by the related Borrower if it determines that such full







 or partial waiver is in accordance with the Servicing Standard, but in no event shall the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer take any enforcement action with respect to the collection of such Operating Advisor Consulting Fee other than requests for collection; provided that the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as applicable, shall consult with the Operating Advisor prior to any such waiver or reduction.

 (iv)         The various amounts distributable on the Class PEZ Certificates on each Distribution Date under the foregoing subsections of this Section 4.01(c) shall be so distributed in a single, aggregate distribution.



 (d)           On each Distribution Date, following the distribution from the Lower-Tier Distribution Account in respect of the Lower-Tier Regular Interests pursuant to Section 4.01(a) of this Agreement, the Certificate Administrator shall make distributions of any Prepayment Premiums and Yield Maintenance Charges received in the related Collection Period from amounts deposited in the Upper-Tier Distribution Account pursuant to Section 3.05(f) of this Agreement, as follows:



 Prepayment Premiums and Yield Maintenance Charges received with respect to the Mortgage Loans shall be distributed to the Class A-1, Class A-2, Class A-3, Class A-4, Class A-SB and Class D Certificates and the Class A-M, Class B and Class C Regular Interests, in an amount equal to, in the case of each such Class, the product of (a) a fraction, not greater than one, the numerator of which is the amount distributed as principal to such Class on such Distribution Date, and whose denominator is the total amount distributed as principal to the Class A-1, Class A-2, Class A-3, Class A-4, Class A-SB and Class D Certificates and the Class A-M, Class B and Class C Regular Interests on such Distribution Date, (b) the Base Interest Fraction for the related Principal Prepayment and such Class of Certificates or Regular Interest and (c) the aggregate amount of the Prepayment Premiums or the Yield Maintenance Charges, as applicable, collected on such Principal Prepayment during the related Collection Period.



 On each Distribution Date, any Yield Maintenance Charges or Prepayment Premiums distributed in respect of the Class A-M Regular Interest shall be further allocated between and distributed on the Class A-M Certificates and the Class PEZ Component A-M (and correspondingly on the Class PEZ Certificates), pro rata in proportion to the Class A-M Percentage Interest and Class A-M-PEZ Percentage Interest, respectively.  On each Distribution Date, any Yield Maintenance Charges or Prepayment Premiums distributed in respect of the Class B Regular Interest shall be further allocated between and distributed on the Class B Certificates and the Class PEZ Component B (and correspondingly on the Class PEZ Certificates), pro rata in proportion to the Class B Percentage Interest and Class B-PEZ Percentage Interest, respectively.  On each Distribution Date, any Yield Maintenance Charges or Prepayment Premiums distributed in respect of the Class C Regular Interest shall be further allocated between and distributed on the Class C Certificates and the Class PEZ Component C (and correspondingly on the Class PEZ Certificates), pro rata in proportion to the Class C Percentage Interest and Class C-PEZ Percentage Interest, respectively.



 Any Yield Maintenance Charges or Prepayment Premiums collected during the related Collection Period remaining after such distributions described in the preceding paragraphs (the "IO Group YM Distribution Amount") will be allocated in the following manner:







 (i)            to the Class X-A Certificates, in an amount equal to the product of (a) a fraction, the numerator of which is the aggregate amount of principal distributed on the Class A-1, Class A-2, Class A-SB, Class A-3 and Class A-4 Certificates and the Class A-M Regular Interests on such Distribution Date and the denominator of which is the total Principal Distribution Amount for such Distribution Date, multiplied by (b) the IO Group YM Distribution Amount; and



 (ii)           to the Class X-B Certificates, the IO Group YM Distribution Amount remaining after such distribution to the holders of the Class X-A Certificates described in (i) above.



 (e)           On each Distribution Date, the Certificate Administrator shall withdraw amounts from the Excess Liquidation Proceeds Account (or sub-account thereof) and shall distribute such amounts in the following manner:



 (i)           (A) from amounts in the Excess Liquidation Proceeds Account allocable to a Mortgage Loan (other than a Mortgage Loan related to a Serviced Loan Combination), to reimburse the Holders of the Regular Certificates (other than the Class X-A, Class X-B and Class X-C Certificates and the Exchangeable Certificates) and the Class EC Regular Interests (in the same order as that set forth in Section 4.01(b) of this Agreement and any amount so distributed on any Class EC Regular Interest shall be made correspondingly to the Class A-M, Class B or Class C Certificates and the component of the Class PEZ Certificates that correspond to such Class EC Regular Interest, pro rata, according to their respective Tranche Percentage Interest in such Class EC Regular Interest), up to an amount equal to all Realized Losses and Additional Trust Fund Expenses, if any, previously allocated to them and unreimbursed after application of Available Funds for such Distribution Date; and (B) from amounts in the Excess Liquidation Proceeds Account allocable to the Serviced Loan Combinations, first, in accordance with the terms of the related Intercreditor Agreement, and then, to the extent allocated to the related Mortgage Loan, pursuant to the terms of such Intercreditor Agreement, to reimburse the Holders of the Regular Certificates (other than the Class A-M, Class B, Class C, Class X-A, Class X-B and Class X-C Certificates and the Exchangeable Certificates) and the Class EC Regular Interests (in the same order as that set forth in Section 4.01(b) of this Agreement and any amount so distributed on any Class EC Regular Interest shall be made correspondingly to the Class A-M, Class B or Class C Certificates and the component of the Class PEZ Certificates that correspond to such Class EC Regular Interest, pro rata, according to their respective Tranche Percentage Interest in such Class EC Regular Interest), up to an amount equal to all Realized Losses and Additional Trust Fund Expenses, if any, previously allocated to them and unreimbursed after application of Available Funds for such Distribution Date; and



 (ii)          any amounts remaining in the Excess Liquidation Proceeds Account after such distributions on any Distribution Date that (A) are allocable to the Mortgage Loans, shall be held and maintained in such account and applied to offset future Realized Losses and Additional Trust Fund Expenses from time to time; and (B) are allocable to the Serviced Companion Loans, shall be remitted within one Business Day after each such Distribution Date by the Certificate Administrator to the Master Servicer (which shall







 remit to the Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders in accordance with Section 3.05(h)).  On any Distribution Date, amounts held in the Excess Liquidation Proceeds Account (other than amounts allocable to any related Serviced Companion Loan pursuant to the terms of any related Intercreditor Agreement) that exceed amounts reasonably required to offset future Realized Losses and Additional Trust Fund Expenses shall be distributed to the Holders of the Class LR Certificates and upon termination of the Trust Fund, any amounts remaining in the Excess Liquidation Proceeds Account (other than amounts allocable to any related Serviced Companion Loan pursuant to the terms of any related Intercreditor Agreement) shall be distributed by the Certificate Administrator to the Class LR Certificates.  Amounts paid with respect to the Mortgage Loans from the Excess Liquidation Proceeds Account pursuant to the preceding clauses (i) and (ii) shall first be deemed to have been distributed to the Lower-Tier Regular Interests in reimbursement of Realized Losses and Additional Trust Fund Expenses previously allocated thereto in the same manner as provided in Section 4.01(a) of this Agreement.  Amounts paid from the Excess Liquidation Proceeds Account will not reduce the Certificate Balances of any Class of Regular Certificates or any of the Class EC Regular Interest receiving such distributions.



 (f)           On each Distribution Date, immediately following the distributions to be made on such date pursuant to Section 4.01(b), the Certificate Administrator shall calculate the amount, if any, of Realized Losses.  Any allocation of Realized Losses to any Class of Regular Certificates (other than the Exchangeable Certificates) and the Class EC Regular Interests (and consequently, to the corresponding Classes of Exchangeable Certificates) shall be made by reducing the Certificate Balance thereof by the amount so allocated.  Any Realized Losses so allocated to any Class of Regular Certificates and the Class EC Regular Interests (and consequently, to the corresponding Classes of Exchangeable Certificates) shall be allocated among the respective Certificates of such Class in proportion to the Percentage Interests evidenced thereby.  The allocation of Realized Losses shall constitute an allocation of losses and other shortfalls experienced by the Trust Fund.  Reimbursement of previously allocated Realized Losses will not constitute distributions of principal for any purpose and will not result in an additional reduction in the Certificate Balance of the Class of Certificates or Regular Interests in respect of which any such reimbursement is made.  To the extent any Nonrecoverable Advances (plus interest thereon) that were reimbursed from principal collections on the Mortgage Loans and previously resulted in a reduction of the Principal Distribution Amount are subsequently recovered on the related Mortgage Loan, the amount of such recovery will be added to the Certificate Balance of such Classes of Regular Certificates or Regular Interests that previously were allocated Realized Losses, first, to the Class A-1, Class A-2, Class A-3, Class A-4 and Class A-SB Certificates, pro rata, then, to the Class A-M Regular Interest (and, correspondingly, the Class A-M Certificates and the Class PEZ Component A-M, pro rata based on their respective Tranche Percentage Interests therein), then, to the Class B Regular Interest (and, correspondingly, the Class B Certificates and the Class PEZ Component B, pro rata based on their respective Tranche Percentage Interests therein), then, to the Class C Regular Interest (and, correspondingly, the Class C Certificates and the Class PEZ Component C, pro rata based on their respective Tranche Percentage Interests therein) and then, to the remainder of the Regular Certificates (other than the Class X-A, Class X-B and Class X-C Certificates) in sequential order, in each case up to the amount of the unreimbursed Realized Losses allocated to such Class of Certificates or such Regular Interest.  If the Certificate Balance of any Class of Certificates or







 any Regular Interest is so increased, the amount of unreimbursed Realized Losses of such Class of Certificates or such Regular Interest shall be decreased by such amount.



 The Certificate Balances of each Class of Regular Certificates (other than the Class X-A, Class X-B and Class X-C Certificates) and Regular Interests will be reduced without distribution on any Distribution Date as a write-off to the extent of any Realized Losses allocated to such Class of Certificates or Regular Interests with respect to such date.  Any such write-offs will be applied to the Classes of Regular Certificates (other than the Class X-A, Class X-B and Class X-C Certificates and the Exchangeable Certificates) and the Class EC Regular Interests in the following order, in each case until the Certificate Balance of such Class or Regular Interest is reduced to zero: first, to the Class G Certificates; second, to the Class F Certificates; third, to the Class E Certificates; fourth, to the Class D Certificates; fifth, to the Class C Regular Interest (and, correspondingly, the Class C Certificates and the Class PEZ Component C, pro rata based on their respective Tranche Percentage Interests therein); sixth, to the Class B Regular Interest (and, correspondingly, the Class B Certificates and the Class PEZ Component B, pro rata based on their respective Tranche Percentage Interests therein); seventh, to the Class A-M Regular Interest (and, correspondingly, the Class A-M Certificates and the Class PEZ Component A-M, pro rata based on their respective Tranche Percentage Interests therein); and finally, to the Class A-1, Class A-2, Class A-3 and Class A-4 Certificates, pro rata, based on their respective Certificate Balances.  Any amounts recovered in respect of amounts previously written off as Realized Losses shall be distributed on the Classes of Regular Certificates (other than the Class X-A, Class X-B and Class X-C Certificates) and Regular Interests in reverse order of allocation of Realized Losses thereto in accordance with Section 4.01(b) of this Agreement (and any amounts so distributed on any Class EC Regular Interest shall be distributed on Class of Class A-M, Class B or Class C Certificates corresponding to that Class EC Regular Interest and the corresponding component of the Class PEZ Certificates, pro rata based on their respective Tranche Percentage Interests in such Class EC Regular Interest).  Additional Trust Fund Expenses and shortfalls in Available Funds due to extraordinary expenses of the Trust Fund (including indemnification expenses), a reduction in the Mortgage Rate on a Mortgage Loan by a bankruptcy court pursuant to a plan of reorganization or pursuant to any of its equitable powers, or otherwise, shall be treated as and allocated in the same manner as Realized Losses.



 With respect to any Distribution Date, any Realized Losses allocated pursuant to Section 3.06 of this Agreement with respect to such Distribution Date shall reduce the Lower-Tier Principal Balances of the Lower-Tier Regular Interests as a write-off and shall be allocated among the Lower-Tier Regular Interests in the same priority as the Class of Corresponding Certificates.



 (g)           All amounts distributable to a Class of Certificates pursuant to this Section 4.01 on each Distribution Date shall be allocated pro rata among the outstanding Certificates in each such Class based on their respective Percentage Interests.  Such distributions shall be made on each Distribution Date other than the Termination Date to each Certificateholder of record on the related Record Date, (i) by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account of such Holder at a bank or other entity located in the United States and having appropriate facilities therefor if such Holder shall have provided the Paying Agent with wire instructions in writing at least five Business Days prior to the related Record Date, or (ii) otherwise, by check mailed by first-class mail to the address set forth therefor in the







 Certificate Register.  The final distribution on each Certificate shall be made in like manner, but only upon presentment and surrender of such Certificate at the office of the Certificate Administrator or its agent (which may be the Paying Agent or the Certificate Registrar acting as such agent) that is specified in the notice to Holders of such final distribution.



 (h)           Except as otherwise provided in Section 9.01 with respect to an Anticipated Termination Date, the Certificate Administrator shall, as soon as reasonably practicable within the month preceding the month in which the final distribution with respect to any Class of Certificates is expected to be made, mail to each Holder of such Class of Certificates on such date a notice to the effect that:



 (A)           the Certificate Administrator reasonably expects based upon information previously provided to it that the final distribution with respect to such Class of Certificates will be made on such Distribution Date, but only upon presentation and surrender of such Certificates at the office of the Certificate Administrator therein specified, and



 (B)           if such final distribution is made on such Distribution Date, no interest shall accrue on such Certificates from and after such Distribution Date;



 provided that the Class R and Class LR Certificates shall remain outstanding until none of the Certificates, the Lower-Tier Regular Interests or the Class EC Regular Interests remain outstanding.



 Any funds not distributed to any Holder or Holders of such Classes of Certificates on such Distribution Date because of the failure of such Holder or Holders to tender their Certificates shall, on such date, be set aside and held for the benefit of the appropriate non-tendering Holder or Holders.  If any Certificates as to which notice has been given pursuant to this Section 4.01(h) shall not have been surrendered for cancellation within six months after the time specified in such notice, the Certificate Administrator shall mail a second notice to the remaining non-tendering Holders to surrender their Certificates for cancellation to receive the final distribution with respect thereto.  If within one year after the second notice not all of such Certificates shall have been surrendered for cancellation, the Certificate Administrator may, directly or through an agent, take appropriate steps to contact the remaining non-tendering Holders concerning surrender of their Certificates.  The costs and expenses of holding such funds and of contacting such Holders shall be paid out of such funds.  If within two years after the second notice any such Certificates shall not have been surrendered for cancellation, the Paying Agent shall distribute to the Certificate Administrator all amounts distributable to the Holders thereof, and the Certificate Administrator shall thereafter hold such amounts for the benefit of such Holders until the earlier of (i) its termination as Certificate Administrator hereunder and the transfer of such amounts to a successor Certificate Administrator and (ii) the termination of the Trust Fund and distribution of such amounts to the Class R Certificateholders.  No interest shall accrue or be payable to any Holder on any amount held hereunder or by the Certificate Administrator as a result of such Holder's failure to surrender its Certificate(s) for final payment thereof in accordance with this Section 4.01(h).  Any such amounts transferred to the Certificate Administrator may be invested in Permitted Investments and all income and gain realized from investment of such funds shall accrue for its benefit.







 (i)           Shortfalls in Available Funds resulting from Excess Prepayment Interest Shortfalls shall be allocated to, and Master Servicer Prepayment Interest Shortfall Amounts shall be deemed distributed to, each Class of Regular Certificates (other than the Exchangeable Certificates), the Class A-M Regular Interest (and, correspondingly, the Class A-M Certificates and the Class PEZ Component A-M, pro rata based on their respective Tranche Percentage Interests therein), the Class B Regular Interest (and, correspondingly, the Class B Certificates and the Class PEZ Component B, pro rata based on their respective Tranche Percentage Interests therein) and the Class C Regular Interest (and, correspondingly, the Class C Certificates and the Class PEZ Component C, pro rata based on their respective Tranche Percentage Interests therein) and, in each case, correspondingly to the respective Class of Corresponding Lower-Tier Regular Interests, pro rata, based upon the Interest Accrual Amount distributable to each such Class of Certificates or Regular Interest prior to reduction by such Excess Prepayment Interest Shortfalls.  Master Servicer Prepayment Interest Shortfall Amounts shall be deposited by the Master Servicer into the Collection Account on or prior to the Servicer Remittance Date.



 (j)           On the final Servicer Remittance Date, the Master Servicer shall withdraw from the Collection Account and deliver to the Certificate Administrator who shall distribute to the Mortgage Loan Sellers, any Loss of Value Payments relating to the Mortgage Loans that it is servicing and that were transferred from the Loss of Value Reserve Fund to the Collection Account on the immediately preceding Servicer Remittance Date in accordance with Section 3.06(e)(v) of this Agreement.

In addition, the Class PEZ Certificates shall be allocated the aggregate amount of Realized Losses, Net Prepayment Interest Shortfalls and other interest shortfalls (including those resulting from Appraisal Reduction Events) that are allocated to the Class PEZ Components pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.



 (m)           On each Distribution Date, any Excess Interest received with respect to the Mortgage Loans during the related Collection Period shall be distributed to the Holders of the Class V Certificates from the Class V Distribution Account established pursuant to Section 3.05(k).  Any Excess Interest remaining in the Class V Distribution Account on the final Distribution Date shall be distributed to the Holders of the Class V Certificates.

In connection with providing access to the Master Servicer's Website, the Master Servicer may require registration and the acceptance of a disclaimer and otherwise (subject to the preceding sentence) adopt reasonable rules and procedures, which may include, to the extent the Master Servicer deems necessary or appropriate, conditioning access on execution of an agreement governing the availability, use and disclosure of such information, and which may provide indemnification to the Master Servicer for any liability or damage that may arise therefrom.  The Master Servicer shall not be liable for dissemination of this information in accordance with this Agreement, provided that such information otherwise meets the







 requirements set forth herein with respect to the form and substance of such information or reports.

Neither the Certificate Administrator nor the Depositor shall have any obligation to recompute, verify or recalculate the information provided thereto by the Master Servicer.

 (ii)          the most recent annual (or more frequent, if available) operating statements, rent rolls (to the extent such rent rolls have been made available by the related Borrower) and/or lease summaries and retail sales information, if any, received from the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer in respect to each Mortgaged Property;



 (iii)         the Mortgage File, including any and all modifications, waivers and amendments of the terms of a Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination entered into by the Master Servicer and/or the Special Servicer and delivered to the Certificate Administrator; and



 (iv)         any other information that may be necessary to satisfy the requirements of subsection (d)(4)(i) of Rule 144A under the Securities Act.



 Copies of any and all of the foregoing items will be available from the Certificate Administrator upon request.  The Certificate Administrator will be permitted to require payment by the requesting party (other than a Rating Agency) of a sum sufficient to cover the reasonable costs and expenses of making such information available and providing any copies thereof.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Paying Agent shall comply with all federal withholding requirements with respect to payments to Certificateholders of interest, original issue discount or other amounts that the Paying Agent reasonably believes are applicable under the Code.  The consent of Certificateholders shall not be required for any such withholding.  If the Paying Agent or its agent withholds any amount from interest, original issue discount payments or other amounts or advances thereof to any Certificateholder pursuant to federal withholding requirements, the Paying Agent shall indicate the amount withheld to such Certificateholder.

 Section 4.04         REMIC Compliance.  (a)  The parties intend that each of the Lower-Tier REMIC and the Upper-Tier REMIC shall constitute, and that the affairs of each of the Lower-Tier REMIC and the Upper-Tier REMIC shall be conducted so as to qualify it as, a "real estate mortgage investment conduit" as defined in, and in accordance with, the REMIC Provisions at all times any Certificates are outstanding, and the provisions hereof shall be interpreted consistently with this intention.  In furtherance of such intention, the Certificate Administrator shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, act as agent, and is hereby appointed to act as agent, of each such REMIC and shall on behalf of each such REMIC:



 (i)           make or cause to be made an election, on behalf of each of the Lower-Tier REMIC and the Upper-Tier REMIC, to be treated as a REMIC on Form 1066 for its first taxable year, in accordance with the REMIC Provisions;



 (ii)          prepare and timely file, or cause to be prepared and timely filed, and cause the Trustee to sign (and the Trustee shall sign), all required Tax Returns for the Lower-Tier REMIC and the Upper-Tier REMIC, using a calendar year as the taxable year for each of such REMIC as required by the REMIC Provisions and other applicable federal, state or local income tax laws;



 (iii)         prepare and forward, or cause to be prepared and forwarded, to the Certificateholders and the IRS and applicable state and local tax authorities all information reports as and when required to be provided to them in accordance with the REMIC Provisions;



 (iv)         if the filing or distribution of any documents of an administrative nature not addressed in clauses (i) through (iii) of this Section 4.04(a) is then required by the REMIC Provisions in order to maintain the status of the Lower-Tier REMIC and the Upper-Tier REMIC as a REMIC or is otherwise required by the Code, prepare and file or distribute, or cause to be prepared and signed and filed or distributed, such documents with or to such Persons when and as required by the REMIC Provisions or the Code or comparable provisions of state and local law;



 (v)          within 30 days of the Closing Date, obtain a taxpayer identification number for each of the Lower-Tier REMIC and the Upper-Tier REMIC on IRS Form SS-4 and (in the case of the Upper-Tier REMIC only), furnish or cause to be furnished to the IRS, on Form 8811 or as otherwise may be required by the Code, the name, title and address of the person that the Certificateholders may contact for tax information relating thereto (and the Certificate Administrator shall act as the representative of the Upper-Tier REMIC for this purpose), together with such additional information as may be required by such Form, and shall update such information at the time or times and in the manner required by the Code (and the Depositor agrees within 10 Business Days of the Closing Date to provide any information reasonably requested by the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer or the Certificate Administrator and necessary to make such filing); and



 (vi)         maintain such records relating to the Lower-Tier REMIC and the Upper-Tier REMIC as may be necessary to prepare the foregoing returns, schedules, statements or information, such records, for federal income tax purposes, to be maintained on a calendar year and on an accrual basis.







 The Holder of the largest Percentage Interest in the Class R Certificates shall be the tax matters person of the Upper-Tier REMIC, and the Holder of the largest Percentage Interest in the Class LR Certificates shall be the tax matters person of the Lower-Tier REMIC pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section 1.860F-4(d).  If more than one Holder shall hold an equal Percentage Interest in the Class R or Class LR Certificates larger than that held by any other Holder, the first such Holder to have acquired such Class R or Class LR Certificates shall be such tax matters person.  The Certificate Administrator shall act as attorney-in-fact and agent for the tax matters person of the Lower-Tier REMIC and the Upper-Tier REMIC, and each Holder of a Percentage Interest in the Class R or Class LR Certificates, by acceptance hereof, is deemed to have consented to the Certificate Administrator's appointment in such capacity and agrees to execute any documents required to give effect thereto, and any fees and expenses incurred by the Certificate Administrator in connection with any audit or administrative or judicial proceeding shall be paid by the Trust Fund.



 The Certificate Administrator shall not intentionally take any action or intentionally omit to take any action if, in taking or omitting to take such action, the Certificate Administrator has actual knowledge that such action or omission (as the case may be) would cause the termination of the REMIC status of the Lower-Tier REMIC or the Upper-Tier REMIC or the imposition of tax on the Lower-Tier REMIC or the Upper-Tier REMIC (other than a tax on income expressly permitted to be received by the terms of this Agreement).  Notwithstanding any provision of this paragraph to the contrary, the Certificate Administrator shall not be required to take any action that the Certificate Administrator in good faith believes to be inconsistent with any other provision of this Agreement, nor shall the Certificate Administrator be deemed in violation of this paragraph if it takes any action expressly required or authorized by any other provision of this Agreement, and the Certificate Administrator shall have no responsibility or liability with respect to any act or omission of the Depositor, the Trustee, the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer which does not enable the Certificate Administrator to comply with any of clauses (i) through (vi) of the first paragraph of this Section 4.04(a) or which results in any action contemplated by clauses (i) or (ii) of the next succeeding sentence.  In this regard the Certificate Administrator shall (i) exercise reasonable care not to allow the occurrence of any "prohibited transactions" within the meaning of Section 860F(a) of the Code, unless the party seeking such action shall have delivered to the Certificate Administrator an Opinion of Counsel (at such party's expense) that such occurrence would not (A) result in a taxable gain, (B) otherwise subject the Lower-Tier REMIC or the Upper-Tier REMIC to tax (other than a tax at the highest marginal corporate tax rate on net income from foreclosure property), or (c) cause the Lower-Tier REMIC or the Upper-Tier REMIC to fail to qualify as a REMIC; and (ii) exercise reasonable care not to allow the Trust Fund to receive any contributions, or any income from the performance of services or from assets not permitted under the REMIC Provisions to be held by a REMIC (provided, that the receipt of any income expressly permitted or contemplated by the terms of this Agreement shall not be deemed to violate this clause).  None of the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Trustee or the Depositor shall be (i) permitted to take any action that the Certificate Administrator would not be permitted to take pursuant to the preceding two sentences or (ii) responsible or liable (except in connection with taking any act or omission referred to in the two preceding sentences or the following sentence) for any failure by the Certificate Administrator to comply with the provisions of this Section 4.04.  The Depositor, the Trustee, the Master Servicer and the Special Servicer shall cooperate in a timely manner with the Certificate Administrator in supplying any information







 within the Depositor's, the Trustee's, the Master Servicer's or the Special Servicer's control (other than any confidential information) that is reasonably necessary to enable the Certificate Administrator to perform its duties under this Section 4.04.



 (b)           The following assumptions are to be used for purposes of determining the anticipated payments of principal and interest for calculating the original yield to maturity and original issue discount with respect to the Regular Certificates:  (i) each Mortgage Loan will pay principal and interest in accordance with its terms and scheduled payments will be timely received on their Due Dates, provided that the Mortgage Loans will prepay in accordance with the Prepayment Assumption; (ii) none of the Sole Certificateholder, the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer and the Certificateholder owning a majority of the Percentage Interests in the Controlling Class will exercise the right described in Section 9.01 of this Agreement to cause early termination of the Trust Fund; and (iii) no Mortgage Loan is repurchased by a Mortgage Loan Seller pursuant to the terms of the related Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement.



 Section 4.05        Imposition of Tax on the Trust Fund.  If any tax, including interest, penalties or assessments, additional amounts or additions to tax, is imposed on the Lower-Tier REMIC or the Upper-Tier REMIC, such tax shall be charged against amounts otherwise distributable to the Holders of the Certificates; provided that any taxes imposed on any net income from foreclosure property pursuant to Section 860G(d) of the Code or any similar tax imposed by a state or local jurisdiction shall instead be treated as an expense of the related Serviced REO Property in determining Net REO Proceeds with respect to the Serviced REO Property (and until such taxes are paid, the Special Servicer from time to time shall withdraw from amounts in the REO Account (and, in the case of any Serviced Loan Combination, from amounts in the Serviced Loan Combination REO Account) allocable to the Mortgage Loans and transfer to the Certificate Administrator amounts reasonably determined by the Certificate Administrator to be necessary to pay such taxes, which the Certificate Administrator shall maintain in a separate, non-interest-bearing account, and the Certificate Administrator shall send to the Special Servicer for deposit in the REO Account (or, if applicable, the Serviced Loan Combination REO Account) the excess determined by the Certificate Administrator from time to time of the amount in such account over the amount necessary to pay such taxes) and shall be paid therefrom; provided that any such tax imposed on net income from foreclosure property that exceeds the amount in any such reserve shall be retained from Available Funds as provided in Section 3.06(a)(xii) or, in the case of any Serviced Loan Combination, in Section 3.06(b)(xiii), and the next sentence.  Except as provided in the preceding sentence, the Certificate Administrator is hereby authorized to and shall retain or cause to be retained from Available Funds sufficient funds to pay or provide for the payment of, and to actually pay, such tax as is legally owed by the applicable REMIC (but such authorization shall not prevent the Trustee from contesting, at the expense of the Trust Fund or in the case of a Serviced Loan Combination with a Serviced Companion Loan, on a pro rata basis as between the related Mortgage Loan and any related Serviced Companion Loan (based on their respective outstanding principal balances)) any such tax in appropriate proceedings, and withholding payment of such tax, if permitted by law, pending the outcome of such proceedings).  The Certificate Administrator is hereby authorized to and shall segregate or cause to be segregated, into a separate non-interest bearing account, (i) the net income allocable to the Mortgage Loans from any "prohibited transaction" under Section 860F(a) of the Code or (ii) the amount of any contribution to the Lower-Tier REMIC or the Upper-Tier REMIC after the Startup Day that is subject to tax under Section 860G(d) of the







 Code and use such income or amount, to the extent necessary, to pay such tax (and return the balance thereof, if any, to the Collection Account, the Lower-Tier Distribution Account or the Upper-Tier Distribution Account, as the case may be).  To the extent that any such tax is paid to the IRS, the Certificate Administrator shall retain an equal amount from future amounts otherwise distributable to the Holders of the Class R or the Class LR Certificates, as the case may be, and shall distribute such retained amounts to the Holders of Regular Certificates, or the Trustee as Holder of the Lower-Tier Regular Interests and the Regular Interests, until they are fully reimbursed and then to the Holders of the Class R Certificates or the Class LR Certificates, as applicable.  Neither the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Certificate Administrator, nor the Trustee shall be responsible for any taxes imposed on the Lower-Tier REMIC or the Upper-Tier REMIC except to the extent such tax is attributable to a breach of a representation or warranty or the negligence or willful misconduct of the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Certificate Administrator or the Trustee or an act or omission of the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Certificate Administrator or the Trustee in contravention of this Agreement, provided, further, that such breach, act or omission could result in liability under Section 6.03 of this Agreement, in the case of the Master Servicer, Section 4.04 of this Agreement, in the case of the Trustee or Section 4.04 of this Agreement, in the case of the Certificate Administrator in accordance with the standard of liability set forth in those sections.  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in each such case, the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer shall not be responsible for the Trustee's or the Certificate Administrator's breaches, acts or omissions, the Trustee shall not be responsible for the breaches, acts or omissions of the Certificate Administrator, the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer and the Certificate Administrator shall not be responsible for the breaches, acts or omissions of the Trustee, the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer.



 Section 4.06       Remittances.  On the Servicer Remittance Date immediately preceding each Distribution Date, the Master Servicer with respect to the Mortgage Loans that it is servicing shall:



 (i)       remit to the Certificate Administrator for deposit in the Lower-Tier Distribution Account an amount equal to Prepayment Premiums and Yield Maintenance Charges, and, for deposit in accordance with Section 3.05(i) of this Agreement, Excess Liquidation Proceeds, in each case received by the Master Servicer in its Collection Period preceding such Distribution Date;



 (ii)       remit to the Certificate Administrator for deposit in the Lower-Tier Distribution Account an amount equal to the Available Funds for such Distribution Date;



 (iii)       remit to the Certificate Administrator for deposit in the Class V Distribution Account an amount equal to the Excess Interest for the benefit of the Class V Certificateholders received by the Master Servicer in the Collection Period preceding such Distribution Date;



 (iv)       remit to CREFC® the CREFC® License Fee; and



 (v)       remit to CCRE, or any successor, assignee or designee of all or a portion CCRE's right to receive the CCRE Strips, the CCRE Strips with respect to the related Collection Period.







 Section 4.07       P&I Advances.  (a)  On or before 3:00 pxxPDmxxPD (New York City time) on each Servicer Remittance Date, the Master Servicer shall in the case of all Mortgage Loans either (i) remit to the Certificate Administrator for deposit into the Lower-Tier Distribution Account from its own funds an amount equal to the aggregate amount of P&I Advances, if any, to be made in respect of the related Distribution Date, (ii) apply amounts held in the Collection Account or the applicable Serviced Loan Combination Collection Account for future distribution to Certificateholders in subsequent months in discharge of any such obligation to make P&I Advances; provided, that such amounts in the applicable Serviced Loan Combination Collection Account shall only be applied up to the related Mortgage Loan's pro rata share of the amounts held therein on such date, or (iii) make P&I Advances in the form of any combination of (i) and (ii) aggregating the total amount of P&I Advances to be made by the Master Servicer, except that the portion of such P&I Advance equal to the CREFC® License Fee for each such Mortgage Loan shall not be remitted to the Certificate Administrator but shall instead be remitted to CREFC®.  Any amounts held in the Collection Account or any Serviced Loan Combination Collection Account, as applicable, for future distribution and so used to make P&I Advances shall be appropriately reflected in the Master Servicer's records and replaced by the Master Servicer by deposit in the Collection Account or the applicable Serviced Loan Combination Collection Account, as applicable, on or before the next succeeding P&I Advance Determination Date (to the extent not previously replaced through either (x) the deposit of Late Collections of the delinquent principal and/or interest in respect of which such P&I Advances were made or (y) the deposit of Monthly Payments collected prior to the expiration of any applicable grace period that ends after the P&I Advance Determination Date in respect of which such P&I Advances were made).  The Master Servicer shall notify the Trustee and the Certificate Administrator of (i) the aggregate amount of P&I Advances for a Distribution Date and (ii) the amount of any Nonrecoverable P&I Advances for such Distribution Date, on or before the P&I Advance Determination Date.  If the Master Servicer fails to make a required P&I Advance by 3:00 pxxPDmxxPD (New York City time) on any Servicer Remittance Date, then the Trustee shall make such P&I Advance pursuant to Section 7.06 of this Agreement by 12:00 noon (New York City time) on the related Distribution Date, in each case unless the Master Servicer shall have cured such failure (and shall have provided written notice of such cure to the Trustee) by 11:00 axxPDmxxPD (New York City time) on such Distribution Date or the Trustee determines that such P&I Advance, if made, would be a Nonrecoverable Advance.  Neither the Master Servicer nor the Trustee shall be required to make P&I Advances on any Companion Loan.  If the Master Servicer or the Trustee makes a P&I Advance with respect to any Mortgage Loan that is part of a Loan Combination with a related Serviced Companion Loan or Non-Serviced Companion Loan, then it shall provide written notice to the related Other Servicer, Other Special Servicer and Other Trustee of the amount of such P&I Advance with respect to such Mortgage Loan within two (2) Business Days of making such P&I Advance.



 (b)           Subject to Section 4.07(c) and 4.07(d) below, the aggregate amount of P&I Advances to be made by the Master Servicer with respect to any Distribution Date shall equal the aggregate of:  (i) all Monthly Payments with respect to the Mortgage Loans (in each case, net of related Servicing Fees, in the case of any Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan, net of the servicing fees pursuant to the applicable Other Pooling and Servicing Agreement and, in the case of the Mortgage Loans that are part of the CCRE Strip Pool, net of the CCRE Strips) other than Balloon Payments, that were due during the related Collection Period and delinquent (or unpaid, pending the expiration of any applicable grace period with respect to any Mortgage Loan having







 a grace period extending past the P&I Advance Determination Date) as of the close of business on the P&I Advance Determination Date (or not advanced by the Master Servicer or any sub-servicer on behalf of the Master Servicer) with respect to the Mortgage Loans that it is servicing and (ii) with respect to each Mortgage Loan that the Master Servicer is servicing and as to which the related Balloon Payment was due during or prior to the related Collection Period and was delinquent (including any applicable grace period) as of the end of the related Collection Period (including any REO Loan as to which the Balloon Payment would have been past due), an amount equal to the Assumed Scheduled Payment therefor.  Subject to subsection (c) below, the obligation of the Master Servicer to make such P&I Advances, with respect to the Mortgage Loans that it is servicing, is mandatory, and with respect to any applicable Mortgage Loan or REO Loan, shall continue until the Distribution Date on which Liquidation Proceeds or REO Proceeds, if any, are to be distributed.  The Monthly Payment or Assumed Scheduled Payment shall be reduced, for purposes of P&I Advances, by any modifications pursuant to Section 3.26 of this Agreement or otherwise and by any reductions by a bankruptcy court pursuant to a plan of reorganization or pursuant to any of its equitable powers.



 (c)           Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no P&I Advance shall be required hereunder if the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer or the Trustee, as applicable, determines that such P&I Advance would, if made, constitute a Nonrecoverable P&I Advance.  In addition, the Master Servicer shall not make any P&I Advance to the extent that it has received written notice that the Special Servicer has determined (if no Consultation Termination Event has occurred and is continuing, in consultation with the Directing Holder) that such P&I Advance would, if made, constitute a Nonrecoverable P&I Advance.  In making such recoverability determination, the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer and the Trustee, as applicable, will be entitled to (i) give due regard to the existence of any Nonrecoverable Advance or Workout-Delayed Reimbursement Amount with respect to other Mortgage Loans, the recovery of which, at the time of such consideration, is being deferred or delayed by the Master Servicer or the Trustee, as applicable, in light of the fact that proceeds on the related Mortgage Loan are a source of recovery not only for the P&I Advance under consideration, but also as a potential source of recovery of such Nonrecoverable Advance or Workout-Delayed Reimbursement Amount which is being or may be deferred or delayed, (ii) consider (among other things) the obligations of the Borrower under the terms of the related Mortgage Loan (or the Loan Combination, as applicable) as it may have been modified, (iii) consider (among other things) the related Mortgaged Properties in their "as is" or then current conditions and occupancies, as modified by such party's assumptions (consistent with the Servicing Standard in the case of the Master Servicer and the Special Servicer) regarding the possibility and effects of future adverse change with respect to such Mortgaged Properties, (iv) estimate and consider (consistent with the Servicing Standard in the case of the Master Servicer and the Special Servicer) (among other things) future expenses and (v) estimate and consider (among other things) the timing of recoveries.



 The Master Servicer, the Special Servicer and the Trustee, as applicable, shall consider Unliquidated Advances in respect of prior P&I Advances for purposes of nonrecoverability determinations as if such Unliquidated Advances were unreimbursed P&I Advances.  None of the Master Servicer or Trustee shall make any P&I Advances with respect to delinquent amounts due on any Companion Loan.  If an Appraisal of the related Mortgaged Property shall not have been obtained within the prior 9-month period (and the Master Servicer







 and the Trustee shall each request any such appraisal from the Special Servicer prior to ordering an Appraisal pursuant to this sentence) or if such an Appraisal shall have been obtained but as a result of unforeseen occurrences, such Appraisal does not, in the good faith determination of the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer or the Trustee, reflect current market conditions, and the Master Servicer or the Trustee, as applicable, and the Special Servicer cannot agree on the appropriate downward adjustment to such Appraisal, the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer or the Trustee, as the case may be, may, subject to its reasonable and good faith determination that such Appraisal will demonstrate the nonrecoverability of the related Advance, obtain an Appraisal for such purpose at the expense of the Trust Fund (subject, in the case of any Serviced Loan Combination, to the allocation provisions of the related Intercreditor Agreement).



 Any such determination by the Master Servicer, Special Servicer or the Trustee that the Master Servicer or Trustee, as applicable, has made a Nonrecoverable P&I Advance or that any proposed P&I Advance, if made, would constitute a Nonrecoverable P&I Advance shall be evidenced by a certificate of a Servicing Officer delivered to the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator, the Operating Advisor, the Special Servicer, the Controlling Class Representative (but only if no Consultation Termination Event has occurred and is continuing) and the Depositor and, in the case of the Trustee, by a certificate of a Responsible Officer of the Trustee, delivered to the Depositor, the Controlling Class Representative (but only if no Consultation Termination Event has occurred and is continuing), the Operating Advisor, the Certificate Administrator, the Master Servicer and the Special Servicer, which in each case sets forth such nonrecoverability determination and the considerations of the Master Servicer, Special Servicer or the Trustee, as applicable, forming the basis of such determination (such certificate accompanied by, to the extent available, income and expense statements, rent rolls, occupancy status, property inspections and other information used by the Master Servicer, Special Servicer or the Trustee, as applicable, to make such determination, together with any existing Appraisal or any Updated Appraisal); provided, that the Special Servicer may, at its option, make a determination in accordance with the Servicing Standard, that any P&I Advance previously made or proposed to be made is nonrecoverable and shall deliver to the Master Servicer, the Controlling Class Representative (but only if no Consultation Termination Event has occurred and is continuing), the Operating Advisor, the Certificate Administrator, the Trustee and the 17g-5 Information Provider (who shall promptly post such notice to the 17g-5 Information Provider's Website pursuant to Section 3.14(d) of this Agreement), notice of such determination, together with a certificate of a Servicing Officer and the supporting information described above.  Any such determination shall be conclusive and binding on the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer and the Trustee.



 Any such Person may update or change its recoverability determinations at any time (but not reverse any other Person's determination that a P&I Advance is a Nonrecoverable Advance) and (consistent with the Servicing Standard in the case of the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer) may obtain, at the expense of the Trust Fund (subject, in the case of any Serviced Loan Combination, to the allocation provisions of the related Intercreditor Agreement), any analysis, Appraisals or market value estimates or other information for such purposes.  Absent bad faith, any such determination as to the recoverability of any P&I Advance shall be conclusive and binding on the Certificateholders.







 Notwithstanding the above, (i) the Trustee shall be entitled to rely conclusively on and be bound by any determination by the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as applicable, that a P&I Advance, if made, would be a Nonrecoverable P&I Advance and (ii) the Master Servicer will be entitled to rely conclusively on and be bound by any determination of the Special Servicer that a P&I Advance, if made, would be a Nonrecoverable P&I Advance.  The Trustee, in determining whether or not a P&I Advance previously made is, or a proposed P&I Advance, if made, would be, a Nonrecoverable P&I Advance shall be subject to the standards applicable to the Master Servicer hereunder.  The Special Servicer shall promptly furnish the Master Servicer and the Trustee with any information in its possession regarding the Specially Serviced Loans and REO Properties as each such party may reasonably request for purposes of making recoverability determinations.



 (d)           In connection with the recovery of any P&I Advance out of the Collection Account pursuant to Section 3.06(a) of this Agreement or any Serviced Loan Combination Collection Account pursuant to Section 3.06(b) of this Agreement, the Master Servicer shall be entitled to pay itself or the Trustee, as the case may be (in reverse of such order with respect to any Mortgage Loan or REO Property) out of any amounts then on deposit in the Collection Account or the applicable Serviced Loan Combination Collection Account (subject to the provisions of Section 3.06) (to the extent amounts therein relate to the Mortgage Loans, taking into account the related Intercreditor Agreement), interest at the Advance Rate in effect from time to time, accrued on the amount of such P&I Advance from the date made to but not including the date of reimbursement with respect to the Mortgage Loan that the Master Servicer is servicing.  The Master Servicer shall reimburse itself or the Trustee, as the case may be, for any outstanding P&I Advance as soon as practicably possible after funds available for such purpose are deposited in the Collection Account or the applicable Serviced Loan Combination Collection Account with respect to the Mortgage Loan that the Master Servicer is servicing.



 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 4.06 of this Agreement, (i) neither the Master Servicer nor the Trustee shall make an advance for Excess Interest, Yield Maintenance Charges or Penalty Charges and (ii) if the Master Servicer receives notice of an Appraisal Reduction Event and the related Appraisal Reduction Amount, the interest portion of any P&I Advance with respect to a Mortgage Loan (other than a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan) as to which there has been an Appraisal Reduction Amount will be an amount equal to the product of (x) the amount required to be advanced without giving effect to the Appraisal Reduction Amount and (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the Stated Principal Balance of such Mortgage Loan as of the immediately preceding Determination Date less any Appraisal Reduction Amount applicable to such Mortgage Loan and the denominator of which is the Stated Principal Balance of such Mortgage Loan as of such Determination Date.  All P&I Advances for any Mortgage Loans that have been modified shall be calculated on the basis of their terms as modified.  With respect to any Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan, if the Master Servicer or the Trustee, as applicable, does not receive notice of an Appraisal Reduction Event and the related Appraisal Reduction Amount from the related Other Servicer, then the Master Servicer or the Trustee, as applicable, shall have no obligation to proportionately reduce the interest portion of any P&I Advance required to be made by the Master Servicer or the Trustee, as applicable.







 The portion of any Insurance Proceeds and Net Liquidation Proceeds in respect of a Mortgage Loan or any REO Loan allocable to principal shall equal the total amount of such proceeds minus (i) any portion thereof payable to the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Operating Advisor, the Certificate Administrator or the Trustee pursuant to this Agreement and (ii) a portion thereof equal to the interest component of the Monthly Payment(s), as accrued at the related Net Mortgage Pass-Through Rate from the date as to which interest was last paid by the Borrower up to but not including the Due Date in the Collection Period in which such proceeds are received; provided, if the interest portion(s) of one or more P&I Advances with respect of such Mortgage Loan or REO Loan, as applicable, were reduced as a result of an Appraisal Reduction Event, the amount of the Net Liquidation Proceeds to be applied to interest shall be reduced by the aggregate amount of such reductions and the portion of such Net Liquidation Proceeds to be applied to principal shall be increased by such amount, and if the amount of the Net Liquidation Proceeds to be applied to principal has been applied to pay the principal of such Mortgage Loan or REO Loan in full, any remaining Net Liquidation Proceeds shall then be applied to pay any remaining accrued and unpaid interest of such Mortgage Loan or REO Loan.



 (e)           With respect to any Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan, the Master Servicer will be permitted to make its determination that it has made a P&I Advance on such Mortgage Loan that is a Nonrecoverable P&I Advance or that any proposed P&I Advance, if made, would constitute a Nonrecoverable P&I Advance with respect to such Mortgage Loan in accordance with Section 4.07(a) independently of any determination made by the Other Servicer (or any master servicer with respect to a commercial mortgage securitization holding another Non-Serviced Companion Loan related to such Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan, if any) under the Other Pooling and Servicing Agreement (or any pooling and servicing agreement with respect to a commercial mortgage securitization holding another Non-Serviced Companion Loan related to such Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan, if any).  If the Master Servicer or Trustee, as applicable, determines that a proposed P&I Advance with respect to any Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan, if made, or any outstanding P&I Advance with respect to any Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan previously made, would be, or is, as applicable, a Nonrecoverable Advance, the Master Servicer or Trustee, as applicable, shall provide the Other Servicer (and any master servicer with respect to a commercial mortgage securitization holding another Non-Serviced Companion Loan related to such Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan, if any), the Other Special Servicer and Other Trustee with written notice of such determination, promptly and in any event within two (2) Business Days after such determination or such longer time period permitted by the applicable Intercreditor Agreement.  If the Master Servicer receives written notice from an Other Servicer (or any master servicer with respect to a commercial mortgage securitization holding another Non-Serviced Companion Loan related to such Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan, if any) that it has determined, with respect to the related Non-Serviced Companion Loan, that any proposed advance of principal and/or interest with respect to the related Non-Serviced Companion Loan would be, or any outstanding advance of principal and interest is, a nonrecoverable advance of principal and/or interest, such determination shall not be binding on the Certificateholders, the Master Servicer or the Trustee; provided that, with respect to each Non-Serviced Loan Combination, each of the Master Servicer and the Trustee shall be entitled to conclusively rely on any such nonrecoverability determination.







 If the Master Servicer receives notice from a Rating Agency that it is no longer approved as a master servicer for commercial mortgage securitizations, it shall promptly notify the Trustee, any Other Trustee, any Other Servicer and any other trustee or master servicer with respect to each commercial mortgage securitization that holds a Non-Serviced Companion Loan related to a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan, if any.



 (f)           With respect to any Serviced Loan Combination that has a Serviced Companion Loan, the Master Servicer will be permitted to make its determination that it has made a P&I Advance on the related Mortgage Loan that is a Nonrecoverable P&I Advance or that any proposed P&I Advance, if made, would constitute a Nonrecoverable P&I Advance with respect to such Mortgage Loan in accordance with Section 4.07(a) independently of any determination made in respect of the related Serviced Companion Loan, by the master servicer under the related Other Pooling and Servicing Agreement.  If the Master Servicer or Trustee, as applicable, determines that a proposed P&I Advance with respect to such Serviced Loan Combination, if made, or any outstanding P&I Advance with respect to any such Mortgage Loan previously made, would be, or is, as applicable, a Nonrecoverable Advance or if the Master Servicer or Trustee, as applicable, subsequently determines that a proposed Property Advance would be a Nonrecoverable Advance or an outstanding Property Advance is or would be a Nonrecoverable Advance, the Master Servicer or Trustee, as applicable, shall provide the Other Servicer, Other Special Servicer and the Other Trustee under each related Other Pooling and Servicing Agreement with written notice of such determination, promptly and in any event within two (2) Business Days after such determination or such longer time period permitted by the applicable Intercreditor Agreement.  If the Master Servicer receives written notice from any master servicer under any such Other Pooling and Servicing Agreement that such master servicer has determined, with respect to the related Serviced Companion Loan, that any proposed advance of principal and/or interest with respect to such Serviced Companion Loan would be, or any outstanding advance of principal and interest is, a nonrecoverable advance of principal and/or interest, such determination shall not be binding on the Certificateholders, the Master Servicer or the Trustee; provided that, with respect to each Non-Serviced Loan Combination, each of the Master Servicer and the Trustee shall be entitled to conclusively rely on any such nonrecoverability determination.



 If the applicable Master Servicer receives notice from a Rating Agency that it is no longer approved as a master servicer for commercial mortgage securitizations, it shall promptly notify the Trustee, any Other Trustee, any Other Servicer and any other trustee or master servicer with respect to each commercial mortgage securitization that holds a Serviced Companion Loan related to any Serviced Loan Combination, if any.



 (g)           The Master Servicer or the Trustee, as applicable, shall be entitled to the reimbursement of P&I Advances it makes to the extent permitted pursuant to Section 3.06 of this Agreement together with any related Advance Interest Amount in respect of such P&I Advances to the extent permitted pursuant to Section 3.06 of this Agreement and the Master Servicer and the Special Servicer each hereby covenants and agrees to promptly seek and effect the reimbursement of such Advances from the related Borrowers to the extent permitted by applicable law and the related Mortgage Loan and this Agreement.



 Section 4.08       Appraisal Reductions.  (a)  For purposes of (x) determining the Controlling Class (and whether a Control Termination Event has occurred and is continuing) and







 (y) determining the Voting Rights of the related Classes for purposes of removal of the Special Servicer, Appraisal Reduction Amounts allocated to the Mortgage Loans will be allocated to each Class of Sequential Pay Certificates (other than the Class A-M, Class B and Class C Certificates) and the Class EC Regular Interests in reverse sequential order to notionally reduce the related Certificate Balances until the Certificate Balance of each such Class of Certificates or Regular Interests is reduced to zero (ixxPDexxPD, first, to the Class G Certificates, second, to the Class F Certificates, third, to the Class E Certificates, fourth, to the Class D Certificates, fifth, to the Class C Regular Interest (and correspondingly, the Class C Certificates and the Class PEZ Component C, pro rata based on their respective percentage interests therein),  sixth, to the Class B Interest (and correspondingly, the Class B Certificates and the Class PEZ Component B, pro rata based on their respective percentage interests therein),  seventh, to the Class A-M Regular Interest (and correspondingly, the Class A-M Certificates and the Class PEZ Component A-M, pro rata based on their respective percentage interests therein), and eighth, to the Class A-1, Class A-2, Class A-3 and Class A-4 Certificates, pro rata, based on their Certificate Balances).



 The Master Servicer shall notify the Certificate Administrator of the amount of any Appraisal Reduction Amount allocated to each Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination.  Based on information in its possession, the Certificate Administrator shall determine from time to time which Class of Certificates is the Controlling Class.  Promptly upon its determination of a change in the Controlling Class, the Certificate Administrator shall notify the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer and the Operating Advisor of such event, including the identity and contact information of the new Controlling Class Certificateholder (the cost of obtaining such information from the Depository being an expense of the Trust).



 (b)           The Holders of the majority (by Certificate Balance) of any Class of Control Eligible Certificates whose aggregate Certificate Balance, as notionally reduced by Appraisal Reduction Amounts allocated thereto, is less than 25% of the initial Certificate Principal Balance of such Class (such Class, an "Appraised-Out Class") as a result of an allocation of an Appraisal Reduction Amount in respect of such Class shall have the right, at their sole expense, to require the Special Servicer to order a second Appraisal of any Mortgage Loan for which an Appraisal Reduction Event has occurred (such Holders, the "Requesting Holders"), and use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain an Appraisal prepared on an "as-is" basis by an MAI appraiser reasonably acceptable to the Special Servicer within 60 days from receipt of the Requesting Holders' written request.  Any Appraised-Out Class for which the Requesting Holders are challenging the Appraisal Reduction Amount determination shall not exercise any rights of the Controlling Class until such time, if any, as such Class is reinstated as the Controlling Class and the rights of the Controlling Class will be exercised by the most senior Control Eligible Certificates, if any, during such period.



 In addition, the Requesting Holders of any Appraised-Out Class shall have the right, at their sole expense, to require the Special Servicer to order an additional appraisal of any Mortgage Loan for which an Appraisal Reduction Event has occurred if an event has occurred at or with regard to the related Mortgaged Property or Mortgaged Properties that would have a material effect on its Appraised Value, and the Special Servicer shall use reasonable efforts to obtain an Appraisal prepared on an "as-is" basis by an MAI appraiser reasonably acceptable to the Special Servicer within 60 days from receipt of the Requesting Holders' written request;







 provided that the Special Servicer shall not be required to obtain such appraisal if it determines in accordance with the Servicing Standard that no events at or with regard to the related Mortgaged Property or Mortgaged Properties have occurred that would have a material effect on the Appraised Value of the related Mortgaged Property or Mortgaged Properties.  The right of the holders of an Appraised-Out Class to require the Special Servicer to order an additional appraisal as described in this paragraph shall be limited to no more frequently than once in any 9-month period with respect to any Mortgage Loan.



 Upon receipt of any such second Appraisal, the Special Servicer shall determine, in accordance with the Servicing Standard, whether, based on its assessment of such second Appraisal, any recalculation of the Appraisal Reduction Amount is warranted and, if so warranted shall direct the Master Servicer to, and the Master Servicer shall, recalculate such Appraisal Reduction Amount based upon such second Appraisal.  If required by any such recalculation, the Appraised-Out Class shall be reinstated as the Controlling Class.



 Appraisals that are permitted to be obtained by the Special Servicer at the request of holders of an Appraised-Out Class shall be in addition to any appraisals that the Special Servicer may otherwise be required to obtain in accordance with the Servicing Standard or this Agreement without regard to any appraisal requests made by any holder of an Appraised-Out Class.



 (c)           An appraisal for any Mortgage Loan that has not been brought current for at least three consecutive months (or paid in full, liquidated, repurchased or otherwise disposed of) will be updated every 9 months for so long as an Appraisal Reduction Event exists.



 (d)           Notwithstanding the foregoing, within 60 days after an Appraisal Reduction Event (or in the case of an Appraisal Reduction Event occurring by reason of clause (ii) of the definition thereof, within 30 days of such Appraisal Reduction Event) (i) with respect to Mortgage Loans (other than Non-Serviced Mortgage Loans) or applicable Serviced Loan Combinations having a Stated Principal Balance of $2,000,000 or higher, the Special Servicer shall order and use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain an Updated Appraisal or (ii) with respect to Mortgage Loans (other than Non-Serviced Mortgage Loans) or applicable Serviced Loan Combinations having a Stated Principal Balance of less than $2,000,000, the Special Servicer, at its option, shall (A) provide a Small Loan Appraisal Estimate within the same time period as an Appraisal would otherwise be required and such Small Loan Appraisal Estimate shall be used in lieu of an Updated Appraisal to calculate the Appraisal Reduction Amount for such Mortgage Loans or applicable Serviced Loan Combinations; or (B) order and use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain an Updated Appraisal.



 (e)           On the first Distribution Date occurring at least two (2) Business Days after the delivery of an Updated Appraisal or completion of a Small Loan Appraisal Estimate, as applicable, the Master Servicer shall adjust the Appraisal Reduction Amount to take into account such Updated Appraisal or Small Loan Appraisal Estimate, as applicable, obtained from the Special Servicer.  Each Appraisal Reduction Amount shall also be adjusted to take into account any subsequent Small Loan Appraisal Estimate or Updated Appraisal, as applicable, and any letter updates, as of the date of each such subsequent Small Loan Appraisal Estimate, Updated Appraisal or letter update, as applicable.







 Section 4.09         Grantor Trust Reporting.  (a)  The Certificate Administrator shall maintain adequate books and records to account for the separate entitlements of the Grantor Trust.



 (b)           The parties intend that the Grantor Trust shall be treated as a "grantor trust" under the Code, and the provisions thereof shall be interpreted consistently with this intention.  In furtherance of such intention, none of the Depositor, the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Trustee or the Certificate Administrator shall vary the assets of the Grantor Trust so as to take advantage of market fluctuations or so as to improve the rate of return of the Exchangeable Certificates or Class V Certificates, and shall otherwise comply with Treasury Regulations Section 301.7701-4(c).  The Certificate Administrator shall file or cause to be filed with the IRS Form 1041, Form 1099 or such other form as may be applicable and shall furnish or cause to be furnished to the Holders of (i) the Class V Certificates their allocable share of income and expense with respect to the Class V Specific Grantor Trust Assets and proceeds thereof, as such amounts are received or accrue, as applicable, and (ii) the Classes of Exchangeable Certificates their allocable share of income and expense with respect to the Class A-M Specific Grantor Trust Assets, the Class B Specific Grantor Trust Assets, the Class C Specific Grantor Trust Assets and the Class PEZ Specific Grantor Trust Assets and proceeds thereof, respectively.



 (c)           (i) The Grantor Trust is a WHFIT that is a NMWHFIT.  The Certificate Administrator shall report as required under the WHFIT Regulations to the extent such information as is reasonably necessary to enable the Certificate Administrator to do so is provided to the Certificate Administrator on a timely basis.  With respect to each Class of Exchangeable Certificates and the Class V Certificates, the Certificate Administrator is hereby directed to assume that DTC is the only "middleman" as defined by the WHFIT Regulations unless it has actual knowledge to the contrary or the Depositor provides the Certificate Administrator with the identities of the other "middlemen" that are Certificateholders.  The Certificate Administrator will not be liable for any tax reporting penalties that may arise under the WHFIT Regulations in the event that the IRS makes a determination that is contrary to the first sentence of this paragraph.



 (ii)         The Certificate Administrator, in its discretion, shall report required WHFIT information using either the cash or accrual method, except to the extent the WHFIT Regulations specifically require a different method.  The Certificate Administrator shall be under no obligation to determine whether any Certificateholder uses the cash or accrual method.  The Certificate Administrator shall make available (via the Certificate Administrator's Website) WHFIT information to Certificateholders annually.  In addition, the Certificate Administrator shall not be responsible or liable for providing subsequently amended, revised or updated information to any Certificateholder, unless requested by the Certificateholder.



 (iii)         The Certificate Administrator shall not be liable for failure to meet the reporting requirements of the WHFIT Regulations nor for any penalties thereunder if such failure is due to:  (i) the lack of reasonably necessary information being provided to the Certificate Administrator or (ii) incomplete, inaccurate or untimely information being provided to the Certificate Administrator.  Each owner of a class of securities representing, in whole or in part, beneficial ownership of an interest in a WHFIT, by acceptance of its interest in such class of securities, will be deemed to have agreed to







 provide the Certificate Administrator with information regarding any sale of such securities, including the price, amount of proceeds and date of sale.  Absent receipt of information regarding any sale of Certificates, including the price, amount of proceeds and date of sale from the beneficial owner thereof or the Depositor, the Certificate Administrator shall assume there is no secondary market trading of WHFIT interests.



 (iv)         To the extent required by the WHFIT Regulations, the Certificate Administrator shall use reasonable efforts to publish on the Certificate Administrator's Website the CUSIPs for the Certificates that represent ownership of a WHFIT.  The CUSIPs so published will represent the Rule 144A CUSIPs.  The Certificate Administrator shall make reasonable good faith efforts to keep the website accurate and updated to the extent CUSIPs have been received.  Absent the receipt of a CUSIP, the Certificate Administrator will use a reasonable identifier number in lieu of a CUSIP.  The Certificate Administrator shall not be liable for investor reporting delays that result from the receipt of inaccurate or untimely CUSIP information.

 (1) The Aggregate Denomination of all Class A-M, Class B or Class C Certificates, as applicable, represents the Certificate Balance of such Class without giving effect to any exchange.  The Aggregate Denomination of all Class PEZ Certificates is equal to the aggregate of the initial Certificate Balance of the Class A-M, Class B and Class C Certificates and represents the maximum Certificate Balance of the Class PEZ Certificates that could be issued in an exchange. The Certificate Balances of the Class A-M, Class B and Class C Certificates to be issued on the Closing Date will be reduced, in required proportions, by an amount equal to the Certificate Balance of the Class PEZ Certificates issued on the Closing Date.



 (2)  The Class PEZ Certificates do not have a minimum Denomination.  However, in connection with an exchange of Class A-M, Class B and Class C Certificates for Class PEZ Certificates and vice versa, each of the Class A-M, Class B and Class C Certificates exchanged (whether surrendered or received) in such exchange shall be in denominations no smaller than the minimum Denominations set forth in this table.



 Each Certificate will share ratably in all rights of the related Class.



 The Class V, Class R and Class LR Certificates will each be issuable in one or more Individual Certificates in minimum denominations of 5% Percentage Interests and integral multiples of a 1% Percentage Interest in excess thereof and together aggregating the entire 100% Percentage Interest in each such Class.



 The Global Certificates shall be issued as one or more certificates registered in the name of a nominee designated by the Depository, and Beneficial Owners shall hold interests in the Global Certificates through the book-entry facilities of the Depository in the minimum Denominations and aggregate Denominations and Classes as set forth above.



 The Global Certificates shall in all respects be entitled to the same benefits under this Agreement as Individual Certificates authenticated and delivered hereunder.



 (b)           Except insofar as pertains to any Individual Certificate, the Trust Fund, the Certificate Administrator, the Paying Agent and the Trustee may for all purposes (including the making of payments due on the Global Certificates and the giving of notice to Holders thereof)







 deal with the Depository as the authorized representative of the Beneficial Owners with respect to the Global Certificates for the purposes of exercising the rights of Certificateholders hereunder; provided, that, for purposes of transmitting communications pursuant to Section 5.05(a) of this Agreement, to the extent that the Depositor has provided the Certificate Administrator with the names of Beneficial Owners (even if such Certificateholders hold their Certificates through the Depository) the Certificate Administrator shall provide such information to such Beneficial Owners directly.  The rights of Beneficial Owners with respect to Global Certificates shall be limited to those established by law and agreements between such Certificateholders and the Depository and Depository Participants.  Except as set forth in Section 5.01(e) below, Beneficial Owners of Global Certificates shall not be entitled to physical certificates for the Global Certificates as to which they are the Beneficial Owners.  Requests and directions from, and votes of, the Depository as Holder of the Global Certificates shall not be deemed inconsistent if they are made with respect to different Beneficial Owners.  Subject to the restrictions on transfer set forth in this Section 5.01 of this Agreement and Applicable Procedures, the holder of a beneficial interest in a Private Global Certificate may request that the Certificate Administrator cause the Depository (or any Agent Member) to notify the Certificate Registrar and the Certificate Custodian in writing of a request for transfer or exchange of such beneficial interest for an Individual Certificate or Certificates.  Upon receipt of such a request and payment by the related Beneficial Owner of any attendant expenses, the Certificate Administrator shall cause the issuance and delivery of such Individual Certificates.  The Certificate Registrar may establish a reasonable record date in connection with solicitations of consents from or voting by Certificateholders and give notice to the Depository of such record date.  Without the written consent of the Certificate Registrar, no Global Certificate may be transferred by the Depository except to a successor Depository that agrees to hold the Global Certificates for the account of the Beneficial Owners.



 (c)           Any of the Certificates may be issued with appropriate insertions, omissions, substitutions and variations, and may have imprinted or otherwise reproduced thereon such legend or legends, not inconsistent with the provisions of this Agreement, as may be required to comply with any law or with rules or regulations pursuant thereto, or with the rules of any securities market in which the Certificates are admitted to trading, or to conform to general usage.



 (d)           The Global Certificates (i) shall be delivered by the Certificate Registrar to the Depository or, pursuant to the Depository's instructions on behalf of the Depository to, and deposited with, the Certificate Custodian, and in either case shall be registered in the name of Cede & Co. and (ii) shall bear a legend substantially to the following effect:



 "Unless this certificate is presented by an authorized representative of The Depository Trust Company, a New York corporation ("DTC"), to the Certificate Registrar for registration of transfer, exchange or payment, and any certificate issued is registered in the name of Cede & Co. or in such other name as is requested by an authorized representative of DTC (and any payment is made to Cede & Co. or to such other entity as is requested by an authorized representative of DTC), ANY TRANSFER, PLEDGE OR OTHER USE HEREOF FOR VALUE OR OTHERWISE BY OR TO ANY







 PERSON IS WRONGFUL inasmuch as the registered owner hereof, Cede & Co., has an interest herein."



 The Global Certificates may be deposited with such other Depository as the Certificate Registrar may from time to time designate, and shall bear such legend as may be appropriate.



 (e)           If (i) the Depository advises the Certificate Administrator in writing that the Depository is no longer willing or able properly to discharge its responsibilities as Depository, and the Depositor is unable to locate a qualified successor or (ii) the Depositor, at its sole option, elects in writing to the Certificate Administrator and to the Depository to terminate the book-entry system through the Depository with respect to all or any portion of any Class of Certificates, the Certificate Administrator shall notify the affected Beneficial Owner or Owners through the Depository of the occurrence of such event and the availability of Individual Certificates to such Beneficial Owners requesting them.  Upon surrender to the Certificate Administrator of Global Certificates by the Depository, accompanied by registration instructions from the Depository for registration of transfer, the Certificate Administrator shall issue the Individual Certificates.  Neither the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator, the Certificate Registrar, the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer nor the Depositor shall be liable for any actions taken by the Depository or its nominee, including, without limitation, any delay in delivery of such instructions.  Upon the issuance of Individual Certificates, the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator, the Certificate Registrar and the Master Servicer shall recognize the Holders of Individual Certificates as Certificateholders hereunder.



 (f)           If the Trustee, its agents, the Certificate Administrator, its agents or the Master Servicer or Special Servicer have instituted or have been directed to institute any judicial proceeding in a court to enforce the rights of the Certificateholders under the Certificates, and the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator, the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer have been advised by counsel that in connection with such proceeding it is necessary or appropriate for the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator, the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer to obtain possession of the Certificates, the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator, the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer may in their sole discretion determine that the Certificates represented by the Global Certificates shall no longer be represented by such Global Certificates.  In such event, the Certificate Administrator or the Authenticating Agent will execute and authenticate and the Certificate Registrar will deliver, in exchange for such Global Certificates, Individual Certificates (and if the Certificate Administrator or the Certificate Custodian has in its possession Individual Certificates previously executed, the Authenticating Agent will authenticate and the Certificate Registrar will deliver such Certificates) in a Denomination equal to the aggregate Denomination of such Global Certificates.



 (g)           If the Trust Fund ceases to be subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, the Certificate Administrator shall make available to each Holder and Beneficial Owner of a Class of Certificates, upon request of such a Holder, information, to the extent such information is in its possession, substantially equivalent in scope to the information currently filed by the Certificate Administrator with the Commission pursuant to the Exchange Act, plus additional information required to be provided for securities qualifying for resales under Rule 144A under the Act.







 For so long as the Class V, Class R or Class LR Certificates remain outstanding, none of the Depositor, the Trustee or the Certificate Registrar shall take any action which would cause the Trust Fund to fail to be subject to Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act.



 (h)           Each Certificate may be printed or in typewritten or similar form, and each Certificate shall, upon original issue, be executed and authenticated by the Certificate Administrator or the Authenticating Agent and delivered to, or at the order of, the Depositor.  All Certificates shall be executed by manual or facsimile signature on behalf of the Certificate Administrator or Authenticating Agent by an authorized officer or signatory.  Certificates bearing the signature of an individual who was at any time the proper officer or signatory of the Certificate Administrator or Authenticating Agent shall bind the Certificate Administrator or Authenticating Agent, notwithstanding that such individual has ceased to hold such office or position prior to the delivery of such Certificates or did not hold such office or position at the date of such Certificates.  No Certificate shall be entitled to any benefit under this Agreement, or be valid for any purpose, unless there appears on such Certificate a certificate of authentication in the form set forth in Exhibits A-1 through A-19 executed by the Authenticating Agent by manual signature, and such certificate of authentication upon any Certificate shall be conclusive evidence, and the only evidence, that such Certificate has been duly authenticated and delivered hereunder.  All Certificates shall be dated the date of their authentication.



 (i)           If, in connection with any Distribution Date, the Certificate Administrator shall have reported the amount of an anticipated distribution to the Depository based on the expected receipt of any monthly payment based on information set forth in any report of the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, or any other monthly payment, Balloon Payment or prepayment expected to be paid on the last two Business Days preceding such Distribution Date, and the related Borrower fails to make such payments at such time, the Certificate Administrator shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Depository to make the revised distribution on a timely basis on such Distribution Date.  Any out-of-pocket costs incurred by the Certificate Administrator as a consequence of a Borrower failing to make such payments shall be reimbursable to the Certificate Administrator as an expense of the Trust Fund.



 Section 5.02     Registration, Transfer and Exchange of Certificates.  (a)  The Certificate Administrator shall keep or cause to be kept at its offices books (the "Certificate Register") for the registration, transfer and exchange of Certificates (the Certificate Administrator, in such capacity, being the "Certificate Registrar").  The Depositor, the Trustee, the Master Servicer and the Special Servicer shall have the right to inspect the Certificate Register or to obtain a copy thereof at all reasonable times, and to rely conclusively upon a certificate of the Certificate Registrar as to the information set forth in the Certificate Register.  The names and addresses of all Certificateholders and the names and addresses of the transferees of any Certificates shall be registered in the Certificate Register; provided, in no event shall the Certificate Registrar be required to maintain in the Certificate Register the names of the individual Participants holding beneficial interests in the Trust Fund through the Depository.  The Person in whose name any Certificate is so registered shall be deemed and treated as the sole owner and Holder thereof for all purposes of this Agreement and the Depositor, Certificate Registrar, the Master Servicer, Special Servicer, the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator, any Paying Agent and any agent of any of them shall not be affected by any notice or knowledge to the contrary.  An Individual Certificate is transferable or exchangeable only upon the surrender







 of such Certificate to the Certificate Registrar at its offices together with an assignment and transfer (executed by the Holder or his duly authorized attorney), subject to the requirements of Section 5.01(h) and Sections 5.02(c), (d), (e), (f), (g), (h) and (i) of this Agreement.  Upon request of the Certificate Administrator, the Certificate Registrar shall provide the Certificate Administrator with the names, addresses and Percentage Interests of the Holders.



 (b)           Upon surrender for registration of transfer of any Individual Certificate, subject to the requirements of Sections 5.02(c), (d), (e), (f), (g), (h) and (i) of this Agreement, the Certificate Administrator shall execute and the Authenticating Agent shall duly authenticate in the name of the designated transferee or transferees, one or more new Certificates in Denominations of a like aggregate Denomination as the Individual Certificate being surrendered.  Such Certificates shall be delivered by the Certificate Registrar in accordance with Section 5.02(e) of this Agreement.  Each Certificate surrendered for registration of transfer shall be canceled and subsequently destroyed by the Certificate Registrar.  Each new Certificate issued pursuant to this Section 5.02 shall be registered in the name of any Person as the transferring Holder may request, subject to the provisions of Sections 5.01(h) and 5.02(c), (d), (e), (f), (g), (h) and (i) of this Agreement.



 (c)           In addition to the provisions of Sections 5.01(h) and 5.02(d), (e), (f), (g), (h) and (i) of this Agreement and the rules of the Depository, the exchange, transfer and registration of transfer of Private Certificates that are Individual Certificates or beneficial interests in the Private Global Certificates shall be subject to the following restrictions:

 (A)           Other than the initial transfer from the Initial Purchasers to an initial investor, the Certificate Registrar shall register the transfer of such Individual Certificate if the requested transfer is being made by a transferee who has provided the Certificate Registrar with an Investment Representation Letter substantially in the form of Exhibit D-1 to this Agreement (an "Investment Representation Letter"), to the effect that the transfer is being made to a Qualified Institutional Buyer in accordance with Rule 144A;



 (B)           The Certificate Registrar shall register the transfer of such Individual Certificate pursuant to Regulation S after the expiration of the Restricted Period if (1) the transferor has provided the Certificate Registrar with a Regulation S Transfer Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit G to this Agreement (a "Regulation S Transfer Certificate"), and (2) the transferee furnishes to the Certificate Registrar an Investment Representation Letter; or



 (C)           The Certificate Registrar shall register the transfer of such Individual Certificate if prior to the transfer such transferee furnishes to the Certificate Registrar (1) an Investment Representation Letter to the effect that the transfer is being made to an Institutional Accredited Investor or to an Affiliated Person in accordance with an applicable exemption under the Act and (2) in the







 case of a transfer to an Affiliated Person, an opinion of counsel acceptable to the Certificate Registrar that such transfer is in compliance with the Act;



 and, in each case, the Certificate Registrar shall register the transfer of such Individual Certificate only if prior to the transfer the transferee furnishes to the Certificate Registrar a written undertaking by the transferor to reimburse the Trust Fund for any costs incurred by it in connection with the proposed transfer.  In addition, the Certificate Registrar may, as a condition of the registration of any such transfer, require the transferor to furnish such other certificates, legal opinions or other information (at the transferor's expense) as the Certificate Registrar may reasonably require to confirm that the proposed transfer is being made pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to the registration requirements of the Act and other applicable laws.



 (ii)       Transfers within the Private Global Certificates.  Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary herein, so long as a Private Global Certificate remains outstanding and is held by or on behalf of the Depository, transfers within such Global Certificate shall only be made in accordance with this Section 5.02(c)(ii).

If, after the Restricted Period, a Beneficial Owner of an interest in a Rule 144A Global Certificate wishes at any time to transfer its beneficial interest in such Rule 144A Global Certificate to a Person who wishes to take delivery thereof in the form of a beneficial interest in the related Regulation S Global Certificate, such holder may, in addition to complying with all Applicable Procedures, transfer or cause the transfer of such beneficial interest for an equivalent beneficial interest in such Regulation S Global Certificate only upon compliance with the provisions of this Section 5.02(c)(ii)(B).  Upon receipt by the Certificate Registrar at the Corporate Trust Office of (1) written instructions given in accordance with the Applicable Procedures from an Agent Member directing the Certificate Registrar to credit or cause to be credited to another specified Agent Member's account a beneficial interest in the Regulation S Global Certificate in an amount equal to the Denomination of the beneficial interest in the Rule 144A Global Certificate to be transferred, (2) a written order given in accordance with the Applicable Procedures containing information regarding the account of the Agent Member and, in the case of a transfer pursuant to and in accordance with Regulation S, the Euroclear or Clearstream account, as the case may be, to be credited with, and the account of the Agent Member to be debited for, such beneficial interest, and (3) a certificate in the form of Exhibit I to this Agreement given by the Beneficial Owner of such interest, the Certificate Registrar shall instruct the Depository or the Certificate Custodian, as applicable, to reduce the Denomination of the Rule 144A Global Certificate by the aggregate Denomination of the beneficial interest in the Rule 144A Global Certificate to be so transferred and, concurrently with such reduction, to increase the Denomination of the Regulation S Global Certificate by the aggregate Denomination of the beneficial interest in the Rule 144A Global Certificate to be so transferred, and to credit or cause to be credited to the account of the Person specified in such instructions a beneficial interest in the Regulation S Global Certificate having a Denomination equal to the amount by which the Denomination of the Rule 144A Global Certificate was reduced upon such transfer.

No such transfer shall be made and the Certificate Registrar shall not register any such transfer unless such transfer is made in accordance with this Section 5.02(c)(iii).



 (A)           Transfers of a beneficial interest in a Private Global Certificate to an Institutional Accredited Investor will require delivery in the form of an Individual Certificate and the Certificate Registrar shall register such transfer only upon compliance with the provisions of Section 5.02(c)(i)(C) of this Agreement.



 (B)           Transfers of a beneficial interest in a Private Global Certificate to a Qualified Institutional Buyer or a Regulation S Investor wishing to take delivery in the form of an Individual Certificate will be registered by the Certificate







 Registrar only upon compliance with the provisions of Section 5.02(c)(i)(A) or (B) of this Agreement, respectively.

Unless determined otherwise by the Certificate Registrar and the Depositor in accordance with applicable law, an Individual Certificate issued upon transfer of or exchange for a beneficial interest in the Private Global Certificate shall bear the Securities Legend.



 (iv)       Transfers of Individual Certificates to the Private Global Certificates.  If a Holder of an Individual Certificate wishes at any time to transfer such Certificate to a Person who wishes to take delivery thereof in the form of a beneficial interest in the related Regulation S Global Certificate or the related Rule 144A Global Certificate, such transfer may be effected only in accordance with the Applicable Procedures and this Section 5.02(c)(iv).  Upon receipt by the Certificate Registrar at the Corporate Trust Office of (l) the Individual Certificate to be transferred with an assignment and transfer pursuant to Section 5.05(a) of this Agreement, (2) written instructions given in accordance with the Applicable Procedures from an Agent Member directing the Certificate Registrar to credit or cause to be credited to a specified Agent Member's account a beneficial interest in such Regulation S Global Certificate or such Rule 144A Global Certificate, as the case may be, in an amount equal to the Denomination of the Individual Certificate to be so transferred, (3) a written order given in accordance with the Applicable Procedures containing information regarding the account of the Agent Member and, in the case of any transfer pursuant to Regulation S, the Euroclear or Clearstream account, as the case may be, to be credited with such beneficial interest, and (4) (x) an Investment Representation Letter from the transferee and, if delivery is to be taken in the form of a beneficial interest in the Regulation S Global Certificate, a Regulation S Transfer Certificate from the transferor or (y) an Investment Representation Letter from the transferee to the effect that such transferee is a Qualified Institutional Buyer if delivery is to be taken in the form of a beneficial interest in the Rule 144A Global Certificate, the Certificate Registrar shall cancel such Individual Certificate, execute and deliver a new Individual Certificate for the Denomination of the Individual Certificate not so transferred, registered in the name of the Holder or the Holder's transferee (as instructed by the Holder), and the Certificate Registrar shall instruct the Depository or the Certificate Custodian, as applicable, to increase the Denomination of the Regulation S Global Certificate or the Rule 144A Global Certificate, as the case may







 be, by the Denomination of the Individual Certificate to be so transferred, and to credit or cause to be credited to the account of the Person specified in such instructions who, in the case of any increase in the Regulation S Global Certificate during the Restricted Period, shall be an Agent Member acting for or on behalf of Euroclear or Clearstream, or both, as the case may be, a corresponding Denomination of the Rule 144A Global Certificate or the Regulation S Global Certificate, as the case may be.



 It is the intent of the foregoing that under no circumstances may an Institutional Accredited Investor that is not a Qualified Institutional Buyer take delivery in the form of a beneficial interest in a Private Global Certificate, other than the initial transfer from the Initial Purchasers to an initial investor.



 (v)       All Transfers.  An exchange of a beneficial interest in a Global Certificate for an Individual Certificate or Certificates, an exchange of an Individual Certificate or Certificates for a beneficial interest in a Global Certificate and an exchange of an Individual Certificate or Certificates for another Individual Certificate or Certificates (in each case, whether or not such exchange is made in anticipation of subsequent transfer, and, in the case of the Global Certificates, so long as the Global Certificates remain outstanding and are held by or on behalf of the Depository), may be made only in accordance with this Section 5.02 and in accordance with the rules of the Depository and Applicable Procedures.



 (d)           If Certificates are issued upon the transfer, exchange or replacement of Certificates not bearing the Securities Legend, the Certificates so issued shall not bear the Securities Legend.  If Certificates are issued upon the transfer, exchange or replacement of Certificates bearing the Securities Legend, or if a request is made to remove the Securities Legend on a Certificate, the Certificates so issued shall bear the Securities Legend, or the Securities Legend shall not be removed, as the case may be, unless there is delivered to the Certificate Registrar such satisfactory evidence, which may include an opinion of counsel (at the expense of the party requesting the removal of such legend) familiar with United States securities laws, as may be reasonably required by the Certificate Registrar, that neither the Securities Legend nor the restrictions on transfers set forth therein are required to ensure that transfers of any Certificate comply with the provisions of Rule 144A or Rule 144 under the Act or that such Certificate is not a "restricted security" within the meaning of Rule 144 under the Act.  Upon provision of such satisfactory evidence, the Certificate Registrar shall execute and deliver a Certificate that does not bear the Securities Legend.



 (e)           Subject to the restrictions on transfer and exchange set forth in Section 5.01(i) and in this Section 5.02, the Holder of any Individual Certificate may transfer or exchange the same in whole or in part (with a denomination equal to any authorized denomination) by surrendering such Certificate at the office of the Certificate Administrator or at the office of any transfer agent appointed as provided under this Agreement, together with an instrument of assignment or transfer (executed by the Holder or its duly authorized attorney), in the case of transfer, and a written request for exchange, in the case of exchange.  Following a proper request for transfer or exchange, the Certificate Registrar shall, within five Business Days of such request if made at such office of the Certificate Administrator or within ten Business Days if made at the office of a transfer agent (other than the Certificate Registrar), execute and deliver at the office of the Certificate Administrator or at the office of such transfer agent, as the







 case may be, to the transferee (in the case of transfer) or Holder (in the case of exchange) or send by first-class mail (at the risk of the transferee in the case of transfer or Holder in the case of exchange) to such address as the transferee or Holder, as applicable, may request, an Individual Certificate or Certificates, as the case may require, for a like aggregate Denomination and in such Denomination or Denominations as may be requested.  The presentation for transfer or exchange of any Individual Certificate shall not be valid unless made at the office of the Certificate Administrator or at the office of a transfer agent by the registered Holder in person, or by a duly authorized attorney-in-fact.  The Certificate Registrar may decline to accept any request for an exchange or registration of transfer of any Certificate during the period of 15 days preceding any Distribution Date.



 (f)           An Individual Certificate (other than an Individual Certificate issued in exchange for a beneficial interest in a Global Certificate pursuant to Section 5.01 of this Agreement) or a beneficial interest in a Private Global Certificate may only be transferred to Eligible Investors, as described herein.  In the event that a Responsible Officer of the Certificate Registrar has actual knowledge that such an Individual Certificate or beneficial interest in a Private Global Certificate is being held by or for the benefit of a Person who is not an Eligible Investor, or that such holding is unlawful under the laws of a relevant jurisdiction, then the Certificate Registrar shall have the right to void such transfer, if permitted under applicable law, or to require the investor to sell such Individual Certificate or beneficial interest in a Private Global Certificate to an Eligible Investor within fourteen days after notice of such determination and each Certificateholder by its acceptance of a Certificate authorizes the Certificate Registrar to take such action.



 (g)           Subject to the provisions of this Section 5.02 regarding transfer and exchange, transfers of the Global Certificates shall be limited to transfers of such Global Certificates in whole, but not in part, to nominees of the Depository or to a successor of the Depository or such successor's nominee.



 (h)           No fee or service charge shall be imposed by the Certificate Registrar for its services in respect of any registration of transfer or exchange referred to in this Section 5.02 other than for transfers to Institutional Accredited Investors, as provided herein.  In connection with any transfer to an Institutional Accredited Investor, the transferor shall reimburse the Trust Fund for any costs (including the cost of the Certificate Registrar's counsel's review of the documents and any legal opinions, submitted by the transferor or transferee to the Certificate Registrar as provided herein) incurred by the Certificate Registrar in connection with such transfer.  The Certificate Registrar may require payment by each transferor of a sum sufficient to cover any tax, expense or other governmental charge payable in connection with any such transfer.



 (i)           Subject to Section 5.02(e) of this Agreement, transfers of the Class V, Class R and Class LR Certificates may be made only in accordance with this Section 5.02(i).  The Certificate Registrar shall register the transfer of a Class R or Class LR Certificate only if (x) the transferor has advised the Certificate Registrar in writing that such Certificate is being transferred to a Qualified Institutional Buyer and (y) prior to such transfer the transferee furnishes to the Certificate Registrar an Investment Representation Letter.  The Certificate Registrar shall register the transfer of a Class V Certificate only if (x) the transferor has advised the Certificate Registrar in writing that such Certificate is being transferred to a Qualified







 Institutional Buyer or an Affiliated Person or an Institutional Accredited Investor and (y) prior to such transfer the transferee furnishes to the Certificate Registrar an Investment Representation Letter.  In addition, the Certificate Registrar may as a condition of the registration of any such transfer require the transferor to furnish such other certifications, legal opinions or other information (at the transferor's expense) as it may reasonably require to confirm that the proposed transfer is being made pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Act and other applicable laws.



 (j)           No transfer, sale, pledge or other disposition of any Class of Private Certificates or interest therein shall be made unless that transfer, sale, pledge or other disposition is exempt from the registration and/or qualification requirements of the Act and any applicable state securities laws, or is otherwise made in accordance with the Act and such state securities laws.  Neither the Depositor, the Master Servicer, the Certificate Administrator, the Trustee nor the Certificate Registrar are obligated to register or qualify the Private Certificates under the Act or any other securities law or to take any action not otherwise required under this Agreement to permit the transfer of such Private Certificates without registration or qualification.  Any Certificateholder desiring to effect such a transfer shall, and does hereby agree to, indemnify the Depositor, the Master Servicer, the Certificate Administrator, the Trustee and the Certificate Registrar, against any loss, liability or expense that may result if the transfer is not so exempt or is not made in accordance with such federal and state laws.



 (k)           No transfer of any Class X-C, Class E, Class F, Class G, Class V, Class R or Class LR Certificate (each, a "Restricted Certificate") shall be made to (i) an employee benefit plan subject to the fiduciary responsibility provisions of ERISA, or Section 4975 of the Code, or a governmental plan, as defined in Section 3(32) of ERISA, subject to any federal, state or local law ("Similar Law") which is to a material extent similar to the foregoing provisions of ERISA or the Code (each, a "Plan") or (ii) a collective investment fund in which a Plan is invested, an insurance company that is using the assets of any insurance company separate account or general account in which the assets of any such Plan are invested (or which are deemed pursuant to ERISA or any Similar Law to include assets of Plans) to acquire any such Restricted Certificate or any other Person acting on behalf of any Plan or using the assets of any Plan to acquire any such Restricted Certificate, other than (with respect to transfer of Restricted Certificates other than the Class V and the Residual Certificates) an insurance company using the assets of its general account under circumstances whereby such transfer to such insurance company would be exempt from the "prohibited transaction" provisions of Sections 406 and 407 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code under Sections I and III of PTCE 95-60, or a substantially similar exemption under Similar Law.  Each prospective transferee of a Restricted Certificate shall either (A) deliver to the Depositor, the Certificate Registrar and the Certificate Administrator, a transfer or representation letter, substantially in the form of Exhibit D-2 to this Agreement, stating that the prospective transferee is not a Person referred to in (i) or (ii) above or (B) if the transferee is such an entity specified in (i) or (ii) above (except in the case of a Class V Certificate or a Residual Certificate, which may not be transferred unless the transferee represents it is not such an entity), such entity, at its own expense, shall provide any opinion of counsel, officers' certificates or agreements as may be required by, and in form and substance satisfactory to, the Depositor, the Certificate Administrator and the Certificate Registrar, to the effect that the purchase and holding of the Certificates by or on behalf of a Plan will not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction within the meaning of Sections 406 and 407 of ERISA and







 Section 4975 of the Code, and will not subject the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Operating Advisor, the Depositor, the Certificate Administrator, the Trustee or the Certificate Registrar to any obligation or liability.  None of the Certificate Administrator or the Certificate Registrar shall register a Class V, Class R or Class LR Certificate in any Person's name unless such Person has provided the letter referred to in clause (A) of the preceding sentence.  The transferee of a beneficial interest in a Global Certificate that is a Restricted Certificate shall be deemed to represent that it is not a Plan or a Person acting on behalf of any Plan or using the assets of any Plan to acquire such interest other than (with respect to transfers of beneficial interests in Global Certificates which are Restricted Certificates other than the Class V Certificates and the Residual Certificates) an insurance company using the assets of its general account under circumstances whereby such transfer to such insurance company would be exempt from the "prohibited transaction" provisions of Sections 406 and 407 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code under Sections I and III of PTCE 95-60, or a substantially similar exemption under Similar Law.  Any transfer of a Restricted Certificate that would violate or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or Similar Law shall be deemed absolutely null and void ab initio.



 (l)           Each Person who has or acquires any Ownership Interest shall be deemed by the acceptance or acquisition of such Ownership Interest to have agreed to be bound by the following provisions and the rights of each Person acquiring any Ownership Interest are expressly subject to the following provisions:



 (i)       Each Person acquiring or holding any Ownership Interest shall be a Permitted Transferee and shall not acquire or hold such Ownership Interest as agent (including a broker, nominee or other middleman) on behalf of any Person that is not a Permitted Transferee.  Any such Person shall promptly notify the Certificate Registrar of any change or impending change in its status (or the status of the beneficial owner of such Ownership Interest) as a Permitted Transferee.  Any acquisition described in the first sentence of this Section 5.02(l) by a Person who is not a Permitted Transferee or by a Person who is acting as an agent of a Person who is not a Permitted Transferee shall be void and of no effect, and the immediately preceding owner who was a Permitted Transferee shall be restored to registered and beneficial ownership of the Ownership Interest as fully as possible.



 (ii)       No Ownership Interest may be Transferred, and no such Transfer shall be registered in the Certificate Register, without the express written consent of the Certificate Registrar, and the Certificate Registrar shall not recognize the Transfer, and such proposed Transfer shall not be effective, without such consent with respect thereto.  In connection with any proposed Transfer of any Ownership Interest, the Certificate Registrar shall, as a condition to such consent, (x) require delivery to it in form and substance satisfactory to it, and the proposed transferee shall deliver to the Certificate Registrar and to the proposed transferor an affidavit in substantially the form attached as Exhibit C-1 (a "Transferee Affidavit") of the proposed transferee (A) that such proposed transferee is a Permitted Transferee and (B) stating that (i) the proposed transferee historically has paid its debts as they have come due and intends to do so in the future, (ii) the proposed transferee understands that, as the holder of an Ownership Interest, it may incur liabilities in excess of cash flows generated by the residual interest, (iii) the







 proposed transferee intends to pay taxes associated with holding the Ownership Interest as they become due, (iv) the proposed transferee will not transfer the Ownership Interest to any Person that does not provide a Transferee Affidavit or as to which the proposed transferee has actual knowledge that such Person is not a Permitted Transferee or is acting as an agent (including a broker, nominee or other middleman) for a Person that is not a Permitted Transferee, (v) the proposed transferee will not cause income from the Class R or Class LR Certificate to be attributable to a foreign permanent establishment or fixed base, within the meaning of an applicable income tax treaty, of the proposed transferee or any other UxxPDSxxPD Tax Person and (vi) the proposed transferee expressly agrees to be bound by and to abide by the provisions of this Section 5.02(l) and (y) require a statement from the proposed transferor substantially in the form attached as Exhibit C-2 (the "Transferor Letter"), that the proposed transferor has no actual knowledge that the proposed transferee is not a Permitted Transferee and has no actual knowledge or reason to know that the proposed transferee's statements in the preceding clauses (x)(B)(i) or (iii) are false.



 (iii)       Notwithstanding the delivery of a Transferee Affidavit by a proposed transferee under clause (ii) above, if a Responsible Officer of the Certificate Registrar has actual knowledge that the proposed transferee is not a Permitted Transferee, no Transfer to such proposed transferee shall be effected and such proposed Transfer shall not be registered on the Certificate Register; provided, that the Certificate Registrar shall not be required to conduct any independent investigation to determine whether a proposed transferee is a Permitted Transferee.



 Neither the Certificate Administrator nor the Certificate Registrar shall have any obligation or duty to monitor, determine or inquire as to compliance with any restriction or transfer imposed under Article V of this Agreement or under applicable law with respect to any transfer of any Certificate (including, without limitation, the Securities Legend), or any interest therein, other than to require delivery of the certification(s) and/or opinions of counsel described in Article V applicable with respect to changes in registration of record ownership of Certificates in the Certificate Register.  The Certificate Administrator and the Certificate Registrar shall have no liability for transfers, including transfers made through the book-entry facilities of the Depository or between or among Depository Participants or Beneficial Owners made in violation of applicable restrictions.



 Upon written notice to the Certificate Registrar, or upon the Certificate Registrar having actual knowledge, that there has occurred a Transfer to any Person that is a Disqualified Organization or an agent thereof (including a broker, nominee, or middleman) in contravention of the foregoing restrictions, and in any event not later than 60 days after a request for information from the transferor of such Ownership Interest, or such agent, the Certificate Registrar and the Certificate Administrator agree to furnish to the IRS and the transferor of such Ownership Interest or such agent such information necessary to the application of Section 860E(e) of the Code as may be required by the Code, including, but not limited to, the present value of the total anticipated excess inclusions with respect to such Class R or Class LR Certificate (or portion thereof) for periods after such Transfer.  At the election of the Certificate Registrar and the Certificate Administrator, the Certificate Registrar and the Certificate Administrator may charge a reasonable fee for computing and furnishing such information to the







 transferor or to such agent referred to above; provided that such Persons shall in no event be excused from furnishing such information.



 Section 5.03     Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost or Stolen Certificates.  If (i) any mutilated Certificate is surrendered to the Certificate Registrar, or the Certificate Registrar receives evidence to its satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Certificate, and (ii) there is delivered to the Certificate Registrar such security or indemnity as may be required by it to save it and the Certificate Administrator harmless, then, in the absence of actual knowledge by a Responsible Officer of the Certificate Registrar that such Certificate has been acquired by a bona fide purchaser, the Certificate Administrator or the Authenticating Agent shall execute and authenticate and the Certificate Registrar shall deliver, in exchange for or in lieu of any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Certificate, a new Certificate of the same Class and of like tenor and Percentage Interest.  Upon the issuance of any new Certificate under this Section 5.03, the Certificate Registrar may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Certificate Registrar) connected therewith.  Any replacement Certificate issued pursuant to this Section 5.03 shall constitute complete and indefeasible evidence of ownership of the corresponding interest in the Trust Fund, as if originally issued, whether or not the lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate shall be found at any time.

The initial Paying Agent shall be the Certificate Administrator.  Except for the Certificate Administrator, as the initial Paying Agent, the Paying Agent shall at all times be an entity having a long-term unsecured debt rating of at least  "A" from Fitch and "A2" by Moody's, or shall be otherwise acceptable to each Rating Agency, as confirmed by a receipt of a No Downgrade Confirmation.

The assets of the Grantor Trust held for the benefit of the Holders of the Exchangeable Certificates shall consist of the Class EC Regular Interests, which have been placed in the Grantor Trust through the efforts of the Underwriters.  The Class EC Regular Interests shall be held by the

No exchange of Exchangeable Certificates may occur pursuant to this Section 5.08 after the date when the then-current Certificate Balance of the Class A-M Regular Interest (and, correspondingly, the Class A-M Certificates and, to the extent evidencing an interest in the Class A-M Regular Interest, the Class PEZ Certificates)  has been reduced to zero as a result of the payment in full of all interest and principal thereon.  There shall be no limitation on the number of exchanges of Exchangeable Certificates authorized pursuant to this Section 5.08.  In addition, the Depositor shall have the right to make or cause exchanges on the Closing Date pursuant to instructions delivered to the Certificate Administrator on the Closing Date.

The Certificate Administrator shall make the first distribution on an Exchangeable Certificate received by a Certificateholder in any exchange on the Distribution Date in the month following the month of exchange to the Certificateholder of record as of the applicable Record Date for such Certificate and Distribution Date. If an Exchange Date occurs in any month before the Distribution Date in such month, then any distributions to be made on such Distribution Date on any Certificates surrendered in the exchange shall be so made to the Certificateholder of record as of the applicable Record Date for such Certificates and such Distribution Date.  Neither the Certificate Administrator nor the Depositor shall have any obligation to ensure the availability of the applicable Certificates in the market to accomplish any exchange.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Master Servicer, Special Servicer or Operating Advisor may remain the Master Servicer, Special Servicer or Operating Advisor, as applicable, under this Agreement after (x) being merged or consolidated with or into any Person that is a Prohibited Party, or (y) transferring all or substantially all of its assets to any Person if such Person is a Prohibited Party, except to the extent (i) the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer or Operating Advisor, as applicable, is the surviving entity of such merger, consolidation or transfer and has been and continues to be in compliance with its Regulation AB reporting obligations hereunder or (ii) the Depositor consents to such merger, consolidation or transfer, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

 (b)           None of the Depositor, the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer or the Operating Advisor shall be under any obligation to appear in, prosecute or defend any legal action, unless such action relates to its respective duties under this Agreement and which in its opinion does not expose it to any expense or liability not recoverable from the Trust Fund; provided, that each of the Depositor, the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer or the Operating Advisor may in its discretion undertake any such action that it may deem necessary or desirable in respect to this Agreement and the rights and duties of the parties hereto and the interests of the Certificateholders and holders of Serviced Companion Loan Securities, if applicable, hereunder.

 (c)           The terms of this Section 6.03 shall survive the termination of any party hereto or of this Agreement.

(a)  Each of the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer and the Operating Advisor may assign their respective rights and delegate their respective duties and obligations under this Agreement in connection with the sale or transfer of a substantial portion of their mortgage servicing, asset management or (solely with respect to the Operating Advisor) commercial mortgage surveillance, portfolio, provided that:  (i) the purchaser or transferee accepting such assignment and delegation (A) shall be an established mortgage finance institution, bank or mortgage servicing institution (or, in the case of the Operating Advisor, an Eligible Operating Advisor), organized and doing business under the laws of the United States of America, any state of the United States of America or the District of Columbia, authorized under such laws to perform the duties of the Master Servicer, Special Servicer or Operating Advisor or a Person resulting from a merger, consolidation or succession that is permitted under Section 6.02 of this Agreement, (B) shall be acceptable to each Rating Agency as confirmed in a No Downgrade Confirmation delivered to the Trustee and the Certificate Administrator relating to the Certificates and Serviced Companion Loan Securities, if any, (C) shall execute and deliver to the Trustee and the Certificate Administrator an agreement that contains an assumption by







 such Person of the due and punctual performance and observance of each covenant and condition to be performed or observed by the Master Servicer, Special Servicer or Operating Advisor, as applicable under this Agreement from and after the date of such agreement and (D) shall not be a Prohibited Party; (ii) the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer or the Operating Advisor shall not be released from its obligations under this Agreement that arose prior to the effective date of such assignment and delegation under this Section 6.04; (iii) the rate at which the Servicing Compensation, Special Servicing Compensation or Operating Advisor Fee, as applicable (or any component thereof) is calculated shall not exceed the rate then in effect and (iv) the resigning Master Servicer, Special Servicer or Operating Advisor, as applicable, shall be responsible for the reasonable costs and expenses of each other party hereto and the Rating Agencies in connection with such transfer.  Upon acceptance of such assignment and delegation, the purchaser or transferee shall be the successor Master Servicer, Special Servicer or Operating Advisor, as applicable, hereunder.



 (b)           Except as provided in Section 6.02 of this Agreement and this Section 6.04, the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer and the Operating Advisor shall not resign from its respective obligations and duties hereby imposed on it except (i) upon determination that such duties hereunder are no longer permissible under applicable law, (ii) in connection with the assignment of rights and delegation of duties as set forth in Section 6.04(a) or (iii) solely with respect to the Operating Advisor, pursuant to Section 6.04(e).

 (c)           The Trustee shall be permitted to remove the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer upon a Master Servicer Termination Event or Special Servicer Termination Event, as applicable.  Without limiting the generality of the succeeding paragraph, no such removal shall be effective unless and until (i) the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer has been paid any unpaid Servicing Compensation or Special Servicing Compensation, as applicable, unreimbursed Advances (including Advance Interest Amounts thereon to which it is entitled) and all other amounts to which the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer is entitled hereunder to the extent such amounts accrue prior to such effective date and (ii) with respect to a resignation by the Master Servicer, the successor Master Servicer has deposited into the Investment Accounts from which amounts were withdrawn to reimburse the terminated Master Servicer, an amount equal to the amounts so withdrawn, to the extent such amounts would not have been permitted to be withdrawn except pursuant to this paragraph, in which case the successor Master Servicer shall, immediately upon deposit, have the same right of reimbursement or payment as the terminated Master Servicer had immediately prior to its termination without regard to the operation of this paragraph.



 (d)           No resignation or removal of the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer or the Operating Advisor as contemplated by the preceding paragraphs of this Section 6.04 shall become effective until the Trustee or a successor Master Servicer, Special Servicer or Operating Advisor shall have assumed the resigning or terminated Master Servicer's, Special Servicer's or Operating Advisor's responsibilities, duties, liabilities and obligations hereunder.  If no successor Master Servicer, Special Servicer or Operating Advisor can be obtained to perform such







 obligations for the same compensation to which the terminated Master Servicer, Special Servicer or Operating Advisor would have been entitled, additional amounts payable to such successor Master Servicer, Special Servicer or Operating Advisor shall be treated as Realized Losses.



 (e)           The Operating Advisor shall have the right to resign without cost or expense upon the occurrence of the Early Termination Notice Date.  The Operating Advisor shall provide all of the parties to this Agreement and the Controlling Class Representative 30 days prior written notice of any such resignation pursuant to this Section 6.04(e).  If the Operating Advisor resigns pursuant to this Section 6.04(e), then no replacement Operating Advisor shall be appointed.  The resigning Operating Advisor shall be entitled, and subject, to any rights and obligations that accrued under this Agreement prior to the date of any such resignation (including accrued and unpaid compensation) and any indemnifications rights arising out of events occurring prior to such resignation.



 Section 6.05     Rights of the Depositor and the Trustee in Respect of the Master Servicer and the Special Servicer.  Solely with respect to their performance of their respective duties under this Agreement, the Master Servicer and the Special Servicer shall afford the Depositor, the Underwriters, the Initial Purchasers, the Certificate Administrator, the Trustee and the Rating Agencies, upon reasonable notice, during normal business hours access to all records maintained by it in respect of its rights and obligations hereunder and access to its officers responsible for such obligations.  Upon written request, the Master Servicer and/or the Special Servicer, as applicable, shall furnish to the Depositor, the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Certificate Administrator and the Trustee its most recent publicly available financial statements (or, with respect to the Master Servicer, those of its ultimate parent) and such other non-proprietary information as the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as the case may be, shall determine in its sole and absolute discretion as it possesses, which is relevant to the performance of its duties hereunder and which it is not prohibited by applicable law or contract from disclosing.  The Depositor may, but is not obligated to, enforce the obligations of the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer hereunder which are in default and may, but is not obligated to, perform, or cause a designee to perform, any defaulted obligation of such Person hereunder or exercise any rights of such Person hereunder, provided that the Master Servicer and the Special Servicer shall not be relieved of any of its obligations hereunder by virtue of such performance by the Depositor or its designee.  If the Depositor or its designee undertakes any such action, it will be reimbursed by the Trust Fund from the Collection Accounts (or with respect to a Serviced Loan Combination, to the extent such reimbursement is allocable to such Serviced Loan Combination Collection Account), as provided in Section 3.06 and Section 6.03(a) hereof to the extent not recoverable from the Master Servicer or Special Servicer, as applicable.  None of the Depositor, the Certificate Administrator, the Trustee, the Master Servicer (solely with respect to any action or failure to act by the Special Servicer) or the Special Servicer (solely with respect to any action or failure to act by the Master Servicer) shall have any responsibility or liability for any action or failure to act by the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer and no such party is obligated to monitor or supervise the performance of the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer under this Agreement or otherwise.  Neither the Master Servicer nor the Special Servicer shall be under any obligation to disclose confidential or proprietary information pursuant to this Section.







 Section 6.06     The Master Servicer or Special Servicer as Owners of a Certificate.  The Master Servicer or an Affiliate of the Master Servicer, or the Special Servicer or an Affiliate of the Special Servicer, may become the Holder (or with respect to a Global Certificate, Beneficial Owner) of any Certificate with the same rights it would have if it were not the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer or an Affiliate thereof.  If, at any time during which the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer or an Affiliate of the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer is the Holder or Beneficial Owner of any Certificate, the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer proposes to take action (including for this purpose, omitting to take action) that (i) is not expressly prohibited by the terms hereof and would not, in the Master Servicer's or the Special Servicer's good faith judgment, violate the Servicing Standard, and (ii) if taken, might nonetheless, in the Master Servicer's or the Special Servicer's good faith judgment, be considered by other Persons to violate the Servicing Standard, the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer may, but will not be required to, seek the approval of the Certificateholders to such action (or inaction) by delivering to the Certificate Administrator a written notice that (i) states that it is delivered pursuant to this Section 6.06, (ii) identifies the Percentage Interest in each Class of Certificates beneficially owned by the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer or an Affiliate of the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, and (iii) describes in reasonable detail the action (or inaction) that the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer proposes to take (or refrain from taking).  The Certificate Administrator, upon receipt of such notice, shall forward it to the Certificateholders (other than the Master Servicer and its Affiliates or the Special Servicer and its Affiliates, as appropriate) together with such instructions for response as the Certificate Administrator shall reasonably determine.  If at any time Certificateholders holding a majority of the Voting Rights of all Certificateholders and, if no Control Termination Event has occurred and is continuing, the applicable Directing Holder (calculated without regard to the Certificates beneficially owned by the Master Servicer or its Affiliates or the Special Servicer or its Affiliates, as applicable) shall have consented in writing to the proposal described in the written notice, and if the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer shall act as proposed in the written notice, such action shall be deemed to comply with the Servicing Standard.  The Certificate Administrator shall be entitled to reimbursement from the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as applicable, of the reasonable expenses of the Certificate Administrator incurred pursuant to this paragraph.  It is not the intent of the foregoing provision that the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer be permitted to invoke the procedure set forth herein with respect to routine servicing matters arising hereunder, except in the case of unusual circumstances.



 Section 6.07     The Directing Holder.  (a)  For so long as no Control Termination Event has occurred and is continuing, the Directing Holder shall be entitled to advise (1) the Special Servicer with respect to all Specially Serviced Loans, (2) the Special Servicer with respect to Performing Loans as to all matters for which the Master Servicer must obtain the consent or deemed consent of the Special Servicer or for which the Special Servicer will process, and (3) the Special Servicer with respect to all Mortgage Loans for which an extension of maturity is being considered by the Special Servicer or by the Master Servicer subject to consent or deemed consent of the Special Servicer, and notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, except as set forth in, and in any event subject to the second and third paragraphs of this Section 6.07, both (a) the Master Servicer, solely to the extent it is permitted to take any action constituting a Major Decision or Special Servicer Decision as set forth in Section 3.26 hereof, shall not be permitted to take any action constituting a Major Decision or Special Servicer Decision unless it has obtained the prior written consent of the Special Servicer and (b) for so







 long as no Control Termination Event has occurred and is continuing, the Special Servicer shall not be permitted to consent to the Master Servicer's taking any of the following actions nor will the Special Servicer itself be permitted to take any action constituting a Major Decision as to which the Directing Holder has objected in writing within ten (10) Business Days (or 30 days with respect to clause (j) of the definition of "Major Decision") after receipt of the written recommendation and analysis (provided that if such written objection has not been received by the Special Servicer within such ten (10) Business Day period (or 30 days with respect to clause (j) of the definition of "Major Decision" or such longer period provided for in any related Intercreditor Agreement but not less than five (5) Business Days after the time period set forth therein for Directing Holder approval), then the Directing Holder will be deemed to have approved such action); provided that, if the Special Servicer or Master Servicer (if the Master Servicer is otherwise authorized by this Agreement to take such action), as applicable, determines that immediate action, with respect to the foregoing matters, or any other matter requiring consent of the Directing Holder (if no Control Termination Event has occurred and is continuing) in this Agreement, is necessary to protect the interests of the Certificateholders and, with respect to any Serviced Loan Combination, the related Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders (as a collective whole as if such Certificateholders and, if applicable, Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders constituted a single lender) and the Special Servicer has made a reasonable effort to contact the Directing Holder, the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as the case may be, may take any such action without waiting for the Directing Holder's response.  The Special Servicer is not required to obtain the consent of the Directing Holder for any Major Decision if a Control Termination Event has occurred and is continuing; provided that, if a Control Termination Event has occurred and is continuing, the Special Servicer shall consult with the Operating Advisor in connection with any Major Decision and consider alternative actions recommended by the Operating Advisor; provided, further, that, if a Control Termination Event has occurred and is continuing but no Consultation Termination Event has occurred and is continuing, the Special Servicer shall consult with the Directing Holder in connection with any Major Decision and any other matters set forth in this Agreement as to which the consent or approval of the Directing Holder would have been required or as to which the Directing Holder would have had the right to advise or direct the Special Servicer or the Master Servicer if no Control Termination Event had occurred and was continuing and consider alternative actions recommended by the Directing Holder; provided, further, that such consultation with the Directing Holder or the Operating Advisor is not binding on the Special Servicer.



 In addition, for so long as no Control Termination Event has occurred and is continuing, the Directing Holder may direct the Special Servicer to take, or to refrain from taking, such other actions with respect to a Mortgage Loan as the Directing Holder may deem advisable or as to which provision is otherwise made herein; provided that, notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no such direction, and no objection contemplated by the preceding paragraph or this paragraph, may require or cause the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as applicable, to violate any provision of any Mortgage Loan, applicable law, this Agreement, any Intercreditor Agreement or the REMIC Provisions, including without limitation the Special Servicer's obligation to act in accordance with the Servicing Standard, or expose the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Paying Agent, the Trust Fund, the Certificate Administrator or the Trustee to liability, or materially expand the scope of the Special Servicer's responsibilities hereunder.







 If the Special Servicer or Master Servicer, as applicable, determines that a refusal to consent by the Directing Holder, or any advice from the Directing Holder, would otherwise cause the Special Servicer or Master Servicer, as applicable, to violate the terms of any Mortgage Loan, any Intercreditor Agreement, applicable law, the REMIC Provisions or this Agreement, including without limitation, the Servicing Standard, the Special Servicer or Master Servicer, as applicable, shall disregard such refusal to consent or advice and notify the Directing Holder, the Trustee, the related Serviced Companion Loan Noteholder (if any) and the 17g-5 Information Provider (who shall promptly post such notice to the 17g-5 Information Provider's Website pursuant to Section 3.14(d) of this Agreement), of its determination, including a reasonably detailed explanation of the basis therefor.  The taking of, or refraining from taking, any action by the Master Servicer or Special Servicer in accordance with the direction of or approval of the Directing Holder that does not violate any law or the Servicing Standard or any other provisions of this Agreement or any Intercreditor Agreement, will not result in any liability on the part of the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer.



 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, with respect to the Non-Serviced Mortgage Loans, (i) at all times when no Consultation Termination Event has occurred and is continuing, the Controlling Class Representative shall be entitled to the rights of the "Non-Directing Holder" (or similar term) under the related Intercreditor Agreement and (ii) at no time shall the Operating Advisor be entitled to the rights of the "Non-Directing Holder" (or similar term) under the related Intercreditor Agreement.



 The Directing Holder shall have no liability to the Trust Fund, any party to this Agreement, any Certificateholders or any other Person for any action taken, or for refraining from the taking of any action, or for errors in judgment; provided that the Directing Holder shall not be protected against any liability to a Controlling Class Certificateholder  that would otherwise be imposed by reason of willful misfeasance or bad faith or negligence in the performance of duties or by reason of negligent disregard of obligations or duties.  By its acceptance of a Certificate, each Certificateholder acknowledges and agrees that the Directing Holder may take actions that favor the interests of one or more Classes of the Certificates including the Holders of the Controlling Class over other Classes of the Certificates, and that the Directing Holder may have special relationships and interests that conflict with those of Holders of some Classes of the Certificates, that the Directing Holder may act solely in the interests of the Holders of the Controlling Class, that the Directing Holder does not have any duties or liability to the Holders of any Class of Certificates other than the Controlling Class, that the Directing Holder shall not be liable to any Certificateholder, by reason of its having acted solely in the interests of the Holders of the Controlling Class, and that the Directing Holder shall have no liability whatsoever for having so acted, and no Certificateholder may take any action whatsoever against the Directing Holder or any director, officer, employee, agent or principal thereof for having so acted.



 (b)           Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein (i) if a Control Termination Event has occurred and is continuing, the Directing Holder shall have no right to consent to any action taken or not taken by any party to this Agreement; (ii) if a Control Termination Event has occurred and is continuing but no Consultation Termination Event has occurred and is continuing, the Directing Holder shall remain entitled to receive any notices, reports or information to which it is entitled pursuant to this Agreement, and the Master Servicer,







 Special Servicer and any other applicable party shall consult with the Directing Holder in connection with any action to be taken or refrained from taking to the extent set forth herein; and (iii) if a Consultation Termination Event has occurred and is continuing, the Directing Holder shall have no consultation or consent rights hereunder and no right to receive any notices, reports or information (other than notices, Voting Rights given to all Certificateholders and rights to receive reports or information required to be delivered to all Certificateholders) or any other rights as Directing Holder.



 (c)           The Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Trustee or the Operating Advisor may from time to time request that the Certificate Administrator provide the name of the then-current Directing Holder for any applicable Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination.  Upon such request, the Certificate Administrator shall promptly (but in no event more than five (5) Business Days following such request) provide the name of the then-current Directing Holder to the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Trustee or the Operating Advisor, as applicable, but only to the extent the Certificate Administrator has actual knowledge of the identity of the then-current Directing Holder; provided that if the Certificate Administrator does not have actual knowledge of the identity of the then-current Directing Holder, then (i) the Certificate Administrator shall determine which Class is the Controlling Class and (ii) the Certificate Administrator shall promptly (but in no event more than five (5) Business Days following such request) request from the Depository, the list of Beneficial Owners of the Controlling Class, and the Certificate Administrator shall provide such list to the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Trustee or the Operating Advisor.  Any expenses incurred in connection with obtaining such information shall be at the expense of the requesting party, except that if (i) such expenses arise in connection with an event as to which the Directing Holder (or Controlling Class Representative) has review, consent or consultation rights with respect to an action taken by, or report prepared by, the requesting party pursuant to this Agreement and (ii) the requesting party has not been notified of the identity of the Directing Holder (or Controlling Class Representative) or reasonably believes that the identity of the Directing Holder (or Controlling Class Representative) has changed, then such expenses shall be at the expense of the Trust.  The Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Trustee and the Operating Advisor shall be entitled to conclusively rely on any such information so provided.



 To the extent the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer has written notice of any change in the identity of a Directing Holder or the list of Holders (or Beneficial Owners, if applicable) of the Controlling Class, then the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as applicable, shall promptly notify the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator, the Operating Advisor, the Master Servicer and the Special Servicer thereof, who may rely conclusively on such notice from the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as applicable.



 Section 6.08     Rights of Non-Directing Holders.  With respect to each Serviced Loan Combination, the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as applicable, shall:



 (a)           consult with the related Non-Directing Holder (or its designee or representative) on a strictly non-binding basis, to the extent that such Non-Directing Holder (or its designee or representative) requests consultation with respect to any "major decision" or "major action" set forth in the related Intercreditor Agreement or the implementation of any recommended actions outlined in an Asset Status Report relating to the Serviced Loan Combination, and to consider alternative actions recommended by such Non-Directing Holder







 (or its designee or representative); provided, that after the expiration of a period of ten (10) Business Days from the delivery to the related Non-Directing Holder (or its designee or representative) of written notice of a proposed action, together with copies of the related notice, information or report, the Master Servicer or Special Servicer, as applicable, shall no longer be obligated to consult with the applicable Non-Directing Holder (or its designee or representative) (unless the Master Servicer or Special Servicer, as applicable, proposes a new course of action that is materially different from the action previously proposed, in which case such ten (10) Business Day period shall begin anew from the date of such proposal and delivery of all information relating thereto).

 of a Serviced Companion Loan, as and when required by this Agreement or any related Intercreditor Agreement, any amount required to be so remitted (which failure continues for two Business Days);



 (ii)       any failure on the part of the Master Servicer duly to observe or perform in any material respect any of its other covenants or obligations contained in this Agreement, which failure continues unremedied for a period of 30 days (15 days in the case of the Master Servicer's failure to make a Property Advance or 45 days in the case of failure to pay the premium for any insurance policy required to be force placed by the Master Servicer pursuant to this Agreement or in any event such reasonable shorter period of time as is necessary to avoid the commencement of foreclosure proceedings for any lien relating to unpaid real estate taxes or assessments or a lapse in any required insurance coverage) after the date on which written notice of such failure, requiring the same to be remedied, shall have been given to the Master Servicer, by (a) any other party hereto, with a copy to each other party to this Agreement, (b) the Holders of Certificates of any Class evidencing Percentage Interests aggregating not less than 25% of such Class or (c) an affected Serviced Companion Loan Noteholder; provided, if such failure is capable of being cured and the Master Servicer is diligently pursuing such cure, such 15-, 30- or 45-day period, as applicable, will be extended an additional 30 days;



 (iii)       any breach on the part of the Master Servicer of any representation or warranty contained in Section 2.04(a) of this Agreement, which materially and adversely affects the interests of any Class of Certificateholders or Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders and which continues unremedied for a period of 30 days after the date on which notice of such breach, requiring the same to be remedied, shall have been given (a) to the Master Servicer by any party hereto or (b) to the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Depositor and the Trustee (x) by the Holders of Certificates of any Class evidencing Percentage Interests aggregating not less than 25% of such Class or (y) by an affected Serviced Companion Loan Noteholder; provided, if such breach is capable of being cured and the Master Servicer is diligently pursuing such cure, such 30-day period will be extended an additional 30 days;



 (iv)       a decree or order of a court or agency or supervisory authority having jurisdiction in the premises in an involuntary case under any present or future federal or state bankruptcy, insolvency or similar law for the appointment of a conservator, receiver, liquidator, trustee or similar official in any bankruptcy, insolvency, readjustment of debt, marshaling of assets and liabilities or similar proceedings, or for the winding-up or liquidation of its affairs, shall have been entered against the Master Servicer and such decree or order shall have remained in force undischarged, undismissed or unstayed for a period of 60 days;



 (v)       the Master Servicer shall consent to the appointment of a conservator, receiver, liquidator, trustee or similar official in any bankruptcy, insolvency, readjustment of debt, marshaling of assets and liabilities or similar proceedings of or relating to the Master Servicer or of or relating to all or substantially all of its property;



 (vi)       the Master Servicer shall admit in writing its inability to pay its debts generally as they become due, file a petition to take advantage of any applicable







 bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization statute, make an assignment for the benefit of its creditors, voluntarily suspend payment of its obligations or take any corporate action in furtherance of the foregoing;



 (vii)       (a) the Master Servicer ceases to have a master servicer rating of at least "CMS3" from Fitch and such rating is not reinstated within sixty (60) days; or (b) either Moody's or KBRA has (A) qualified, downgraded or withdrawn its rating or ratings of one or more Classes of Certificates or Serviced Companion Loan Securities, or (B) placed one or more Classes of Certificates or Serviced Companion Loan Securities on "watch status" in contemplation of possible rating downgrade or withdrawal (and such qualification, downgrade or withdrawal or "watch status" placement shall not have been withdrawn by Moody's or KBRA, as applicable, within sixty (60) days of such actual knowledge by the Master Servicer), and, in case of either of clause (A) or (B), citing servicing concerns with the Master Servicer as the sole or a material factor in such rating action; or



 (viii)        subject to Section 10.16(c), any failure by the Master Servicer to deliver (a) any Exchange Act reporting items required to be delivered by the Master Servicer to the Trustee or the Certificate Administrator under Article X (other than items to be delivered by a Mortgage Loan Seller Sub-Servicer) by the time required under Article X after any applicable grace periods or (b) any Exchange Act reporting items that a primary servicer, sub-servicer or Servicing Function Participant (such entity, the "Sub-Servicing Entity") retained by the Master Servicer (but excluding any Mortgage Loan Seller Sub-Servicer) is required to deliver (any Sub-Servicing Entity shall be terminated if it defaults in accordance with the provision of this clause (viii));



 then, and in each and every such case, so long as a Master Servicer Termination Event shall not have been remedied, the Trustee may, and at the written direction of (x) the Holders of at least 51% of the aggregate Voting Rights of all Certificates or (y) the Depositor with respect to clause (viii) above upon five (5) Business Days' notice, shall, terminate all of the rights and obligations of the Master Servicer (other than as set forth in Section 7.01(d)). Upon (i) written direction of the holders of Certificates evidencing at least 25% of the aggregate Voting Rights requesting a vote to terminate the Master Servicer in connection with the occurrence and continuance of a Master Servicer Termination Event and (ii) payment by such holders to the Certificate Administrator and the Trustee of the reasonable fees and expenses to be incurred by the Certificate Administrator and the Trustee in connection with administering such vote, the Certificate Administrator shall be required to promptly provide written notice to all Certificateholders of such request by posting such notice on its internet website and conduct the solicitation of votes of all Certificates, within 180 days of the posting of such notice, in such regard.  In the case of clause (vii), the Certificate Administrator shall be required to notify Certificateholders and Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders of such Master Servicer Termination Event and request whether such Certificateholders and, if applicable, Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders favor such termination.



 If the Master Servicer is also the Special Servicer and the Master Servicer is terminated as provided in this Section 7.01, then the Master Servicer shall also be terminated as Special Servicer.







 If the Master Servicer receives notice of termination under this Section 7.01(a) solely due to a Master Servicer Termination Event under Section 7.01(a)(vii) and if the Master Servicer provides the Trustee with the appropriate "request for proposal" materials within five (5) Business Days following such termination notice, then the Master Servicer shall continue to serve as Master Servicer hereunder until a successor Master Servicer is selected in accordance with this Section 7.01(a).  Upon receipt of the "request for proposal" materials, the Trustee shall promptly thereafter (using such "request for proposal" materials provided by the Master Servicer) solicit good faith bids for the rights to service the Mortgage Loans and Serviced Companion Loans under this Agreement from at least three (3) Persons qualified to act as Master Servicer hereunder in accordance with Section 6.02 and 7.02 of this Agreement (any such Person so qualified, a "Qualified Bidder") or, if three (3) Qualified Bidders cannot be located, then from as many persons as the Trustee can determine are Qualified Bidders; provided that, at the Trustee's request, the Master Servicer shall supply the Trustee with the names of Persons from whom to solicit such bids; and provided, further, that the Trustee shall not be responsible if less than three (3) or no Qualified Bidders submit bids for the right to service the Mortgage Loans and Serviced Companion Loans under this Agreement.  The bid proposal shall require any Successful Bidder (as defined below), as a condition of such bid, to enter into this Agreement as successor Master Servicer, and to agree to be bound by the terms hereof, within 45 days after the notice of termination of the Master Servicer.  The materials provided to the Trustee shall provide for soliciting bids:  (i) on the basis of such successor Master Servicer retaining all Sub-Servicers to continue the primary servicing of the Mortgage Loans and Serviced Companion Loans pursuant to the terms of the respective Sub-Servicing Agreements and entering into a Sub-Servicing Agreement with the terminated Master Servicer to service each of the Mortgage Loans and Serviced Companion Loans for which it was the Master Servicer and not subject to a Sub-Servicing Agreement at a sub-servicing fee rate per annum equal to, for each Mortgage Loan and Serviced Companion Loan serviced, the excess of the related Servicing Fee Rate minus the related Excess Servicing Fee Rate (each, a "Servicing Retained Bid"); and (ii) on the basis of terminating each Sub-Servicing Agreement and Sub-Servicer that it is permitted to terminate in accordance with Section 3.01(c) of this Agreement (each, a "Servicing Released Bid").  The Trustee shall select the Qualified Bidder with the highest cash Servicing Retained Bid (or, if none, the highest cash Servicing Released Bid) (the "Successful Bidder") to act as successor Master Servicer hereunder; provided, that if the Trustee does not receive a No Downgrade Confirmation in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 3.30 of this Agreement with respect to such Successful Bidder, then the Trustee shall repeat the bid process described above (but subject to the above described 45 day time period) until such No Downgrade Confirmation is obtained.  The Trustee shall direct the Successful Bidder to enter into this Agreement as successor Master Servicer pursuant to the terms hereof no later than 45 days after notice of the termination of the Master Servicer; provided, that the initial Master Servicer may request and obtain, with the prior written consent of the Directing Holder, an additional 20 days for such sale and assumption to be completed so long as the initial Master Servicer delivers to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate stating that the sale and assumption of the right to service the Mortgage Loans and Serviced Companion Loans cannot be completed in the initial 45-day period and specifying the reasons therefor.



 Upon the assignment and acceptance of master servicing rights hereunder (subject to the terms of Section 3.12 of this Agreement) to and by the Successful Bidder, the Trustee shall remit or cause to be remitted (i) if the successful bid was a Servicing Retained Bid, to the Master







 Servicer to be terminated pursuant to this Section 7.01(a), the amount of such cash bid received from the Successful Bidder (net of "out of pocket" expenses incurred in connection with obtaining such bid and transferring servicing) and (ii) if the successful bid was a Servicing Released Bid, to the Master Servicer and each terminated Sub-Servicer its respective Bid Allocation.



 The Master Servicer to be terminated pursuant to this Section 7.01(a) shall be responsible for all out of pocket expenses incurred in connection with the attempt to sell its rights to service the Mortgage Loans and Serviced Companion Loans, which expenses are not reimbursed to the party that incurred such expenses pursuant to the preceding paragraph.



 If the Successful Bidder has not entered into this Agreement as successor Master Servicer within the above described time period or no Successful Bidder was identified within the above described time period, the Master Servicer to be terminated pursuant to Section 7.01(a) of this Agreement shall reimburse the Trustee for all reasonable "out of pocket" expenses incurred by the Trustee in connection with such bid process and the Trustee shall have no further obligations under this Section 7.01(a).  The Trustee thereafter may act or may select a successor to act as Master Servicer hereunder in accordance with Section 7.02 of this Agreement.



 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article VII, if the Master Servicer shall timely deliver the notice and request for proposal materials referred to in the fourth preceding paragraph, no resignation or termination of the Master Servicer shall be effective in connection with a Master Servicer Termination Event under Section 7.01(a)(vii) of this Agreement, and the Master Servicer shall continue to perform as such and to collect the servicing fee until the conclusion of the process described in this Section 7.01(a).



 (b)           "Special Servicer Termination Event," wherever used herein, means any one of the following events:



 (i)              any failure by the Special Servicer to deposit into the REO Account at or within the time specified by this Agreement and such failure continues unremedied for two Business Days, or any failure by the Special Servicer to remit to Master Servicer for deposit into, the Collection Account (or, in the case of a Serviced Loan Combination, the related Serviced Loan Combination Collection Account) any amount required to be so remitted by the Special Servicer pursuant to, and at the time specified by, the terms of this Agreement; provided, that the failure of the Special Servicer to remit such amount to the Master Servicer shall not be a Special Servicer Termination Event if such failure is remedied within two Business Days and if the Special Servicer has compensated the Master Servicer for any loss of income on such amount suffered by the Master Servicer due to and caused by the late remittance of the Special Servicer and reimburse the Trust for any resulting Advance Interest Amount due to the Master Servicer;



 (ii)              any failure on the part of the Special Servicer duly to observe or perform in any material respect any of its other covenants or obligations contained in this Agreement, which failure continues unremedied for a period of 30 days (45 days in the case of failure to pay the premium for any insurance policy required to be force placed by the Special Servicer pursuant to this Agreement or in any event such reasonable shorter period of time as is necessary to avoid the commencement of foreclosure proceedings for







 any lien relating to unpaid real estate taxes or assessments or a lapse in any required insurance coverage) after the date on which written notice of such failure, requiring the same to be remedied, shall have been given to the Special Servicer, by (a) any other party hereto, with a copy to each other party to this Agreement, (b) the Holders of Certificates of any Class evidencing Percentage Interests aggregating not less than 25% of such Class or (c) an affected Serviced Companion Loan Noteholder; provided, if such failure is capable of being cured and the Special Servicer is diligently pursuing such cure, such 30- or 45-day period, as applicable, will be extended an additional 30 days;

 (iv)              a decree or order of a court or agency or supervisory authority having jurisdiction in the premises in an involuntary case under any present or future federal or state bankruptcy, insolvency or similar law for the appointment of a conservator, receiver, liquidator, trustee or similar official in any bankruptcy, insolvency, readjustment of debt, marshaling of assets and liabilities or similar proceedings, or for the winding-up or liquidation of its affairs, shall have been entered against the Special Servicer and such decree or order shall have remained in force undischarged, undismissed or unstayed for a period of 60 days;



 (v)              the Special Servicer shall consent to the appointment of a conservator, receiver, liquidator, trustee or similar official in any bankruptcy, insolvency, readjustment of debt, marshaling of assets and liabilities or similar proceedings of or relating to the Special Servicer or of or relating to all or substantially all of its property;



 (vi)              the Special Servicer shall admit in writing its inability to pay its debts generally as they become due, file a petition to take advantage of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization statute, make an assignment for the benefit of its creditors, voluntarily suspend payment of its obligations or take any corporate action in furtherance of the foregoing;



 (vii)              (a) the Special Servicer ceases to have a special servicer rating of at least "CSS3" from Fitch and such rating is not reinstated within sixty (60) days; or (b) either Moody's or KBRA has (A) qualified, downgraded or withdrawn its rating or ratings of one or more Classes of Certificates or Serviced Companion Loan Securities, or (B) placed one or more Classes of Certificates or Serviced Companion Loan Securities on "watch status" in contemplation of possible rating downgrade or withdrawal (and such qualification, downgrade or withdrawal or "watch status" placement shall not have been







 withdrawn by Moody's or KBRA, as applicable, within sixty (60) days of such actual knowledge by the Special Servicer), and, in case of either of clause (A) or (B), citing servicing concerns with the Special Servicer as the sole or a material factor in such rating action; or



 (viii)              subject to Section 10.16(c), any failure by the Special Servicer to deliver (a) any Exchange Act reporting items required to be delivered by the Special Servicer to the Trustee or the Certificate Administrator under Article X by the time required under Article X after any applicable grace periods or (b) any Exchange Act reporting items that a primary servicer, sub-servicer or Servicing Function Participant (such entity, the "Sub-Servicing Entity") retained by the Special Servicer (but excluding any Mortgage Loan Seller Sub-Servicer) is required to deliver (any Sub-Servicing Entity shall be terminated if it defaults in accordance with the provision of this clause (viii);



 then, and in each and every such case, so long as a Special Servicer Termination Event shall not have been remedied, the Trustee may, and at the written direction of (x) the Holders of at least 51% of the aggregate Voting Rights of all Certificates, (y) for so long as no Control Termination Event has occurred and is continuing, the Directing Holder or (z) the Depositor with respect to clause (viii) above upon five (5) Business Days' notice, shall, terminate all of the rights and obligations of the Special Servicer (other than the rights to indemnification provided in Section 6.03(a) of this Agreement and compensation provided in Section 3.12(c) of this Agreement).  Upon (i) written direction of the holders of Certificates evidencing at least 25% of the aggregate Voting Rights requesting a vote to terminate the Special Servicer in connection with the occurrence and continuance of a Special Servicer Termination Event and (ii) payment by such holders to the Certificate Administrator and the Trustee of the reasonable fees and expenses to be incurred by the Certificate Administrator and the Trustee in connection with administering such vote, the Certificate Administrator shall be required to promptly provide written notice to all Certificateholders of such request by posting such notice on its internet website and conduct the solicitation of votes of all Certificates, within 180 days of such notice, in such regard.  In the case of clause (vii) above, the Trustee shall, upon actual knowledge of such Special Servicer Termination Event, be required to notify the Special Servicer and the Certificate Administrator, and the Certificate Administrator, upon receipt of such notice or upon actual knowledge of such Special Servicer Termination Event, shall notify the Certificateholders and Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders of such Special Servicer Termination Event and request whether such Certificateholders and, if applicable, the Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders favor such termination.

 due to such default) with respect all of the rights and obligations of the Master Servicer under this Agreement related to such Serviced Loan Combination. The Master Servicer shall appoint a replacement sub-servicer with respect to such Serviced Loan Combination; provided, that such sub-servicer meets the eligibility requirements of a successor master servicer under Section 7.02 (including receipt of a No Downgrade Confirmation relating to the Certificates and Serviced Companion Loan Securities, if any) and the eligibility requirements of each Other Pooling and Servicing Agreement.

 (e)           If the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer is terminated pursuant to this Section 7.01, the Trustee (the "Terminating Party") shall, by notice in writing to the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as the case may be (the "Terminated Party"), terminate all of its rights and obligations under this Agreement and in and to the Mortgage Loans and the proceeds thereof, other than any rights the Terminated Party has to Excess Servicing Fees, any rights it has hereunder as a Certificateholder and any rights or obligations that accrued prior to the date of such termination (including the right to receive all amounts accrued or owing to it under this Agreement, plus interest at the Advance Rate on such amounts until received to the extent such amounts bear interest as provided in this Agreement, with respect to periods prior to the date of such termination and the right to the benefits of Section 6.03 of this Agreement notwithstanding any such termination), and with respect to the Special Servicer, the right to receive any Workout Fee subsequent to its termination as Special Servicer, pursuant to Section 3.12(c) of this Agreement.  No successor Special Servicer shall be entitled to such Workout Fee received by the terminated Special Servicer.  On or after the receipt by the Terminated Party of such written notice, all of its authority and power under this Agreement, whether with respect to the Certificates (except that the Terminated Party shall retain its rights as a Certificateholder if and to the extent that it is a Certificateholder), the Mortgage Loans, the Serviced Companion Loans or otherwise, shall pass to and be vested in the Terminating Party pursuant to and under this Section and, without limitation, the Terminating Party is hereby authorized and empowered to execute and deliver, on behalf of and at the expense of the Terminated Party, as attorney-in-fact or otherwise, any and all documents and other instruments, and to do or accomplish all other acts or things necessary or appropriate to effect the purposes of such notice of termination, whether to complete the transfer and endorsement or assignment of the Mortgage Loans and related documents, or otherwise.  The Master Servicer and the Special Servicer each agree in the event it is terminated pursuant to this Section 7.01 to promptly (and in any event no later than ten Business Days subsequent to such notice) provide, at its own expense, the Terminating Party with all documents and records requested by the Terminating Party to enable the Terminating Party to assume its functions hereunder, and to cooperate with the Terminating Party and the successor to its responsibilities hereunder in effecting the termination of its responsibilities and rights hereunder, including, without limitation, the transfer to the successor Master Servicer or Special Servicer or the Terminating Party, as applicable, for administration by it of all cash







 amounts which shall at the time be or should have been credited by the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer to the Collection Account, the applicable Serviced Loan Combination Collection Account, any REO Account, the Loss of Value Reserve Fund, any Excess Liquidation Proceeds Account, Lock-Box Account or Cash Collateral Account or which shall thereafter be received with respect to the Mortgage Loans, and shall promptly provide the Terminating Party or such successor Master Servicer or successor Special Servicer (which may include the Trustee) all documents and records reasonably requested by it, such documents and records to be provided in such form as the Terminating Party or such successor Master Servicer or Special Servicer shall reasonably request (including electronic form), to enable it to assume the Master Servicer's or Special Servicer's function hereunder.  All reasonable costs and expenses of the Terminating Party (including the cost of obtaining a No Downgrade Confirmation and any applicable indemnity) or the successor Master Servicer or successor Special Servicer incurred in connection with transferring the Mortgage Files to the successor Master Servicer or Special Servicer and amending this Agreement to reflect such succession as successor Master Servicer or successor Special Servicer pursuant to this Section 7.01 shall be paid by the predecessor Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as applicable, upon presentation of reasonable documentation of such costs and expenses.  If the predecessor Master Servicer or Special Servicer (as the case may be) has not reimbursed the Terminating Party or the successor Master Servicer or Special Servicer for such expenses within 90 days after the presentation of reasonable documentation, such expense shall be reimbursed by the Trust Fund; provided that the Terminated Party shall not thereby be relieved of its liability for such expenses.  If and to the extent that the Terminated Party has not reimbursed such costs and expenses, the Terminating Party shall have an affirmative obligation to take all reasonable actions to collect such expenses on behalf of the Trust Fund.



 In no event shall the Trustee or the Certificate Administrator be deemed to have knowledge of, or be aware of, any Master Servicer Termination Event or Special Servicer Termination Event until a Responsible Officer of the Trustee or the Certificate Administrator, as the case may be, has received written notice thereof or has actual knowledge thereof.



 Section 7.02     Trustee to Act; Appointment of Successor.  Upon the receipt of a notice of termination by the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer pursuant to Section 7.01 of this Agreement, the Terminating Party (subject to Section 7.01(a) and Section 7.01(c)) shall be its successor, until a successor is appointed by the Directing Holder as provided in this Section 7.02 or Section 3.22(b), as applicable, in all respects in its capacity as the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer under this Agreement and the transactions set forth or provided for herein and, except as provided herein, shall be subject to all the responsibilities, duties, limitations on liability and liabilities relating thereto and arising thereafter placed on the Master Servicer or Special Servicer by the terms and provisions hereof, provided, that (i) the Terminating Party shall have no responsibilities, duties, liabilities or obligations with respect to any act or omission of the Master Servicer or Special Servicer and (ii) any failure to perform, or delay in performing, such duties or responsibilities caused by the Terminated Party's failure to provide, or delay in providing, records, tapes, disks, information or monies shall not be considered a termination event for such successor hereunder.  The Trustee, as successor Master Servicer







 or successor Special Servicer, shall be indemnified to the full extent provided to the Master Servicer or Special Servicer, as applicable, under this Agreement prior to the Master Servicer's or the Special Servicer's termination.  The appointment of a successor Master Servicer or successor Special Servicer shall not affect any liability of the predecessor Master Servicer or Special Servicer which may have arisen prior to its termination as the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer.  The Terminating Party shall not be liable for any of the representations and warranties of the Master Servicer or Special Servicer herein or in any related document or agreement, for any acts or omissions of the predecessor Master Servicer or predecessor Special Servicer or for any losses incurred in respect of any Permitted Investment by the Master Servicer pursuant to Section 3.07 hereunder nor shall the Trustee be required to purchase any Mortgage Loan or any Serviced Companion Loan hereunder.  As compensation therefor, the Terminating Party as successor Master Servicer or successor Special Servicer shall be entitled to the Servicing Compensation or Special Servicing Compensation, as applicable, and all funds relating to the Mortgage Loans or the Serviced Companion Loans that accrue after the date of the Terminating Party's succession to which such predecessor Master Servicer or Special Servicer would have been entitled if such predecessor Master Servicer or Special Servicer, as applicable, had continued to act hereunder.  If any Advances made by the Master Servicer or the Trustee shall at any time be outstanding, or any amounts of interest thereon shall be accrued and unpaid, all amounts available to repay Advances and interest hereunder shall be applied entirely to the Advances made by the Trustee (and the accrued and unpaid interest thereon), until such Advances and interest shall have been repaid in full.  Notwithstanding the above, the Trustee may, if it shall be unwilling to so act, or shall if it is unable to so act or if the Holders of Certificates entitled to (i) in the case of the Master Servicer, at least 25% of the aggregate Voting Rights (or, for so long as no Control Termination Event has occurred and is continuing, the Controlling Class Representative), or (ii) in the case of the Special Servicer, at least 25% of the aggregate Voting Rights (or, for so long as no Control Termination Event has occurred and is continuing, the Directing Holder), so request in writing to the Trustee, or, with respect to a Serviced Loan Combination, if an affected Serviced Companion Loan Noteholder so requests in writing to the Trustee, or if the Trustee is not an "approved" servicer by any of the Rating Agencies for mortgage pools similar to the Trust Fund, promptly appoint, or petition a court of competent jurisdiction to appoint, any established mortgage loan servicing institution that, for so long as no Control Termination Event has occurred and is continuing, has been approved by the Directing Holder (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld) to act as the successor to the Master Servicer or Special Servicer, as applicable, hereunder in the assumption of all or any part of the responsibilities, duties or liabilities of the Master Servicer or Special Servicer hereunder; provided that the Trustee shall obtain a No Downgrade Confirmation with respect to the Certificates and any Serviced Companion Loan Securities.  No appointment of a successor to the Master Servicer or Special Servicer hereunder shall be effective until the assumption by such successor of all the Master Servicer's or Special Servicer's responsibilities, duties and liabilities hereunder, which appointment has been approved, if no Control Termination Event has occurred and is continuing, by the Directing Holder, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld.  Pending appointment of a successor to the Master Servicer (or the Special Servicer if the Special Servicer is also the Master Servicer) hereunder, unless the Trustee shall be prohibited by law from so acting, the Trustee shall act in such capacity as hereinabove provided.  Pending the appointment of a successor to the Special Servicer, the Trustee shall act in such capacity.  In connection with such appointment and assumption described herein, the Trustee may make such arrangements for the compensation of such successor out of payments on Mortgage Loans, Serviced Companion Loans or otherwise as it and such successor shall agree; provided, that no such compensation shall be in excess of that permitted to the Terminated Party hereunder, unless no successor to the Terminated Party can be obtained to perform the obligations of such







 Terminated Party hereunder, in which case additional amounts shall be paid to such successor and such amounts in excess of that permitted the Terminated Party shall be treated as Realized Losses.  Any successor Special Servicer shall be subject to the rights of the Directing Holder under Section 3.22(b) of this Agreement.  The Depositor, the Trustee, the Master Servicer or Special Servicer and such successor shall take such action, consistent with this Agreement, as shall be necessary to effectuate any such succession.



 If the Trustee or an Affiliate acts pursuant to this Section 7.02 as successor to the resigning or terminated Master Servicer, it may reduce the Master Servicer's Excess Servicing Fee Rate to the extent that its or such Affiliate's compensation as successor Master Servicer would otherwise be below the market rate servicing compensation.  If the Trustee elects to appoint a successor to the resigning or terminated Master Servicer other than itself or an Affiliate pursuant to this Section 7.02, it may reduce the Master Servicer's Excess Servicing Fee Rate to the extent reasonably necessary (in the sole discretion of the Trustee) for the Trustee to appoint a qualified successor Master Servicer that meets the requirements of this Section 7.02.



 Section 7.03     Notification to Certificateholders and Other Persons.  (a)  Upon its receipt of written notice of any termination pursuant to Section 7.01 above or appointment of a successor to the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, the Certificate Administrator shall give prompt written notice thereof to Certificateholders at their respective addresses appearing in the Certificate Register, the 17g-5 Information Provider (who shall promptly post such notice to the 17g-5 Information Provider's Website pursuant to Section 3.14(d) of this Agreement), the Operating Advisor, and to each Serviced Companion Loan Noteholder at its address appearing in the Serviced Companion Loan Noteholder Register.



 (b)           Within 30 days after the occurrence of any Servicer Termination Event or Operating Advisor Termination Event of which a Responsible Officer of the Trustee has actual knowledge, the Trustee shall transmit by mail to the Depositor, the Certificate Administrator (who shall then notify all Holders of Certificates), the 17g-5 Information Provider (who shall promptly post such notice to the 17g-5 Information Provider's Website pursuant to Section 3.14(d) of this Agreement), and each Serviced Companion Loan Noteholder, notice of such Servicer Termination Event or Operating Advisor Termination Event, unless such Servicer Termination Event or Operating Advisor Termination Event shall have been cured or waived.



 Section 7.04     Other Remedies of Trustee.  During the continuance of any Servicer Termination Event, so long as the Servicer Termination Event shall not have been remedied, the Trustee, in addition to the rights specified in Section 7.01 of this Agreement, shall have the right, in its own name as Trustee of an express trust, to take all actions now or hereafter existing at law, in equity or by statute to enforce its rights and remedies and to protect the interests, and enforce the rights and remedies, of the Certificateholders and, in the case of any Serviced Companion Loan, of the related Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders (including the institution and prosecution of all judicial, administrative and other proceedings and the filing of proofs of claim and debt in connection therewith).  In such event, the legal fees, expenses and costs of such action and any liability resulting therefrom shall be expenses, costs and liabilities of the Trust Fund (and, in the case of any Serviced Loan Combination, such amounts shall be allocated in accordance with the expense allocation provision of the related Intercreditor Agreement).  Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, no remedy provided for by this Agreement shall be exclusive of any other remedy, and each and every remedy shall be







 cumulative and in addition to any other remedy, and no delay or omission to exercise any right or remedy shall impair any such right or remedy or shall be deemed to be a waiver of any Servicer Termination Event.



 Section 7.05     Waiver of Past Servicer Termination Events and Operating Advisor Termination Events; Termination.  The Holders of Certificates evidencing not less than 66-2/3% of the aggregate Voting Rights of the Certificates may, together with each affected Serviced Companion Loan Noteholder (to the extent they are adversely affected by such Servicer Termination Event or Operating Advisor Termination Event, as applicable), on behalf of all Holders of Certificates waive any termination event with respect to the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer or the Operating Advisor in the performance of its obligations hereunder and its consequences, except a termination event with respect to making any required deposits (including, with respect to the Master Servicer, P&I Advances) to or payments from the Collection Account, any Serviced Loan Combination Collection Account or the Lower-Tier Distribution Account, or in remitting payments as received, in each case in accordance with this Agreement.  Upon any such waiver of a past termination event, such termination event shall cease to exist, and any Servicer Termination Event or Operating Advisor Termination Event arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been remedied for every purpose of this Agreement.  No such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other termination event or impair any right consequent thereon.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Master Servicer Termination Event under Section 7.01(a)(viii) or a Special Servicer Termination Event under Section 7.01(b)(viii) of this Agreement may be waived only with the consent of the Depositor.



 Section 7.06     Trustee as Maker of Advances.  If the Master Servicer fails to fulfill its obligations hereunder to make any Advances and such failure remains uncured, the Trustee shall perform such obligations (x) within five Business Days of the Master Servicer Termination Event resulting from such failure by the Master Servicer with respect to Property Advances to the extent a Responsible Officer of the Trustee has actual knowledge of such failure with respect to such Property Advances and (y) by 12:00 noon (New York City time) on the related Distribution Date with respect to P&I Advances pursuant to the Trustee's receipt of notice of failure pursuant to Section 4.07(a) of this Agreement unless the Trustee has received notice that such failure has been cured by 11:00 axxPDmxxPD on such Distribution Date.  With respect to any such Advance made by the Trustee, the Trustee shall succeed to all of the Master Servicer's rights with respect to Advances hereunder, including, without limitation, the Master Servicer's rights of reimbursement and interest on each Advance at the Advance Rate, and rights to determine that a proposed Advance is a Nonrecoverable Advance (without regard to any impairment of any such rights of reimbursement caused by the Master Servicer's failure to perform its obligations hereunder); provided, that if Advances made by the Trustee and the Master Servicer shall at any time be outstanding, or any interest on any Advance shall be accrued and unpaid, all amounts available to repay such Advances and the interest thereon hereunder shall be applied entirely to the Advances outstanding to the Trustee, until such Advances shall have been repaid in full, together with all interest accrued thereon, prior to reimbursement of the Master Servicer for such Advances.  The Trustee shall be entitled to conclusively rely on any notice given with respect to a Nonrecoverable Advance or any determination of nonrecoverability in connection therewith by the Master Servicer hereunder.







 Section 7.07     Termination of the Operating Advisor.  (a)  An "Operating Advisor Termination Event" means any one of the following events whether any such event shall be voluntary or involuntary or be effected by operation of law or pursuant to any judgment, decree or order of any court or any order, rule or regulation of any administrative or governmental body:



 (i)       any failure by the Operating Advisor to observe or perform in any material respect any of its covenants or agreements or the material breach of its representations or warranties under this Agreement, which failure shall continue unremedied for a period of 30 days after the date on which written notice of such failure shall have been given to the Operating Advisor by any party hereto or to the Operating Advisor, the Certificate Administrator and the Trustee by the Holders of Certificates having greater than 25% of the aggregate Voting Rights; provided, that with respect to any such failure which is not curable within such 30-day period, the Operating Advisor shall have an additional cure period of thirty (30) days to effect such cure so long as it has commenced to cure such failure within the initial 30-day period and has provided the Trustee and the Certificate Administrator with an Officer's Certificate certifying that it has diligently pursued, and is continuing to pursue, such cure;



 (ii)       any failure by the Operating Advisor to perform in accordance with the Operating Advisor Standard which failure shall continue unremedied for a period of 30 days;



 (iii)       any failure by the Operating Advisor to be an Eligible Operating Advisor, which failure shall continue unremedied for a period of 30 days;



 (iv)       a decree or order of a court or agency or supervisory authority having jurisdiction in the premises in an involuntary case under any present or future federal or state bankruptcy, insolvency or similar law for the appointment of a conservator or receiver or liquidator in any insolvency, readjustment of debt, marshaling of assets and liabilities or similar proceedings, or for the winding-up or liquidation of its affairs, shall have been entered against the Operating Advisor, and such decree or order shall have remained in force undischarged or unstayed for a period of 60 days;



 (v)       the Operating Advisor shall consent to the appointment of a conservator or receiver or liquidator or liquidation committee in any insolvency, readjustment of debt, marshaling of assets and liabilities, voluntary liquidation, or similar proceedings of or relating to the Operating Advisor or of or relating to all or substantially all of its property; or



 (vi)       the Operating Advisor shall admit in writing its inability to pay its debts generally as they become due, file a petition to take advantage of any applicable insolvency or reorganization statute, make an assignment for the benefit of its creditors, or voluntarily suspend payment of its obligations.



 Upon receipt by the Certificate Administrator of notice of the occurrence of any Operating Advisor Termination Event, the Certificate Administrator shall promptly provide written notice to all Certificateholders by posting such notice on the Certificate Administrator's Website and by mail, unless the Certificate Administrator has received notice that it has been







 remedied. If an Operating Advisor Termination Event has occurred then, and in each and every such case, so long as such Operating Advisor Termination Event shall not have been remedied, either (i) the Trustee may or (ii) upon the written direction of holders of Certificates evidencing not less than 25% of the Voting Rights of each Class of Regular Certificates, the Trustee shall, terminate all of the rights and obligations of the Operating Advisor under this Agreement, other than rights and obligations accrued prior to such termination, including the right to receive all amounts accrued and owing to it under this Agreement, and other than indemnification rights (arising out of events occurring prior to such termination), by notice in writing to the Operating Advisor.  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Depositor shall have the right, but not the obligation, to notify the Certificate Administrator and the Trustee of any Operating Advisor Termination Event of which the Depositor has actual knowledge.



 (b)           Upon (i) the written direction of holders of Certificates evidencing not less than 15% of the aggregate Voting Rights requesting a vote to terminate and replace the Operating Advisor with a proposed successor Operating Advisor that is an Eligible Operating Advisor and (ii) payment by such Holders to the Certificate Administrator of the reasonable fees and expenses to be incurred by the Certificate Administrator in connection with administering such vote, the Certificate Administrator shall promptly provide written notice thereof to the Operating Advisor and to all Certificateholders by (i) posting such notice on the Certificate Administrator's Website and (ii) mail at their addresses appearing in the Certificate Register.  Upon the written direction of Holders of Certificates evidencing more than 50% of the Voting Rights that exercise their right to vote (provided that Holders of at least 50% of the Voting Rights exercise their right to vote), the Trustee shall terminate all of the rights and obligations of the Operating Advisor with respect to the Mortgage Loans under this Agreement by notice in writing to the Operating Advisor, other than rights and obligations accrued prior to such termination including the right to receive all amounts accrued and owing to it under this Agreement and other than indemnification rights arising out of events occurring prior to such termination.  The provisions set forth in the foregoing sentences of this Section 7.07(b) shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of solely the Certificateholders and the Trustee as between each other.  The Operating Advisor shall not have any cause of action based upon or arising from any breach or alleged breach of such provisions other than may arise, as a result of the failure to comply with the above described voting procedures.  As between the Operating Advisor, on the one hand, and the Certificateholders, on the other, the Certificateholders shall be entitled in their sole discretion to vote for the termination or not vote for the termination of the Operating Advisor.  The Certificate Administrator shall include on each Distribution Date Statement a statement that each Certificateholder and Beneficial Owner may access notices on the Certificate Administrator's Website and each Certificateholder and Beneficial Owner may register to receive email notifications when such notices are posted on the Certificate Administrator's Website; provided that the Certificate Administrator shall be entitled to reimbursement from the requesting Certificateholders for the reasonable expenses of posting such notices.



 (c)           On or after the receipt by the Operating Advisor of such written notice of termination, subject to the foregoing, all of its authority and power under this Agreement shall be terminated and, without limitation, the terminated Operating Advisor shall execute any and all documents and other instruments, and do or accomplish all other acts or things reasonably necessary or appropriate to effect the purposes of such notice of termination.  As soon as practicable, but in no event later than 15 Business Days after (1) the Operating Advisor resigns







 pursuant to Section 6.04(a) of this Agreement or (2) the Certificate Administrator delivers such written notice of termination to the Operating Advisor, the Trustee shall upon the written direction of Holders of Certificates evidencing not less than 25% of the Voting Rights of each Class of Regular Certificates of each Class of Certificates appoint a successor Operating Advisor that is an Eligible Operating Advisor, which successor Operating Advisor may be an Affiliate of the Trustee and shall be the proposed Operating Advisor in the case of a termination pursuant to Section 7.07(b) of this Agreement; provided, that if the Trustee is acting as the successor Master Servicer or successor Special Servicer, neither the Trustee nor any of its Affiliates shall be the successor Operating Advisor.  The Trustee shall provide written notice of the appointment of a successor Operating Advisor to the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Certificate Administrator, the Controlling Class Representative, each Serviced Companion Loan Noteholder and each Certificateholder within one Business Day of such appointment.  The Operating Advisor shall not at any time be the Depositor, the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, a Mortgage Loan Seller, an Other Depositor, an Other Servicer, an Other Special Servicer or an Affiliate of any of them.  If any of such entities becomes the Operating Advisor, including by means of an Affiliation arising after the date hereof, the Operating Advisor shall immediately resign or cause an assignment under Section 6.04 of this Agreement and the Trustee shall upon the written direction of Holders of Certificates evidencing not less than 25% of the Voting Rights of each Class of Certificates appoint a successor Operating Advisor subject to and in accordance with this Section 7.07(c), which successor Operating Advisor may be an Affiliate of the Trustee.



 (d)           Upon any termination of the Operating Advisor and appointment of a successor to the Operating Advisor, the Trustee shall, as soon as possible, give written notice thereof to the Special Servicer, the Master Servicer, the Certificate Administrator, the Depositor, the Certificateholders, any Serviced Companion Loan Noteholder and, if no Consultation Termination Event has occurred and is continuing, the Controlling Class Representative and the 17g-5 Information Provider (who shall promptly post such notice to the 17g-5 Information Provider's Website pursuant to Section 3.14(d) of this Agreement).  If the Operating Advisor is terminated, all of its rights and obligations under this Agreement shall terminate, other than any rights or obligations that accrued prior to the date of such termination (including the right to receive all amounts accrued and owing to it under this Agreement) and other than indemnification rights (arising out of events occurring prior to such termination).



 (e)           If there are no Classes of Certificates outstanding other than the Control Eligible Certificates, Class V Certificates and the Class R Certificates, then all of the rights and obligations of the Operating Advisor under this Agreement shall terminate without payment of any termination fee (other than any rights or obligations that accrued prior to the date of such termination (including accrued and unpaid compensation) and other than indemnification rights arising out of events occurring prior to such termination).  If the Operating Advisor is terminated pursuant to this Section 7.07(e), then no replacement Operating Advisor shall be appointed.  The Trustee shall provide the Operating Advisor with prompt notice upon its termination pursuant to this Section 7.07(e).

 liabilities which may be incurred therein or thereby, provided that nothing contained herein shall relieve the Trustee or the Certificate Administrator, as the case may be, of the obligations, upon the occurrence of a Servicer Termination Event (which has not been cured or waived) of which a Responsible Officer of the Trustee or the Certificate Administrator, as the case may be, has actual knowledge, to exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it by this Agreement, and to use the same degree of care and skill in their exercise, as a prudent person would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of such person's own affairs; and (B) the right of the Trustee and the Certificate Administrator to perform any discretionary act enumerated in this Agreement shall not be construed as a duty, and the Trustee or the Certificate Administrator, as the case may be, shall not be answerable for other than its own negligence or willful misconduct or bad faith in the performance of any such act;

Without limiting the foregoing, neither the Trustee nor the Certificate Administrator shall be liable or responsible for:  (i) the existence, condition and ownership of any Mortgaged Property; (ii) the existence of any hazard or other insurance thereon (other than if the Trustee shall assume the duties of the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer pursuant to Section 7.02 of this Agreement) or the enforceability thereof; (iii) the existence of any Mortgage Loan or the contents of the related Mortgage File on any computer or other record thereof (other than if the Trustee shall assume the duties of the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer pursuant to Section 7.02 of this Agreement); (iv) the validity of the assignment of any Mortgage Loan to the Trust Fund or of any intervening assignment; (v) the completeness of any Mortgage File; the performance or enforcement of any Mortgage Loan (other than if the Trustee shall assume the duties of the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer pursuant to Section 7.02 of this Agreement); (vi) the compliance by the Depositor, the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer or the Operating Advisor with any warranty or representation made under this Agreement or in any related document or the accuracy of any such warranty or representation prior to the Trustee's receipt of written notice or other discovery of any non-compliance therewith or any breach thereof; (vii) any investment of monies by or at the direction of the Master Servicer or any loss resulting therefrom, the acts or omissions of any of the Depositor, the Certificate Administrator, the Operating Advisor, the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer (other than if the Trustee shall assume the duties of the Certificate Administrator, the Master Servicer or Special Servicer pursuant to Section 7.02 of this Agreement) or any sub-servicer or any Borrower; any action of the Master Servicer or Special Servicer (other than if the Trustee shall assume the duties of the Master Servicer or Special Servicer pursuant to Section 7.02 of this Agreement) or any sub-servicer taken in the name of the Trustee, except to the extent such action is taken at the express written direction of the Trustee; (viii) the failure of the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer or any sub-servicer to act or perform any duties required of them on behalf of the Trust Fund or the Trustee hereunder; or (ix) any action by or omission of the Trustee or the Certificate Administrator taken at the instruction of the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer (other than if the Trustee shall assume the duties of the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer pursuant to Section 7.02 of this Agreement) unless the taking of such action is not permitted by the express terms of this Agreement; provided, that the foregoing shall not relieve the Trustee or the Certificate Administrator of their respective obligations to perform their duties as specifically set forth in this Agreement.

Neither the Trustee nor the Certificate Administrator shall have any responsibility for filing any financing or continuation statement in any public office at any time or to otherwise perfect or maintain the perfection of any security interest or lien granted to it hereunder (unless the Trustee shall have become the successor Master Servicer) or to record this Agreement.  In making any calculation hereunder which includes as a component thereof the payment or distribution of interest for a stated period at a stated rate "to the extent permitted by applicable law," the Trustee or the Certificate Administrator, as the case may be, shall assume that such payment is so permitted unless a Responsible Officer of the Trustee or the Certificate Administrator, as the case may be, has actual knowledge, or receives an Opinion of Counsel (at the expense of the Person asserting the impermissibility) to the effect, that such payment is not permitted by applicable law.  The Depositor is not obligated to monitor or supervise the performance of the Trustee or the Certificate Administrator under this Agreement or otherwise.

(a)  On each Distribution Date, prior to the distribution of amounts to the Certificateholders, the Certificate Administrator shall be entitled to withdraw and pay the Trustee and itself its respective portion of the Trustee/Certificate Administrator Fee, as reasonable compensation from amounts remitted to the Lower-Tier Distribution Account for all services rendered in the execution of the trusts hereby created and in the exercise and performance of any of the powers and duties of the Trustee and the Certificate Administrator at the Trustee/Certificate Administrator Fee Rate.



 (b)           If the Trustee assumes the servicing responsibilities of the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer hereunder pursuant to or otherwise arising from the resignation or removal of the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, the Trustee shall be entitled to the compensation to which the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as the case may be, would have been entitled (other than the rights of the Special Servicer to receive any Workout Fee specified in Section 3.12(c) of this Agreement if the Special Servicer is terminated).







 (c)           The Trustee, the Custodian and the Certificate Administrator shall be paid or reimbursed by the Trust Fund upon its request for all reasonable expenses, disbursements and advances incurred or made by the Trustee, the Custodian or the Certificate Administrator pursuant to and in accordance with any of the provisions of this Agreement (including the reasonable compensation and the expenses and disbursements of its counsel and of all persons not regularly in its employ), which the Certificate Administrator will be entitled to withdraw from the Distribution Accounts prior to the distribution to Certificateholders to the extent set forth herein and to the extent such payments are "unanticipated expenses incurred by the REMIC" within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.860G-1(b)(iii) except any such expense, disbursement or advance as may arise from its negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith; provided, that, subject to the last paragraph of Section 8.01 and Section 8.02(a)(iii) of this Agreement, the Trustee, the Custodian or the Certificate Administrator shall not refuse to perform any of their respective duties hereunder solely as a result of the failure to be paid their respective portion of the Trustee/Certificate Administrator Fee, or the Trustee's, Custodian's or Certificate Administrator's previously-incurred expenses, as applicable.  The term "unanticipated expenses incurred by the REMIC" shall include any fees, expenses and disbursement of any separate Trustee or co-Trustee appointed hereunder, only to the extent such fees, expenses and disbursements were not reasonably anticipated as of the Closing Date and are attributable to the Lower-Tier REMIC, the Upper-Tier REMIC and the losses, liabilities, damages, claims or expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred or advanced by an Indemnified Party in connection with any litigation arising out of this Agreement attributable to the Lower-Tier REMIC, the Upper-Tier REMIC or the Grantor Trust, including, without limitation, under Section 2.03, Section 3.10, the third paragraph of Section 3.11, Section 4.05 and Section 7.01 of this Agreement.

 (d)           Each of the Certificate Administrator, the Custodian, the Paying Agent, the Trustee, the Depositor, the Master Servicer and the Special Servicer (each, for purposes of this Section 8.05(d), an "Indemnifying Party") shall (severally and not jointly) indemnify the Trustee (both in its capacity as Trustee and individually) and the Certificate Administrator (in its capacity as Certificate Administrator, Custodian, Paying Agent and individually) and each of their Affiliates and each of the directors, officers, employees, representatives and agents of the Trustee and the Certificate Administrator and each of their Affiliates (each, for purposes of this Section 8.05(d), an "Indemnified Party"), and hold each of them harmless against any and all claims, losses, damages, penalties, fines, forfeitures, reasonable legal fees and related costs, judgments, and any other costs, fees and expenses that the Indemnified Party may sustain in connection with this Agreement (including, without limitation, reasonable fees and

The right of reimbursement of the Indemnified Parties under this Section 8.05(d) shall be senior to the rights of all Certificateholders.



 (e)           Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, this Section 8.05 shall survive the termination or maturity of this Agreement or the resignation, removal or termination of the Trustee or the Certificate Administrator, as the case may be, regarding rights accrued prior to such resignation, removal or termination and (with respect to any acts or omissions during its respective tenures) the resignation, removal or termination of the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Paying Agent, the Certificate Administrator, the Certificate Registrar or the Custodian.



 (f)           This Section 8.05 shall be expressly construed to include, but not be limited to, such indemnities, compensation, expenses, disbursements, advances, losses, liabilities, damages and the like, as may pertain or relate to any environmental law or environmental matter.



 (g)           Each of the Certificate Administrator, the Custodian, the Paying Agent and the Trustee (in each case with respect to itself only, for purposes of this Section 8.05(g), an "Indemnifying Party") shall (severally and not jointly) indemnify the Trust Fund, the Depositor, the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer and each other, and each of their respective Affiliates and each of the directors, officers, employees and agents of the Master Servicer and the Special Servicer and their respective Affiliates (each, for purposes of this Section 8.05(g), an "Indemnified Party"), and hold each of them harmless against any and all claims, losses, damages, penalties, fines, forfeitures, reasonable legal fees and related costs, judgments, and any other costs, fees and expenses that the Indemnified Party may sustain in connection with this Agreement (including, without limitation reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel incurred by the Indemnified Party in any action or proceeding between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party or between the Indemnified Party and any third party or otherwise) resulting from the applicable Indemnifying Party's willful misconduct, bad faith, fraud or negligence in







 the performance of its duties hereunder or by reason of negligent disregard of its obligations and duties hereunder.

 (vi)          not be a Prohibited Party.



 Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Trustee or the Certificate Administrator meets the provisions of clauses (i) through (iii), (v) and (vi) above, but does not meet the provisions of clause (iv) above, the Trustee or the Certificate Administrator, as the case may be,

If the place of business from which the Trustee administers the Trust Fund is a state or local jurisdiction that imposes a tax on the Trust Fund or the net income of either Trust REMIC (other than a tax corresponding to a tax imposed under the REMIC Provisions) the Trustee shall elect either to (i) resign immediately in the manner and with the effect specified in Section 8.07 of this Agreement, (ii) pay such tax and continue as Trustee or (iii) administer the Trust Fund from a state and local jurisdiction that does not impose such a tax.

Upon notice of resignation from the Trustee, the Depositor shall promptly appoint a successor trustee, the appointment of which is subject to the requirements contained in Section 8.06 of this Agreement and shall be, if no Control Termination Event has occurred and is continuing, reasonably acceptable to the initial Directing Holder (or, in the event that there is a successor Directing Holder that is not a Controlling Class Certificateholder as of the Closing Date, the Master Servicer, and otherwise, such successor Directing Holder).  Upon notice of resignation from the Certificate Administrator, the Trustee shall promptly appoint a successor certificate administrator, the appointment of which is subject to the requirements contained in Section 8.06 of this Agreement.

 or the Certificate Administrator, as the case may be (or of its property or affairs), for the purpose of rehabilitation, conservation or liquidation, then the Depositor or the Master Servicer may remove the Trustee or the Certificate Administrator, as the case may be, and the Depositor or the Master Servicer shall promptly appoint a successor by written instrument, which shall be delivered to the Trustee or the Certificate Administrator, as the case may be, so removed and to the successor.



 The Holders of Certificates entitled to at least 50% of the Voting Rights may at any time remove the Trustee or the Certificate Administrator and appoint a successor by written instrument or instruments, in eight originals, signed by such Holders or their attorneys-in-fact duly authorized, one complete set of which instruments shall be delivered to each of the Depositor, the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Operating Advisor, the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator and the successor trustee or certificate administrator, as applicable.

 If the Certificate Administrator is terminated or removed pursuant to this Section 8.07, (i) all of its rights and obligations under this Agreement and in and to the Mortgage Loans shall be terminated, other than any rights or obligations that accrued prior to the date of such termination or removal (including the right to receive all fees, indemnities, expenses and other amounts accrued or owing to it under this Agreement with respect to periods prior to the date of such termination or removal) and (ii) such resignation, termination, or removal shall be effective with respect to each of its other capacities hereunder except its capacity as Custodian (but including, without limitation, its capacities as Certificate Registrar, 17g-5 Information Provider, Paying Agent and Authenticating Agent).



 Upon the resignation, assignment, or transfer of the Trustee or its business to a successor, or upon the termination of the Trustee, (a) the outgoing Trustee, at its own expense without right to reimbursement therefor, shall (A) endorse the original executed Note for each Mortgage Loan (to the extent that the original executed Note for each Mortgage Loan was endorsed to the outgoing Trustee), without recourse, representation or warranty, express or implied, to the order of the successor, as trustee for the registered holders of COMM 2013-CCRE12 Mortgage Trust Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, or in blank, and (B) in the case of the other assignable Loan Documents (to the extent such other Loan Documents were assigned to the outgoing Trustee), assign and record such Loan Documents to such successor, and such successor shall review the documents delivered to it or to the Custodian with respect to each Mortgage Loan, and certify in writing that, as to each Mortgage Loan then







 subject to this Agreement, such endorsement and assignment has been made; (b) if any original executed Note for a Mortgage Loan was not endorsed to the outgoing Trustee, the Custodian shall deliver such Note to the successor trustee and the Custodian shall cooperate with any successor trustee to ensure that such Note is endorsed (without recourse, representation or warranty, express or implied) to the order of the successor trustee, as trustee for the registered holders of COMM 2013-CCRE12 Mortgage Trust Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, or in blank.  If any assignable Loan Document (other than the Note) was not assigned to the outgoing Trustee or if the Trustee is removed pursuant to Section 8.07 without cause, with respect to the Loan Documents identified in clause (B) of the preceding sentence, the Custodian shall deliver such Loan Document to the successor trustee and, if appropriate, such Loan Documents shall be recorded at the expense of the Trust (i) prior to the occurrence and continuance of a Control Termination Event, with the consent of the Controlling Class Representative, (ii) after the occurrence and continuance of a Control Termination Event but prior to the occurrence and continuance of a Consultation Termination Event, after consultation with the Controlling Class Representative and the Operating Advisor and (iii) after the occurrence and continuance of a Consultation Termination Event, after consultation with the Operating Advisor and the reasonable cooperation (as determined by the Depositor) of the Depositor.

The predecessor Trustee or Certificate Administrator, as applicable, shall deliver to its successor all Mortgage Files and related documents and statements held by it hereunder, and the Depositor and the predecessor Trustee or Certificate Administrator, as applicable, shall execute and deliver such instruments and do such other things as may reasonably be required for more fully and certainly vesting and confirming in the successor all such rights, powers, duties and obligations.  No successor trustee or certificate administrator, as the case may be, shall accept appointment as provided in this Section 8.08 unless at the time of such acceptance such successor shall be eligible under the provisions of Section 8.06 of this Agreement.



 Upon acceptance of appointment by a successor trustee as provided in this Section 8.08, the Depositor shall mail notice of the succession of such Trustee hereunder to all Holders of Certificates at their addresses as shown in the Certificate Register.  If the Depositor fails to mail such notice within 10 days after acceptance of appointment by the successor trustee, the successor trustee shall cause such notice to be mailed at the expense of the Depositor.



 (b)           Any successor trustee appointed pursuant to this Agreement shall satisfy the eligibility requirements set forth in Section 8.06 hereof.







 Section 8.09     Merger or Consolidation of Trustee or Certificate Administrator.  Any corporation into which the Trustee or the Certificate Administrator may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated or any corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which the Trustee or the Certificate Administrator shall be a party, or any corporation succeeding to all or substantially all of the corporate trust business of the Trustee or the Certificate Administrator, shall be the successor of the Trustee or the Certificate Administrator, as the case may be, hereunder; provided that such corporation shall be eligible under the provisions of Section 8.06 of this Agreement without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of any of the parties hereto, anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding.  The Trustee or the Certificate Administrator, as applicable, shall notify the other parties hereto of any such event, and the Certificate Administrator shall post notice of such merger or consolidation to the Certificate Administrator's Website in accordance with Section 3.14(d) of this Agreement and provide notice of such event to the 17g-5 Information Provider (who shall promptly post such notice to the 17g-5 Information Provider's Website pursuant to Section 3.14(d) of this Agreement).



 Section 8.10     Appointment of Co-Trustee or Separate Trustee.  Notwithstanding any other provisions hereof, at any time, for the purpose of meeting any legal requirements of any jurisdiction in which any part of the Trust Fund or property securing the same may at the time be located, the Depositor and the Trustee acting jointly shall have the power and shall execute and deliver all instruments to appoint one or more Persons approved by the Trustee to act (at the expense of the Trust) as co-Trustee or co-Trustees, jointly with the Trustee, or separate Trustee or separate Trustees, of all or any part of the Trust Fund, and to vest in such Person or Persons, in such capacity, such title to the Trust Fund, or any part thereof, and, subject to the other provisions of this Section 8.10, such powers, duties, obligations, rights and trusts as the Depositor and the Trustee may consider necessary or desirable.  If the Depositor shall not have joined in such appointment within 15 days after the receipt by it of a request so to do, or in case a Servicer Termination Event shall have occurred and be continuing, the Trustee alone shall have the power to make such appointment.  Except as required by applicable law, the appointment of a co-Trustee or separate Trustee shall not relieve the Trustee of its responsibilities, obligations and liabilities hereunder.  No co-Trustee or separate Trustee hereunder shall be required to meet the terms of eligibility as a successor Trustee under Section 8.06 hereunder and no notice to Holders of Certificates of the appointment of co-Trustee(s) or separate Trustee(s) shall be required under Section 8.08 hereof.



 In the case of any appointment of a co-Trustee or separate Trustee pursuant to this Section 8.10, all rights, powers, duties and obligations conferred or imposed upon the Trustee shall be conferred or imposed upon and exercised or performed by the Trustee and such separate Trustee or co-Trustee jointly (it being understood that such separate Trustee or co-Trustee is not authorized to act separately without the Trustee joining in such act), except to the extent that under any law of any jurisdiction in which any particular act or acts are to be performed (whether as Trustee hereunder or as successor to the Master Servicer hereunder), the Trustee shall be incompetent or unqualified to perform such act or acts, in which event such rights, powers, duties and obligations (including the holding of title to the Trust Fund or any portion thereof in any such jurisdiction) shall be exercised and performed by such separate Trustee or co-Trustee solely at the direction of the Trustee.







 No Trustee under this Agreement shall be personally liable by reason of any act or omission of any other trustee under this Agreement.  The Depositor and the Trustee acting jointly may at any time accept the resignation of or remove any separate Trustee or co-Trustee, or if the separate Trustee or co-Trustee is an employee of the Trustee, the Trustee acting alone may accept the resignation of or remove any separate Trustee or co-Trustee.



 Any notice, request or other writing given to the Trustee shall be deemed to have been given to each of the then separate Trustees and co-Trustees, as effectively as if given to each of them.  Every instrument appointing any separate Trustee or co-Trustee shall refer to this Agreement and the conditions of this Article VIII.  Every such instrument shall be filed with the Trustee.  Each separate Trustee and co-Trustee, upon its acceptance of the trusts conferred, shall be vested with the estates or property specified in its instrument of appointment, either jointly with the Trustee or separately, as may be provided therein, subject to all the provisions of this Agreement, specifically including every provision of this Agreement relating to the conduct of, affecting the liability of, or affording protection to, the Trustee.  In no event shall any such separate Trustee or co-Trustee be entitled to any provision relating to the conduct of, affecting the liability of or affording protection to such separate Trustee or co-Trustee that imposes a standard of conduct less stringent than that imposed by the Trustee hereunder, affording greater protection than that afforded to the Trustee hereunder or providing a greater limit on liability than that provided to the Trustee hereunder.



 Any separate Trustee or co-Trustee may, at any time, constitute the Trustee its agent or attorney-in-fact, with full power and authority, to the extent not prohibited by law, to do any lawful act under or in respect of this Agreement on its behalf and in its name.  If any separate Trustee or co-Trustee shall die, become incapable of acting, resign or be removed, all of its estates, properties, rights, remedies and trusts shall vest in and be exercised by the Trustee, to the extent permitted by law, without the appointment of a new or successor Trustee.

 (b)           The Trust Fund, the Lower-Tier REMIC and the Upper-Tier REMIC shall be terminated and the assets of the Trust Fund shall be sold or otherwise disposed of in connection therewith, only pursuant to a "plan of complete liquidation" within the meaning of Section 860F(a)(4)(A) of the Code providing for the actions contemplated by the provisions hereof and pursuant to which the applicable Notice of Termination is given, and requiring that the Trust Fund, the Lower-Tier REMIC and the Upper-Tier REMIC shall terminate on a Distribution Date occurring not more than 90 days following the date of adoption of the plan of complete liquidation.

Notwithstanding the termination of the Lower-Tier REMIC or the Upper-Tier REMIC or the Trust Fund, the Certificate Administrator shall be responsible for filing the final Tax Returns for each such REMIC and for the Grantor Trust for the period ending with such termination, and shall retain books and records with respect to such REMICs and the Grantor Trust for the same period of retention for which it maintains its own tax returns or such other reasonable period.  The Trustee shall sign all Tax Returns and other reports required by this Section.



 (c)           The Certificateholder owning a majority of the Percentage Interests in the Controlling Class and, if no such Certificateholder exercises such option, the Special Servicer, and if the Special Servicer does not exercise such option, the Master Servicer may effect an early termination of the Trust Fund, upon not less than 30 days' prior Notice of Termination given to the Trustee, the Special Servicer and the Master Servicer any time on or after the Early Termination Notice Date specifying the Anticipated Termination Date, by purchasing on such date all, but not less than all, of the Mortgage Loans then included in the Trust Fund, and the Trust's interest in all property acquired in respect of any Mortgage Loan, at a purchase price, payable in cash, equal to the sum of, without duplication:



 (i)           100% of the Stated Principal Balance of each Mortgage Loan included in the Trust Fund as of the last day of the month preceding such Anticipated Termination Date (less any P&I Advances previously made on account of principal);



 (ii)           the fair market value of all other property included in the Trust Fund as of the last day of the month preceding such Anticipated Termination Date, as determined by an Independent appraiser acceptable to the Master Servicer as of a date not more than 30 days prior to the last day of the month preceding such Distribution Date;







 (iii)          all unpaid interest accrued on the unpaid balance of each Mortgage Loan (including any Mortgage Loan as to which title to the related Mortgaged Property has been acquired) at the Mortgage Rate to the last day of the month preceding such Anticipated Termination Date (less any P&I Advances previously made on account of interest); and



 (iv)          the aggregate amount of unreimbursed Advances, with interest thereon at the Advance Rate, and unpaid Servicing Compensation, Special Servicing Compensation, Operating Advisor Fees, Trustee/Certificate Administrator Fees, the CREFC® License Fees and Trust Fund expenses.



 If the Certificateholder owning a majority of the Percentage Interests in the Controlling Class, the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer purchases all of the Mortgage Loans and all property acquired in respect of any Mortgage Loan remaining in the Trust Fund in accordance with this Section 9.01(c), the Certificateholder owning a majority of the Percentage Interests in the Controlling Class, the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as applicable, shall deposit in the Lower-Tier Distribution Account not later than the Servicer Remittance Date relating to the Anticipated Termination Date on which the final distribution on the Certificates is to occur, an amount in immediately available funds equal to the above-described purchase price (exclusive of any portion thereof payable to any Person other than the Certificateholders pursuant to Section 3.05(a) of this Agreement, which portion shall be deposited in the Collection Account).  In addition, the Master Servicer shall transfer to the Certificate Administrator for deposit in the Lower-Tier Distribution Account all amounts required to be transferred thereto on the Servicer Remittance Date from the Collection Account, together with any other amounts on deposit in the Collection Account that would otherwise be held for future distribution.  Upon confirmation by the Master Servicer in writing that it has transferred all such amounts to the Certificate Administrator, the Custodian shall release or cause to be released to the Certificateholder owning a majority of the Percentage Interests in the Controlling Class, the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as applicable, the Mortgage Files for the remaining Mortgage Loans and shall execute all assignments, endorsements and other instruments furnished to it by such purchasing party as shall be necessary to effectuate transfer of the Mortgage Loans and all property acquired in respect of any Mortgage Loan remaining in the Trust Fund, and the Trust Fund shall be liquidated in accordance with this Article IX.



 For purposes of this Section 9.01, the Directing Holder with the consent of the Holders of the Controlling Class, shall act on behalf of the Holders of the Controlling Class in purchasing the assets of the Trust Fund and terminating the Trust.



 As a condition to the purchase of the assets of the Trust Fund pursuant to this Section 9.01(c), the purchaser shall deliver to the Trustee and the Certificate Administrator an Opinion of Counsel, which shall be at the expense of such purchaser, stating that such termination will be a "qualified liquidation" under Section 860F(a)(4)(A) of the Code.  All costs and expenses incurred by any and all parties to this Agreement or by the Trust Fund in connection with the purchase of the Mortgage Loans and other assets of the Trust Fund pursuant to this Section 9.01(c) shall be borne by the party exercising its purchase rights hereunder.  The Trustee and the Certificate Administrator shall be entitled to rely conclusively on any determination made by an Independent appraiser pursuant to this subsection (c).







 (d)           If the Trust Fund has not been previously terminated pursuant to subsection (c) of this Section 9.01, the Certificate Administrator shall determine as soon as practicable the Distribution Date on which the Certificate Administrator reasonably anticipates, based on information with respect to the Mortgage Loans previously provided to it, that the final distribution will be made to the Holders of outstanding Regular Certificates, notwithstanding that such distribution may be insufficient to distribute in full the Certificate Balance of each Class of Certificates, together with amounts required to be distributed on such Distribution Date pursuant to Section 4.01(b) of this Agreement; provided, that, if no such Classes of Certificates are then outstanding, the final distribution shall be made (i) to the Holders of the Class LR Certificates of any amount remaining in the Collection Accounts or the Lower-Tier Distribution Account, and (ii) to the Holders of the Class R Certificates of any amount remaining in the Upper-Tier Distribution Account.



 (e)           Notice of any termination of the Trust Fund pursuant to this Section 9.01 shall be mailed by the Certificate Administrator to Certificateholders (with a copy to the Trustee, the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Mortgage Loan Sellers, the Operating Advisor, the related Serviced Companion Loan Noteholder (if any) and the 17g-5 Information Provider (who shall promptly post such notice to the 17g-5 Information Provider's Website pursuant to Section 3.14(d) of this Agreement)), at their addresses shown in the Certificate Registrar not more than 30 days, and not less than ten days, prior to the Anticipated Termination Date.  The notice mailed by the Certificate Administrator to Certificateholders shall:



 (i)            specify the Anticipated Termination Date on which the final distribution is anticipated to be made to Holders of Certificates of the Classes specified therein;



 (ii)           specify the amount of any such final distribution, if known; and



 (iii)          state that the final distribution to Certificateholders will be made only upon presentation and surrender of Certificates at the office of the Paying Agent therein specified.



 If the Trust Fund is not terminated on any Anticipated Termination Date for any reason, the Certificate Administrator shall promptly mail notice thereof to each Certificateholder.



 (f)           Any funds not distributed on the Termination Date because of the failure of any Certificateholders to tender their Certificates shall be set aside and held in trust for the account of the appropriate non-tendering Certificateholders, whereupon the Trust Fund shall terminate.  If any Certificates as to which notice of the Termination Date has been given pursuant to this Section 9.01 shall not have been surrendered for cancellation within six months after the time specified in such notice, the Certificate Administrator shall mail a second notice to the remaining Certificateholders, at their last addresses shown in the Certificate Register, to surrender their Certificates for cancellation in order to receive, from such funds held, the final distribution with respect thereto.  If within one year after the second notice any Certificate shall not have been surrendered for cancellation, the Certificate Administrator may, directly or through an agent, take appropriate steps to contact the remaining Certificateholders concerning surrender of their Certificates.  The costs and expenses of maintaining such funds and of contacting Certificateholders shall be paid out of the assets which remain held.  If within two years after the second notice any Certificates shall not have been surrendered for cancellation,







 the Paying Agent shall pay to the Certificate Administrator all amounts distributable to the Holders thereof, and the Certificate Administrator shall thereafter hold such amounts for the benefit of such Holders until the earlier of (i) its termination as Certificate Administrator hereunder and the transfer of such amounts to a successor certificate administrator and (ii) the termination of the Trust Fund and distribution of such amounts to the Residual Certificateholders.  No interest shall accrue or be payable to any Certificateholder on any amount held as a result of such Certificateholder's failure to surrender its Certificate(s) for final payment thereof in accordance with this Section 9.01.  Any amounts remaining in the Class V Distribution Account representing Excess Interest shall be distributed to the Holders of the Class V Certificates.



 (g)           Following the date on which the Class X-A Notional Amount and the aggregate Certificate Balance of the Class A-1, Class A-2, Class A-3, Class A-4, Class A-SB, Class A-M, Class B, Class PEZ, Class C and Class D Certificates is reduced to zero, the Sole Certificateholder shall have the right to exchange all of the then-outstanding Certificates (other than (i) the Class X-C Certificates if the Sole Certificateholder has only taken an assignment of the Voting Rights of the Class X-C Certificates pursuant to the definition of "Sole Certificateholder" and (ii) the Class V, Class R and Class LR Certificates) for all of the Mortgage Loans and each REO Property remaining in the Trust Fund as contemplated by clause (ii) of Section 9.01(a) by giving written notice to all the parties hereto no later than 60 days prior to the anticipated date of exchange; provided that such Sole Certificateholder pays to the Certificate Administrator as additional compensation an amount equal to one day of interest calculated at the Prime Rate on the aggregate Certificate Balance of the Sequential Pay Certificates as of the first day of the current calendar month and such Sole Certificateholder pays to the Master Servicer as additional compensation an amount equal to (i) the product of (A) the Prime Rate, (B) the aggregate Certificate Balance of the then-outstanding Sequential Pay Certificates as of the day of the exchange and (C) three, divided by (ii) 360, and such payments shall be treated as made by the Sole Certificateholder directly to the Certificate Administrator and the Master Servicer and not through or by either of the Trust REMICs; provided, further, that if the Holders of the Class X-C Certificate have assigned their Voting Rights to the "Sole Certificateholder", then the Sole Certificateholder may exchange the Class E, Class F and Class G Certificates for all of the Mortgage Loans and each REO Property remaining in the Trust Fund as contemplated by clause (ii) of Section 9.01(a), and the Holders of the Class X-C Certificates shall be entitled to exchange those Certificates for consideration in an amount to be agreed by the Sole Certificateholder and the Holders of the Class X-C Certificates (the "Class X-C Payoff Amount"); provided, that the Class X-C Payoff Amount shall consist solely of cash or other assets otherwise payable or deliverable by the Trust to the Sole Certificateholder and to no other Person.  If the Sole Certificateholder elects to exchange all of the then-outstanding Certificates (other than (i) the Class X-C Certificates if the Sole Certificateholder has only taken an assignment of the Voting Rights of the Class X-C Certificates pursuant to the definition of "Sole Certificateholder" and (ii) the Class V, Class R and Class LR Certificates) for all of the Mortgage Loans and each REO Property remaining in the Trust Fund in accordance with the preceding sentence, such Sole Certificateholder, not later than the Distribution Date on which the final distribution on the Certificates is to occur, shall deposit in the Collection Account an amount in immediately available funds equal to all amounts due and owing to the Depositor, the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Certificate Administrator, the Operating Advisor and the Trustee hereunder through the date of the liquidation of the Trust Fund that may be







 withdrawn from the Collection Account, or an escrow account acceptable to the respective parties hereto, pursuant to Section 3.06(a) of this Agreement or that may be withdrawn from the Distribution Accounts pursuant to Section 3.06(f) and Section 3.06(g) of this Agreement, but only to the extent that such amounts are not already on deposit in the Collection Account.  In addition, the Master Servicer shall transfer all amounts required to be transferred to the Certificate Administrator for deposit in the Lower-Tier Distribution Account on such Servicer Remittance Date from the Collection Account pursuant to Section 3.05 of this Agreement.  Upon confirmation from the Certificate Administrator that such final deposits have been made and following the surrender of all the then-outstanding Certificates (other than (i) the Class X-C Certificates if the Sole Certificateholder has only taken an assignment of the Voting Rights of the Class X-C Certificates pursuant to the definition of "Sole Certificateholder" and (ii) the Class V, Class R and Class LR Certificates) on the final Distribution Date to the Certificate Administrator, the Custodian shall (i) upon receipt of a Request for Release from the Master Servicer, release to the Sole Certificateholder or any designee thereof, the Mortgage Files for the remaining Mortgage Loans and shall execute all assignments, endorsements and other instruments furnished to it by the Sole Certificateholder as shall be necessary to effectuate transfer of the Mortgage Loans and REO Properties remaining in the Trust Fund and (ii) if the Sole Certificateholder has only taken an assignment of the Voting Rights of the Class X-C Certificates pursuant to the definition of "Sole Certificateholder", upon receipt of the Class X-C Certificates, release the Class X-C Payoff Amount to the Holders of the Class X-C Certificates, and the Trust Fund shall be liquidated in accordance with this Article IX; provided, that the release of the Class X-C Payoff Amount to the Holders of the Class X-C Certificates shall be deemed to be delivery of the Class X-C Payoff Amount by the Trust to the Sole Certificateholder and by the Sole Certificateholder to the Holders of the Class X-C Certificates.  The remaining Mortgage Loans and REO Properties are deemed distributed to the Sole Certificateholder in liquidation of the Trust Fund pursuant to this Article IX.  Solely for federal income tax purposes, the Sole Certificateholder shall be deemed to have purchased the assets of the Lower-Tier REMIC for an amount equal to the remaining Certificate Balance of its Certificates (other than the Class V, Class R and Class LR Certificates), plus accrued, unpaid interest with respect thereto, and the Certificate Administrator shall credit such amounts against amounts distributable in respect of the Lower-Tier Regular Interests and such Certificates.



 (h)           The duties of the Operating Advisor under this Agreement will terminate, without cost or expense to the Operating Advisor, upon termination of the Issuing Entity.

Oral and written requests have been made on behalf of the registrant, to the extent required under the related pooling and servicing agreement, to obtain the information required for this [Item 6] [Item 1112(b)(1)], and the registrant has been unable to obtain such information to include on this [Form 10-D] [Form 10-K] by the related filing deadline.  The information is therefore being omitted herefrom in reliance on Rule 12b-21 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended" or such other statement as directed by the Depositor.



 (c)           With respect to any Mortgaged Property that secures a Serviced Companion Loan that the Other Depositor has notified the Master Servicer in writing is a "significant obligor" (within the meaning of Item 1101(k) of Regulation AB) with respect to an Other Securitization that includes such Serviced Companion Loan, the Master Servicer shall, after receipt of updated net operating income information, (x) promptly deliver the financial statements of such "significant obligor" to the Other Depositor and Other Trustee of such Other Securitization and (y) update the columns of the CREFC® Loan Periodic Update File for (i) the next applicable Distribution Date if the Master Servicer receives such updated net operating income information at least ten Business Days prior to the Determination Date related to such Distribution Date or (ii) the second succeeding Distribution Date if the Master Servicer does not receive such updated net operating income information prior to the date set forth in clause (i) related to such "significant obligor" as described in the last sentence of the first paragraph of this clause (c).

The Master Servicer shall use efforts consistent with the Servicing Standard (taking into account, in addition, the ongoing reporting obligations of such Other Depositor under the Exchange Act) to obtain the periodic financial statements of the related Borrower under the related Loan Documents.



 The Master Servicer shall (or shall cause a Sub-Servicer to) retain written evidence of each instance in which it (or a Sub-Servicer) attempts to contact the borrower related to such "significant obligor" to obtain the required financial information and is unsuccessful and, within five (5) Business Days prior to the date in which a Form 10-D or Form 10-K, as applicable, is required to be filed by the Other Securitization, shall forward an Officer's Certificate evidencing its attempts to obtain this information to the certificate administrator and Other Depositor related to such Other Securitization.

 expense, damage, claim arising out of or with respect to any failure to properly prepare and/or timely file any such Form 12b-25 or any amendments to Forms 8-K, Form 10-D or Form 10-K, where such failure results from the Certificate Administrator's inability or failure to receive, on a timely basis, any information from any other party hereto needed to prepare, arrange for execution or file such Form 12b-25 or any amendments to Form 8-K, Form 10-D or Form 10-K, not resulting from its own negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct.

 The Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Operating Advisor, the Certificate Administrator and the Trustee shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause each Servicing Function Participant (other than (x) any party to this Agreement or (y) a Mortgage Loan Seller Sub-Servicer) with which it has entered into a servicing relationship with respect to the Mortgage Loans (other than a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan) to indemnify and hold harmless each







 Certification Party from and against any losses, damages, penalties, fines, forfeitures, legal fees and expenses and related costs, judgments and other costs and expenses incurred by such Certification Party arising out of a breach of its obligations to provide any of the annual compliance statements or annual assessment of servicing criteria or attestation reports pursuant to this Agreement, or the applicable Sub-Servicing Agreement, as applicable.



 If the indemnification provided for herein is unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless any Certification Party, then the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Operating Advisor, the Certificate Administrator, the Trustee, each Additional Servicer or other Servicing Function Participant (the "Performing Party") shall, and the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Operating Advisor, the Certificate Administrator and the Trustee shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause each Servicing Function Participant with which it has entered into a servicing relationship (other than (x) a party to this Agreement or (y) any Mortgage Loan Seller Sub-Servicer) with respect to the Mortgage Loans (other than a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan) to contribute to the amount paid or payable to the Certification Party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities of the Certification Party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the Certification Party on the one hand and the Performing Party on the other in connection with a breach of the Performing Party's obligations pursuant to this Article X.  The Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Operating Advisor, the Certificate Administrator and the Trustee shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause each Servicing Function Participant (other than (x) any party to this Agreement or (y) Mortgage Loan Seller Sub-Servicers) with which it has entered into a servicing relationship with respect to the Mortgage Loans (other than a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan) to agree to the foregoing indemnification and contribution obligations.



 Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party hereunder, notify in writing the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof; but the omission to so notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party under this Agreement except to the extent that such omission to notify materially prejudices the indemnifying party.  In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party, after the indemnifying party has been notified of the commencement of such action, such indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein (at its own expense) and, to the extent that it may wish, shall be entitled to assume the defense thereof (jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified) with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), and after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election to so assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party for any expenses subsequently incurred in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation.  In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have agreed to the retention of such counsel, (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them or (iii) the indemnifying party fails within a reasonable period of time to designate counsel that is reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party







 (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).  In no event shall the indemnifying parties be liable for fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) in any one jurisdiction separate from their own counsel for all indemnified parties in connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances.

 (iv)         to amend or supplement a provision or effect any other change, in each case which will not adversely affect in any material respect the interests of any Certificateholder or Serviced Companion Loan Noteholder not consenting thereto, as evidenced in writing by an Opinion of Counsel or, if solely affecting any Certificateholder or Serviced Companion Loan Noteholder, in respect of which a No Downgrade Confirmation has been obtained relating to the Certificates of a rated Class and Serviced Companion Loan Securities, if any;



 (v)           to modify the procedures herein relating to compliance with Rule 17g-5 of the Exchange Act; and

 (i)            reduce in any manner the amount of, or delay the timing of, payments received on the Mortgage Loans or Serviced Loan Combinations which are required to be distributed on any Certificate, without the consent of the Holders of Certificates representing all of the Percentage Interests of the Class or Classes affected thereby or which are required to be distributed to any Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders without the consent of such Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders;

 (iv)         amend any section hereof which relates to the amendment of this Agreement without the consent of the Holders of all Certificates representing all of the Percentage Interests of the Class or Classes affected thereby and the consent of any affected Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders.

 It shall not be necessary for the consent of Certificateholders under this Section 11.08 to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment, but it shall be sufficient if such consent shall approve the substance thereof.  The method of obtaining such consents and of evidencing the authorization of the execution thereof by Certificateholders and, if applicable, Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders, shall be subject to such reasonable







 regulations as the Trustee may prescribe; provided, that such method shall always be by affirmation and in writing.



 Notwithstanding any contrary provision of this Agreement, no amendment shall be made to this Agreement or any Custodial Agreement unless the Trustee and the Certificate Administrator have received an Opinion of Counsel, at the expense of the party requesting such amendment (or, if such amendment is required to maintain the rating issued by any Rating Agency or requested by the Trustee for any purpose described in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) of the first sentence of this Section, then at the expense of the Trust Fund (and, in the case of any Loan Combination, any such expense shall be allocated in accordance with the expense allocation provision of the related Intercreditor Agreement) confirming that such amendment is authorized or permitted by this Agreement and that all conditions precedent with respect thereto have been satisfied, respectively, hereunder and such amendment will not cause the Lower-Tier REMIC or the Upper-Tier REMIC to fail to qualify as a REMIC at any time that any Certificates are outstanding, or cause the Grantor Trust to fail to qualify as a grantor trust, or cause a tax to be imposed on the Trust Fund or any such Trust REMIC or any such Grantor Trust.



 Prior to the execution of any amendment to this Agreement or any Custodial Agreement, the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator, the Operating Advisor, the Special Servicer and the Master Servicer may request and shall be entitled to rely conclusively upon an Opinion of Counsel and an Officer's Certificate, at the expense of the party requesting such amendment (or, if such amendment is required to maintain the rating issued by any Rating Agency or requested by the Trustee for any purpose described in clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) of the first sentence of this Section 11.08 (which do not modify or otherwise relate solely to the obligations, duties or rights of the Trustee), then at the expense of the Trust Fund (and, in the case of any Loan Combination, any such expense shall be allocated in accordance with the expense allocation provision of the related Intercreditor Agreement)) confirming that the execution of such amendment is authorized or permitted by this Agreement and that all conditions precedent with respect thereto have been satisfied.  The Trustee, the Certificate Administrator or the Operating Advisor may, but shall not be obligated to, enter into any such amendment which affects the Trustee's, the Certificate Administrator's or the Operating Advisor's own rights, duties or immunities under this Agreement.



 Notwithstanding any contrary provision contained in this Agreement, no amendment shall be made to this Agreement (i) which adversely affects the rights, including (without limitation) as a third-party beneficiary hereunder, and/or obligations (including, without limitation, in the case of a Mortgage Loan Seller, under the related Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement) of any Mortgage Loan Seller, Initial Purchaser or Underwriter without the written consent of such Mortgage Loan Seller, Initial Purchaser or Underwriter, as applicable or (ii) which adversely affects (as determined by the applicable Companion Loan Noteholder in good faith) the rights and/or obligations of any Companion Loan Noteholder without the written consent of such Companion Loan Noteholder.



 Promptly after the execution of any amendment to this Agreement, the Certificate Administrator shall post a copy of the same to the Certificate Administrator's Website, deliver a copy of the same to the 17g-5 Information Provider who shall post a copy of the same on the 17g-5 Information Provider's Website pursuant to Section 3.14(d) of this Agreement, and thereafter, the Certificate Administrator shall furnish written notification of the substance of such







 amendment to each Certificateholder, each Serviced Companion Loan Noteholder, the Depositor, the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Operating Advisor, the Trustee, each Mortgage Loan Seller, the Underwriters and the Initial Purchasers.



 Section 11.09     Confirmation of Intent.  It is the express intent of the parties hereto that the conveyance of the Trust Fund (including the Mortgage Loans) by the Depositor to the Trustee on behalf of Certificateholders as contemplated by this Agreement be treated for all purposes as a sale by the Depositor of the Trust Fund to the Trustee.  It is, further, not the intention of the parties that such conveyance be deemed a pledge of the Trust Fund by the Depositor to the Trustee to secure a debt or other obligation of the Depositor.  However, if, notwithstanding the intent of the parties, the Trust Fund is held to continue to be property of the Depositor then (a) this Agreement shall also be deemed to be a security agreement under applicable law; (b) the transfer of the Trust Fund provided for herein shall be deemed to be a grant by the Depositor to the Trustee on behalf of Certificateholders of a first priority security interest in, and the Depositor hereby grants to the Trustee a security interest in, all of the Depositor's right, title and interest in and to, whether now owned or existing or hereafter acquired or arising, the property identified in clauses (i) through (xiv) of the definition of "Trust Fund" and all proceeds thereof; (c) the possession by the Trustee (or the Custodian on its behalf) of Notes and such other items of property as constitute instruments, money, negotiable documents or chattel paper shall be deemed to be "possession by the secured party" for purposes of perfecting the security interest pursuant to Section 9-313 of the New York Uniform Commercial Code; and (d) notifications to Persons holding such property, and acknowledgments, receipts or confirmations from Persons holding such property, shall be deemed notifications to, or acknowledgments, receipts or confirmations from, financial intermediaries, bailees or agents (as applicable) of the Trustee for the purpose of perfecting such security interest under applicable law.  The Depositor shall, and upon the request and direction of the Master Servicer, the Trustee shall, to the extent consistent with this Agreement (and at the expense of the Trust Fund (and, in the case of any Loan Combination, such expense shall be allocated in accordance with the expense allocation provision of the related Intercreditor Agreement)), take such actions as may be necessary to ensure that such security interest is a perfected security interest of first priority under applicable law and will be maintained as such throughout the term of this Agreement.  It is the intent of the parties that such a security interest would be effective whether any of the Certificates are sold, pledged or assigned.



 Section 11.10     No Intended Third-Party Beneficiaries.  Except as specified in Section 11.12 of this Agreement, no Person other than a party to this Agreement, any Mortgage Loan Seller, any Initial Purchaser, any Underwriter or any Certificateholder shall have any rights with respect to the enforcement of any of the rights or obligations hereunder.  Without limiting the foregoing, the parties to this Agreement specifically state that no Borrower, Manager or other party to a Mortgage Loan is an intended third-party beneficiary of this Agreement.



 Section 11.11     Entire Agreement.  This Agreement (and, with respect to each Loan Combination, together with the related Intercreditor Agreement) contains the entire agreement and understanding between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous agreements, understanding, inducements and conditions, express or implied, oral or written, of any nature whatsoever with respect to the







 subject matter hereof.  The express terms hereof control and supersedes any course of performance or usage of the trade inconsistent with any of the terms hereof.

 Section 11.13     Precautionary Trust Indenture Act Provisions.  In the event that the Depositor notifies the parties to this Agreement that it has determined, in consultation with the Trustee, that the TIA applies to this Agreement or that qualification under the TIA or any similar federal statute hereafter enacted is required (any such determination by the Depositor, a "TIA Applicability Determination"), then, (i) in the case of the TIA, pursuant to Section 318 of the TIA (assuming such section is then in effect), the provisions of Sections 310 to and including Section 317 of the TIA that impose duties on any person are part of and govern this Agreement, whether or not physically contained herein, as and to the extent provided in Section 318 of the TIA; provided that it shall be deemed that the parties to this Agreement have agreed that, to the extent permitted under the TIA, this Agreement shall expressly exclude any non-mandatory provisions that (x) conflict with the provisions of this Agreement or would otherwise alter the provisions of this Agreement or (y) increase the obligations, liabilities or scope of responsibility







 of any party hereto; (ii) the parties agree to cooperate in good faith with the Depositor to make such amendments to modify, eliminate or add to the provisions of this Agreement to the extent necessary to effect the qualification of this Agreement under the TIA or such similar statute and to add to this Agreement such other provisions as may be expressly required by the TIA or as may be determined by the parties to be beneficial for compliance with the TIA; and (iii) upon the direction of the Depositor, the Trustee shall file a Form T-1 or such other form as the Depositor informs the Trustee is required, with the Commission or other appropriate institution.

 This certifies that [              ] is the registered owner of a beneficial ownership interest in a Trust Fund, including the distributions to be made with respect to the Class A-1 Certificates.  The Trust Fund, described more fully below, consists primarily of a pool of Mortgage Loans secured by first liens on commercial and multifamily properties and held in trust by the Trustee and serviced by the Master Servicer.  The Trust Fund was created, and the Mortgage Loans are to be serviced, pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement (as defined below).  The Holder of this Certificate, by virtue of the acceptance hereof, assents to the terms, provisions and conditions of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement and is bound thereby.



 The Pooling and Servicing Agreement, dated as of November 1, 2013 (the "Pooling and Servicing Agreement"), among the Depositor, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as master servicer (the "Master Servicer"), LNR Partners, LLC, as special servicer (the "Special Servicer"), Park Bridge Lender Services LLC, as operating advisor (the "Operating Advisor"), UxxPDSxxPD Bank National Association, as trustee (the "Trustee"), and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as certificate administrator (the "Certificate Administrator"), paying agent and custodian, evidences the issuance of the Class A-1, Class A-2, Class A-3, Class A-4, Class A-SB, Class A-M, Class B, Class PEZ, Class C, Class X-A, Class X-B, Class X-C, Class D, Class E, Class F, Class G, Class V, Class R and Class LR Certificates (the "Certificates"; the Holders of Certificates issued under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement are collectively referred to herein as "Certificateholders").  This Certificate is issued pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.  To the extent not defined herein, capitalized terms used herein shall have the meanings assigned thereto in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.



 This Certificate represents a "regular interest" in a "real estate mortgage investment conduit", as those terms are defined, respectively, in Sections 860G(a)(1) and 860D







 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.  Each Holder of this Certificate, by acceptance hereof, agrees to treat, and take no action inconsistent with the treatment of, this Certificate in accordance with the preceding sentence for purposes of federal income taxes, state and local income and franchise taxes and other taxes imposed on or measured by income.



 The Certificate Administrator makes no representation or warranty as to any of the statements contained herein or the validity or sufficiency of the Certificates or the Mortgage Loans and has executed this Certificate in its limited capacity as Certificate Administrator under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.



 Pursuant to the terms of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, the Certificate Administrator, or the Paying Agent on behalf of the Certificate Administrator, will distribute (other than the final distribution on any Certificate), on the fourth Business Day after each Determination Date (each such date, a "Distribution Date") an amount equal to such Person's pro rata share (based on the Percentage Interest represented by this Certificate) of that portion of the aggregate amount of principal and interest then distributable, if any, allocable to the Class A-1 Certificates for such Distribution Date, all as more fully described in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.  "Determination Date" is defined in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement as the sixth day of each month, or if such sixth day is not a Business Day, then the next Business Day, commencing in December 2013.  Holders of this Certificate may be entitled to Prepayment Premiums and Yield Maintenance Charges as provided in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.



 During each Interest Accrual Period (as defined below), interest on the Class A-1 Certificates will be calculated based on a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months on the outstanding Certificate Balance hereof.



 Interest accrued on this Certificate during an Interest Accrual Period, plus the aggregate unpaid Interest Shortfall with respect to this Certificate, if any, will be payable on the related Distribution Date to the extent provided in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.  The "Interest Accrual Period" means, with respect to any Distribution Date, the calendar month immediately preceding the month in which such Distribution Date occurs.  Each Interest Accrual Period is assumed to consist of 30 days.



 All distributions (other than the final distribution on any Certificate) will be made by the Paying Agent to the Persons in whose names the Certificates are registered at the close of business on each Record Date, which will be the close of business on the last Business Day of the calendar month preceding the month in which such Distribution Date occurs; provided that with respect to the Distribution Date occurring in December 2013, the Record Date will be the Closing Date.  Such distributions shall be made on each Distribution Date other than the Termination Date to each Certificateholder of record on the related Record Date, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account of such Holder at a bank or other entity located in the United States and having appropriate facilities therefor if such Holder shall have provided the Paying Agent with wire instructions in writing at least five Business Days prior to the related Record Date, or, otherwise, by check mailed by first-class mail to the address set forth therefor in the Certificate Register.  The final distribution on each Certificate shall be made in like manner, but only upon presentment and surrender of such Certificate at the office of the Certificate







 Administrator or its agent (which may be the Paying Agent or the Certificate Registrar acting as such agent) that is specified in the notice to Holders of such final distribution.



 Any funds not distributed on the Termination Date because of the failure of any Certificateholders to tender their Certificates shall, on such date, be set aside and held in trust for the benefit of the appropriate non-tendering Certificateholders.  If any Certificates as to which notice of the Termination Date has been given pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement shall not have been surrendered for cancellation within six months after the time specified in such notice, the Certificate Administrator shall mail a second notice to the remaining non-tendering Certificateholders, at their last addresses shown in the Certificate Register, to surrender their Certificates for cancellation in order to receive, from such funds held, the final distribution with respect thereto.  If within one year after the second notice not all of such Certificates shall have been surrendered for cancellation, the Certificate Administrator may, directly or through an agent, take appropriate steps to contact the remaining non-tendering Certificateholders concerning surrender of their Certificates.  The costs and expenses of holding such funds in trust and of contacting such Certificateholders shall be paid out of such funds.  If within two years after the second notice any such Certificates shall not have been surrendered for cancellation, the Paying Agent shall pay to the Certificate Administrator all amounts distributable to the Holders thereof, and the Certificate Administrator shall thereafter hold such amounts for the benefit of such Holders until the earlier of (i) its termination as Certificate Administrator under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement and the transfer of such amounts to a successor certificate administrator and (ii) the termination of the Trust Fund and distribution of such amounts to the Residual Certificateholders.  No interest shall accrue or be payable to any Certificateholder on any amount held as a result of such Certificateholder's failure to surrender its Certificate(s) for final payment thereof in accordance with the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.  Such funds held by the Certificate Administrator may be invested under certain circumstances, and all income and gain realized from investment of such funds shall accrue for its benefit.



 This Certificate is limited in right of payment to, among other things, certain collections and recoveries in respect of the Mortgage Loans, as more specifically set forth herein and in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.



 As provided in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, the Trust Fund includes (in each case and to the extent of the Trust Fund's interest therein and specifically excluding any interest of any Serviced Companion Loan Noteholder therein) (i) such Mortgage Loans as from time to time are subject to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, together with the Mortgage Files relating thereto; (ii) all scheduled or unscheduled payments on or collections in respect of the Mortgage Loans due after the Cut-off Date; (iii) the Trust Fund's interest in any REO Property; (iv) all revenues received in respect of any REO Property; (v) any Assignments of Leases, Rents and Profits and any security agreements related to the Mortgage Loans; (vi) any indemnities or guaranties given as additional security for any Mortgage Loans; (vii) a security interest in all assets deposited in the Lock-Box Accounts, Cash Collateral Accounts, Escrow Accounts and Reserve Accounts; (viii) the Loss of Value Reserve Fund; (ix) the Collection Account, the Serviced Loan Combination Collection Accounts, the Distribution Accounts, any Excess Liquidation Proceeds Account, the Interest Reserve Account and the Trust's interest in any REO Account, including any amounts on deposit therein, assets credited thereto and any







 reinvestment income, as applicable; (x) a security interest in any environmental indemnity agreements relating to the Mortgaged Properties; (xi) a security interest in all insurance policies with respect to the Mortgage Loans and the Mortgaged Properties; (xii) the rights and remedies under the Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreements relating to document delivery requirements with respect to the Mortgage Loans and the representations and warranties of the related Mortgage Loan Seller regarding its Mortgage Loans; (xiii) the Lower-Tier Regular Interests and the Class EC Regular Interests and (xiv) the proceeds of the foregoing (other than any interest earned on deposits in the Lock-Box Accounts, Cash Collateral Accounts, Escrow Accounts and any Reserve Accounts, to the extent such interest belongs to the related Borrower).  As provided in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, withdrawals may be made from certain of the above-accounts for purposes other than distributions to Certificateholders.

In no event shall any such amendment cause the Lower-Tier REMIC or the Upper-Tier REMIC to fail to qualify as a REMIC or the Grantor Trust to fail to qualify as a grantor trust or to significantly change the activities of the Trust.



 The Pooling and Servicing Agreement or any Custodial Agreement may also be amended from time to time by the Depositor, the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the







 Certificate Administrator, the Operating Advisor and the Trustee with the prior written consent of the Holders of Certificates representing not less than 66-2/3% of the Percentage Interests of each Class of Certificates affected thereby (without regard to Certificates held by the Depositor, any of the Depositor's Affiliates and/or agents) and each Serviced Companion Loan Noteholder affected thereby for the purpose of adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement or modifying in any manner the rights of the Certificateholders or the Serviced Companion Noteholders; provided, that no such amendment may:



        (i)   reduce in any manner the amount of, or delay the timing of, payments received on the Mortgage Loans or Serviced Loan Combinations which are required to be distributed on any Certificate, without the consent of the Holders of Certificates representing all of the Percentage Interests of the Class or Classes affected thereby or which are required to be distributed to any Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders without the consent of such Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders;



        (ii)   change the percentages of Voting Rights or Percentage Interests of Holders of Certificates which are required to consent to any action or inaction under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement;



        (iii)   alter the Servicing Standard, the Operating Advisor Standard or obligations of the Master Servicer or the Trustee to make a P&I Advance or a Property Advance, without the consent of the Holders of Certificates representing all of the Percentage Interests of the Class or Classes affected thereby and the consent of any affected Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders; or



        (iv)   amend any section hereof which relates to the amendment of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement without the consent of the Holders of all Certificates representing all of the Percentage Interests of the Class or Classes affected thereby and the consent of any affected Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders.



 Further, the Depositor, the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Certificate Administrator, the Operating Advisor and the Trustee, at any time and from time to time, without the consent of the Certificateholders or, if applicable, the Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders, may amend the Pooling and Servicing Agreement to modify, eliminate or add to any of its provisions (i) to such extent as shall be necessary to maintain the qualification of the Lower-Tier REMIC or the Upper-Tier REMIC as a REMIC or the qualification of the Grantor Trust as a grantor trust, or to prevent the imposition of any additional material state or local taxes, at all times that any Certificates are outstanding; provided, that such action, as evidenced by an Opinion of Counsel (obtained at the expense of the Trust Fund), is necessary or helpful to maintain such qualification or to prevent the imposition of any such taxes, and would not adversely affect in any material respect the interest of any Certificateholder or, if applicable, any Serviced Companion Loan Noteholder or (ii) to the extent necessary to comply with the







 Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, the Exchange Act, Regulation AB, and/or any related regulatory actions and/or interpretations.

 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.  Each Holder of this Certificate, by acceptance hereof, agrees to treat, and take no action inconsistent with the treatment of, this Certificate in accordance with the preceding sentence for purposes of federal income taxes, state and local income and franchise taxes and other taxes imposed on or measured by income.



 The Certificate Administrator makes no representation or warranty as to any of the statements contained herein or the validity or sufficiency of the Certificates or the Mortgage Loans and has executed this Certificate in its limited capacity as Certificate Administrator under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.



 Pursuant to the terms of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, the Certificate Administrator, or the Paying Agent on behalf of the Certificate Administrator, will distribute (other than the final distribution on any Certificate), on the fourth Business Day after each Determination Date (each such date, a "Distribution Date") an amount equal to such Person's pro rata share (based on the Percentage Interest represented by this Certificate) of that portion of the aggregate amount of principal and interest then distributable, if any, allocable to the Class A-2 Certificates for such Distribution Date, all as more fully described in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.  "Determination Date" is defined in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement as the sixth day of each month, or if such sixth day is not a Business Day, then the next Business Day, commencing in December 2013.  Holders of this Certificate may be entitled to Prepayment Premiums and Yield Maintenance Charges as provided in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.



 During each Interest Accrual Period (as defined below), interest on the Class A-2 Certificates will be calculated based on a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months on the outstanding Certificate Balance hereof.



 Interest accrued on this Certificate during an Interest Accrual Period, plus the aggregate unpaid Interest Shortfall with respect to this Certificate, if any, will be payable on the related Distribution Date to the extent provided in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.  The "Interest Accrual Period" means, with respect to any Distribution Date, the calendar month immediately preceding the month in which such Distribution Date occurs.  Each Interest Accrual Period is assumed to consist of 30 days.



 All distributions (other than the final distribution on any Certificate) will be made by the Paying Agent to the Persons in whose names the Certificates are registered at the close of business on each Record Date, which will be the close of business on the last Business Day of the calendar month preceding the month in which such Distribution Date occurs; provided that with respect to the Distribution Date occurring in December 2013, the Record Date will be the Closing Date.  Such distributions shall be made on each Distribution Date other than the Termination Date to each Certificateholder of record on the related Record Date, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account of such Holder at a bank or other entity located in the United States and having appropriate facilities therefor if such Holder shall have provided the Paying Agent with wire instructions in writing at least five Business Days prior to the related Record Date, or, otherwise, by check mailed by first-class mail to the address set forth therefor in the Certificate Register.  The final distribution on each Certificate shall be made in like manner, but only upon presentment and surrender of such Certificate at the office of the Certificate







 Administrator or its agent (which may be the Paying Agent or the Certificate Registrar acting as such agent) that is specified in the notice to Holders of such final distribution.



 Any funds not distributed on the Termination Date because of the failure of any Certificateholders to tender their Certificates shall, on such date, be set aside and held in trust for the benefit of the appropriate non-tendering Certificateholders.  If any Certificates as to which notice of the Termination Date has been given pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement shall not have been surrendered for cancellation within six months after the time specified in such notice, the Certificate Administrator shall mail a second notice to the remaining non-tendering Certificateholders, at their last addresses shown in the Certificate Register, to surrender their Certificates for cancellation in order to receive, from such funds held, the final distribution with respect thereto.  If within one year after the second notice not all of such Certificates shall have been surrendered for cancellation, the Certificate Administrator may, directly or through an agent, take appropriate steps to contact the remaining non-tendering Certificateholders concerning surrender of their Certificates.  The costs and expenses of holding such funds in trust and of contacting such Certificateholders shall be paid out of such funds.  If within two years after the second notice any such Certificates shall not have been surrendered for cancellation, the Paying Agent shall pay to the Certificate Administrator all amounts distributable to the Holders thereof, and the Certificate Administrator shall thereafter hold such amounts for the benefit of such Holders until the earlier of (i) its termination as Certificate Administrator under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement and the transfer of such amounts to a successor certificate administrator and (ii) the termination of the Trust Fund and distribution of such amounts to the Residual Certificateholders.  No interest shall accrue or be payable to any Certificateholder on any amount held as a result of such Certificateholder's failure to surrender its Certificate(s) for final payment thereof in accordance with the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.  Such funds held by the Certificate Administrator may be invested under certain circumstances, and all income and gain realized from investment of such funds shall accrue for its benefit.



 This Certificate is limited in right of payment to, among other things, certain collections and recoveries in respect of the Mortgage Loans, as more specifically set forth herein and in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.

Such amendment (a) shall not materially increase the obligations of the Depositor, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Certificate Administrator, the Operating Advisor, the 17g-5 Information Provider, the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer without such party's consent; and (b) shall not adversely affect in any material respect the interests of any Certificateholder or Serviced Companion Loan Noteholder not consenting thereto, as evidenced in the case of clauses (iii) through (v) above by (x) an Opinion of Counsel or (y) solely in the case of a Certificateholder of a rated Class, receipt of a No Downgrade Confirmation from each applicable Rating Agency.  In no event shall any such amendment cause the Lower-Tier REMIC or the Upper-Tier REMIC to fail to qualify as a REMIC or the Grantor Trust to fail to qualify as a grantor trust or to significantly change the activities of the Trust.



 The Pooling and Servicing Agreement or any Custodial Agreement may also be amended from time to time by the Depositor, the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the







 Certificate Administrator, the Operating Advisor and the Trustee with the prior written consent of the Holders of Certificates representing not less than 66-2/3% of the Percentage Interests of each Class of Certificates affected thereby (without regard to Certificates held by the Depositor, any of the Depositor's Affiliates and/or agents) and each Serviced Companion Loan Noteholder affected thereby for the purpose of adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement or modifying in any manner the rights of the Certificateholders or the Serviced Companion Noteholders; provided, that no such amendment may:



        (i)   reduce in any manner the amount of, or delay the timing of, payments received on the Mortgage Loans or Serviced Loan Combinations which are required to be distributed on any Certificate, without the consent of the Holders of Certificates representing all of the Percentage Interests of the Class or Classes affected thereby or which are required to be distributed to any Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders without the consent of such Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders;



        (ii)   change the percentages of Voting Rights or Percentage Interests of Holders of Certificates which are required to consent to any action or inaction under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement;

      (iv)   amend any section hereof which relates to the amendment of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement without the consent of the Holders of all Certificates representing all of the Percentage Interests of the Class or Classes affected thereby and the consent of any affected Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders.



 Further, the Depositor, the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Certificate Administrator, the Operating Advisor and the Trustee, at any time and from time to time, without the consent of the Certificateholders or, if applicable, the Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders, may amend the Pooling and Servicing Agreement to modify, eliminate or add to any of its provisions (i) to such extent as shall be necessary to maintain the qualification of the Lower-Tier REMIC or the Upper-Tier REMIC as a REMIC or the qualification of the Grantor Trust as a grantor trust, or to prevent the imposition of any additional material state or local taxes, at all times that any Certificates are outstanding; provided, that such action, as evidenced by an Opinion of Counsel (obtained at the expense of the Trust Fund), is necessary or helpful to maintain such qualification or to prevent the imposition of any such taxes, and would not adversely affect in any material respect the interest of any Certificateholder or, if applicable, any Serviced Companion Loan Noteholder or (ii) to the extent necessary to comply with the







 Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, the Exchange Act, Regulation AB, and/or any related regulatory actions and/or interpretations.

        (B)   the fair market value of all other property included in the Trust Fund as of the last day of the month preceding such Anticipated Termination Date, as determined by an Independent appraiser acceptable to the Master Servicer as of a date not more than 30 days prior to the last day of the month preceding such Distribution Date;



        (C)   all unpaid interest accrued on the unpaid balance of each Mortgage Loan (including any Mortgage Loan as to which title to the related Mortgaged Property has been acquired) at the Mortgage Rate to the last day of the month preceding such Anticipated Termination Date (less any P&I Advances previously made on account of interest); and



        (D)   the aggregate amount of unreimbursed Advances, with interest thereon at the Advance Rate, and unpaid Servicing Compensation, Special Servicing Compensation, Operating Advisor Fees, Trustee/Certificate Administrator Fees, the CREFC® License Fees and Trust Fund expenses.

 This certifies that [              ] is the registered owner of a beneficial ownership interest in a Trust Fund, including the distributions to be made with respect to the Class A-3 Certificates.  The Trust Fund, described more fully below, consists primarily of a pool of Mortgage Loans secured by first liens on commercial and multifamily properties and held in trust by the Trustee and serviced by the Master Servicer.  The Trust Fund was created, and the Mortgage Loans are to be serviced, pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement (as defined below).  The Holder of this Certificate, by virtue of the acceptance hereof, assents to the terms, provisions and conditions of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement and is bound thereby.



 The Pooling and Servicing Agreement, dated as of November 1, 2013 (the "Pooling and Servicing Agreement"), among the Depositor, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as master servicer (the "Master Servicer"), LNR Partners, LLC, as special servicer (the "Special Servicer"), Park Bridge Lender Services LLC, as operating advisor (the "Operating Advisor"), UxxPDSxxPD Bank National Association, as trustee (the "Trustee"), and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as certificate administrator (the "Certificate Administrator"), paying agent and custodian, evidences the issuance of the Class A-1, Class A-2, Class A-3, Class A-4, Class A-SB, Class A-M, Class B, Class PEZ, Class C, Class X-A, Class X-B, Class X-C, Class D, Class E, Class F, Class G, Class V, Class R and Class LR Certificates (the "Certificates"; the Holders of Certificates issued under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement are collectively referred to herein as "Certificateholders").  This Certificate is issued pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.  To the extent not defined herein, capitalized terms used herein shall have the meanings assigned thereto in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.



 This Certificate represents a "regular interest" in a "real estate mortgage investment conduit", as those terms are defined, respectively, in Sections 860G(a)(1) and 860D







 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.  Each Holder of this Certificate, by acceptance hereof, agrees to treat, and take no action inconsistent with the treatment of, this Certificate in accordance with the preceding sentence for purposes of federal income taxes, state and local income and franchise taxes and other taxes imposed on or measured by income.



 The Certificate Administrator makes no representation or warranty as to any of the statements contained herein or the validity or sufficiency of the Certificates or the Mortgage Loans and has executed this Certificate in its limited capacity as Certificate Administrator under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.



 Pursuant to the terms of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, the Certificate Administrator, or the Paying Agent on behalf of the Certificate Administrator, will distribute (other than the final distribution on any Certificate), on the fourth Business Day after each Determination Date (each such date, a "Distribution Date") an amount equal to such Person's pro rata share (based on the Percentage Interest represented by this Certificate) of that portion of the aggregate amount of principal and interest then distributable, if any, allocable to the Class A-3 Certificates for such Distribution Date, all as more fully described in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.  "Determination Date" is defined in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement as the sixth day of each month, or if such sixth day is not a Business Day, then the next Business Day, commencing in December 2013.  Holders of this Certificate may be entitled to Prepayment Premiums and Yield Maintenance Charges as provided in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.



 During each Interest Accrual Period (as defined below), interest on the Class A-3 Certificates will be calculated based on a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months on the outstanding Certificate Balance hereof.



 Interest accrued on this Certificate during an Interest Accrual Period, plus the aggregate unpaid Interest Shortfall with respect to this Certificate, if any, will be payable on the related Distribution Date to the extent provided in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.  The "Interest Accrual Period" means, with respect to any Distribution Date, the calendar month immediately preceding the month in which such Distribution Date occurs.  Each Interest Accrual Period is assumed to consist of 30 days.



 All distributions (other than the final distribution on any Certificate) will be made by the Paying Agent to the Persons in whose names the Certificates are registered at the close of business on each Record Date, which will be the close of business on the last Business Day of the calendar month preceding the month in which such Distribution Date occurs; provided that with respect to the Distribution Date occurring in December 2013, the Record Date will be the Closing Date.  Such distributions shall be made on each Distribution Date other than the Termination Date to each Certificateholder of record on the related Record Date, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account of such Holder at a bank or other entity located in the United States and having appropriate facilities therefor if such Holder shall have provided the Paying Agent with wire instructions in writing at least five Business Days prior to the related Record Date, or, otherwise, by check mailed by first-class mail to the address set forth therefor in the Certificate Register.  The final distribution on each Certificate shall be made in like manner, but only upon presentment and surrender of such Certificate at the office of the Certificate







 Administrator or its agent (which may be the Paying Agent or the Certificate Registrar acting as such agent) that is specified in the notice to Holders of such final distribution.



 Any funds not distributed on the Termination Date because of the failure of any Certificateholders to tender their Certificates shall, on such date, be set aside and held in trust for the benefit of the appropriate non-tendering Certificateholders.  If any Certificates as to which notice of the Termination Date has been given pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement shall not have been surrendered for cancellation within six months after the time specified in such notice, the Certificate Administrator shall mail a second notice to the remaining non-tendering Certificateholders, at their last addresses shown in the Certificate Register, to surrender their Certificates for cancellation in order to receive, from such funds held, the final distribution with respect thereto.  If within one year after the second notice not all of such Certificates shall have been surrendered for cancellation, the Certificate Administrator may, directly or through an agent, take appropriate steps to contact the remaining non-tendering Certificateholders concerning surrender of their Certificates.  The costs and expenses of holding such funds in trust and of contacting such Certificateholders shall be paid out of such funds.  If within two years after the second notice any such Certificates shall not have been surrendered for cancellation, the Paying Agent shall pay to the Certificate Administrator all amounts distributable to the Holders thereof, and the Certificate Administrator shall thereafter hold such amounts for the benefit of such Holders until the earlier of (i) its termination as Certificate Administrator under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement and the transfer of such amounts to a successor certificate administrator and (ii) the termination of the Trust Fund and distribution of such amounts to the Residual Certificateholders.  No interest shall accrue or be payable to any Certificateholder on any amount held as a result of such Certificateholder's failure to surrender its Certificate(s) for final payment thereof in accordance with the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.

 The Pooling and Servicing Agreement or any Custodial Agreement may also be amended from time to time by the Depositor, the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the

        (i)   reduce in any manner the amount of, or delay the timing of, payments received on the Mortgage Loans or Serviced Loan Combinations which are required to be distributed on any Certificate, without the consent of the Holders of Certificates representing all of the Percentage Interests of the Class or Classes affected thereby or which are required to be distributed to any Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders without the consent of such Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders;

 This certifies that [              ] is the registered owner of a beneficial ownership interest in a Trust Fund, including the distributions to be made with respect to the Class A-4 Certificates.  The Trust Fund, described more fully below, consists primarily of a pool of Mortgage Loans secured by first liens on commercial and multifamily properties and held in trust by the Trustee and serviced by the Master Servicer.  The Trust Fund was created, and the Mortgage Loans are to be serviced, pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement (as defined below).  The Holder of this Certificate, by virtue of the acceptance hereof, assents to the terms, provisions and conditions of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement and is bound thereby.



 The Pooling and Servicing Agreement, dated as of November 1, 2013 (the "Pooling and Servicing Agreement"), among the Depositor, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as master servicer (the "Master Servicer"), LNR Partners, LLC, as special servicer (the "Special Servicer"), Park Bridge Lender Services LLC, as operating advisor (the "Operating Advisor"), UxxPDSxxPD Bank National Association, as trustee (the "Trustee"), and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as certificate administrator (the "Certificate Administrator"), paying agent and custodian, evidences the issuance of the Class A-1, Class A-2, Class A-3, Class A-4, Class A-SB, Class A-M, Class B, Class PEZ, Class C, Class X-A, Class X-B, Class X-C, Class D, Class E, Class F, Class G, Class V, Class R and Class LR Certificates (the "Certificates"; the Holders of Certificates issued under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement are collectively referred to herein as "Certificateholders").  This Certificate is issued pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.  To the extent not defined herein, capitalized terms used herein shall have the meanings assigned thereto in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.



 This Certificate represents a "regular interest" in a "real estate mortgage investment conduit", as those terms are defined, respectively, in Sections 860G(a)(1) and 860D







 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.  Each Holder of this Certificate, by acceptance hereof, agrees to treat, and take no action inconsistent with the treatment of, this Certificate in accordance with the preceding sentence for purposes of federal income taxes, state and local income and franchise taxes and other taxes imposed on or measured by income.



 The Certificate Administrator makes no representation or warranty as to any of the statements contained herein or the validity or sufficiency of the Certificates or the Mortgage Loans and has executed this Certificate in its limited capacity as Certificate Administrator under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.



 Pursuant to the terms of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, the Certificate Administrator, or the Paying Agent on behalf of the Certificate Administrator, will distribute (other than the final distribution on any Certificate), on the fourth Business Day after each Determination Date (each such date, a "Distribution Date") an amount equal to such Person's pro rata share (based on the Percentage Interest represented by this Certificate) of that portion of the aggregate amount of principal and interest then distributable, if any, allocable to the Class A-4 Certificates for such Distribution Date, all as more fully described in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.  "Determination Date" is defined in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement as the sixth day of each month, or if such sixth day is not a Business Day, then the next Business Day, commencing in December 2013.  Holders of this Certificate may be entitled to Prepayment Premiums and Yield Maintenance Charges as provided in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.



 During each Interest Accrual Period (as defined below), interest on the Class A-4 Certificates will be calculated based on a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months on the outstanding Certificate Balance hereof.



 Interest accrued on this Certificate during an Interest Accrual Period, plus the aggregate unpaid Interest Shortfall with respect to this Certificate, if any, will be payable on the related Distribution Date to the extent provided in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.  The "Interest Accrual Period" means, with respect to any Distribution Date, the calendar month immediately preceding the month in which such Distribution Date occurs.  Each Interest Accrual Period is assumed to consist of 30 days.



 All distributions (other than the final distribution on any Certificate) will be made by the Paying Agent to the Persons in whose names the Certificates are registered at the close of business on each Record Date, which will be the close of business on the last Business Day of the calendar month preceding the month in which such Distribution Date occurs; provided that with respect to the Distribution Date occurring in December 2013, the Record Date will be the Closing Date.  Such distributions shall be made on each Distribution Date other than the Termination Date to each Certificateholder of record on the related Record Date, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account of such Holder at a bank or other entity located in the United States and having appropriate facilities therefor if such Holder shall have provided the Paying Agent with wire instructions in writing at least five Business Days prior to the related Record Date, or, otherwise, by check mailed by first-class mail to the address set forth therefor in the Certificate Register.  The final distribution on each Certificate shall be made in like manner, but only upon presentment and surrender of such Certificate at the office of the Certificate







 Administrator or its agent (which may be the Paying Agent or the Certificate Registrar acting as such agent) that is specified in the notice to Holders of such final distribution.



 Any funds not distributed on the Termination Date because of the failure of any Certificateholders to tender their Certificates shall, on such date, be set aside and held in trust for the benefit of the appropriate non-tendering Certificateholders.  If any Certificates as to which notice of the Termination Date has been given pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement shall not have been surrendered for cancellation within six months after the time specified in such notice, the Certificate Administrator shall mail a second notice to the remaining non-tendering Certificateholders, at their last addresses shown in the Certificate Register, to surrender their Certificates for cancellation in order to receive, from such funds held, the final distribution with respect thereto.  If within one year after the second notice not all of such Certificates shall have been surrendered for cancellation, the Certificate Administrator may, directly or through an agent, take appropriate steps to contact the remaining non-tendering Certificateholders concerning surrender of their Certificates.  The costs and expenses of holding such funds in trust and of contacting such Certificateholders shall be paid out of such funds.  If within two years after the second notice any such Certificates shall not have been surrendered for cancellation, the Paying Agent shall pay to the Certificate Administrator all amounts distributable to the Holders thereof, and the Certificate Administrator shall thereafter hold such amounts for the benefit of such Holders until the earlier of (i) its termination as Certificate Administrator under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement and the transfer of such amounts to a successor certificate administrator and (ii) the termination of the Trust Fund and distribution of such amounts to the Residual Certificateholders.  No interest shall accrue or be payable to any Certificateholder on any amount held as a result of such Certificateholder's failure to surrender its Certificate(s) for final payment thereof in accordance with the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.  Such funds held by the Certificate Administrator may be invested under certain circumstances, and all income and gain realized from investment of such funds shall accrue for its benefit.

In no event shall any such amendment cause the Lower-Tier REMIC or the Upper-Tier REMIC to fail to qualify as a REMIC or the Grantor Trust to fail to qualify as a grantor trust or to significantly change the activities of the Trust.



 The Pooling and Servicing Agreement or any Custodial Agreement may also be amended from time to time by the Depositor, the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the







 Certificate Administrator, the Operating Advisor and the Trustee with the prior written consent of the Holders of Certificates representing not less than 66-2/3% of the Percentage Interests of each Class of Certificates affected thereby (without regard to Certificates held by the Depositor, any of the Depositor's Affiliates and/or agents) and each Serviced Companion Loan Noteholder affected thereby for the purpose of adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement or modifying in any manner the rights of the Certificateholders or the Serviced Companion Noteholders; provided, that no such amendment may:



        (i)         reduce in any manner the amount of, or delay the timing of, payments received on the Mortgage Loans or Serviced Loan Combinations which are required to be distributed on any Certificate, without the consent of the Holders of Certificates representing all of the Percentage Interests of the Class or Classes affected thereby or which are required to be distributed to any Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders without the consent of such Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders;



      (ii)        change the percentages of Voting Rights or Percentage Interests of Holders of Certificates which are required to consent to any action or inaction under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement;

      (iv)     amend any section hereof which relates to the amendment of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement without the consent of the Holders of all Certificates representing all of the Percentage Interests of the Class or Classes affected thereby and the consent of any affected Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders.

 Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, the Exchange Act, Regulation AB, and/or any related regulatory actions and/or interpretations.

        (C)   all unpaid interest accrued on the unpaid balance of each Mortgage Loan (including any Mortgage Loan as to which title to the related Mortgaged Property has been acquired) at the Mortgage Rate to the last day of the month preceding such Anticipated Termination Date (less any P&I Advances previously made on account of interest); and



        (D)   the aggregate amount of unreimbursed Advances, with interest thereon at the Advance Rate, and unpaid Servicing Compensation, Special Servicing Compensation, Operating Advisor Fees, Trustee/Certificate Administrator Fees, the CREFC® License Fees and Trust Fund expenses.

 All costs and expenses incurred by any and all parties to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement or by the Trust Fund in connection with the purchase of the Mortgage Loans and the other assets of the Trust Fund pursuant to Section 9.01(c) of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement shall be borne by the party exercising its purchase rights thereunder.

 This certifies that [              ] is the registered owner of a beneficial ownership interest in a Trust Fund, including the distributions to be made with respect to the Class A-SB Certificates.  The Trust Fund, described more fully below, consists primarily of a pool of Mortgage Loans secured by first liens on commercial and multifamily properties and held in trust by the Trustee and serviced by the Master Servicer.  The Trust Fund was created, and the Mortgage Loans are to be serviced, pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement (as defined below).  The Holder of this Certificate, by virtue of the acceptance hereof, assents to the terms, provisions and conditions of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement and is bound thereby.



 The Pooling and Servicing Agreement, dated as of November 1, 2013 (the "Pooling and Servicing Agreement"), among the Depositor, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as master servicer (the "Master Servicer"), LNR Partners, LLC, as special servicer (the "Special Servicer"), Park Bridge Lender Services LLC, as operating advisor (the "Operating Advisor"), UxxPDSxxPD Bank National Association, as trustee (the "Trustee"), and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as certificate administrator (the "Certificate Administrator"), paying agent and custodian, evidences the issuance of the Class A-1, Class A-2, Class A-3, Class A-4, Class A-SB, Class A-M, Class B, Class PEZ, Class C, Class X-A, Class X-B, Class X-C, Class D, Class E, Class F, Class G, Class V, Class R and Class LR Certificates (the "Certificates"; the Holders of Certificates issued under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement are collectively referred to herein as "Certificateholders").  This Certificate is issued pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.  To the extent not defined herein, capitalized terms used herein shall have the meanings assigned thereto in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.



 This Certificate represents a "regular interest" in a "real estate mortgage investment conduit", as those terms are defined, respectively, in Sections 860G(a)(1) and 860D







 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.  Each Holder of this Certificate, by acceptance hereof, agrees to treat, and take no action inconsistent with the treatment of, this Certificate in accordance with the preceding sentence for purposes of federal income taxes, state and local income and franchise taxes and other taxes imposed on or measured by income.



 The Certificate Administrator makes no representation or warranty as to any of the statements contained herein or the validity or sufficiency of the Certificates or the Mortgage Loans and has executed this Certificate in its limited capacity as Certificate Administrator under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.



 Pursuant to the terms of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, the Certificate Administrator, or the Paying Agent on behalf of the Certificate Administrator, will distribute (other than the final distribution on any Certificate), on the fourth Business Day after each Determination Date (each such date, a "Distribution Date") an amount equal to such Person's pro rata share (based on the Percentage Interest represented by this Certificate) of that portion of the aggregate amount of principal and interest then distributable, if any, allocable to the Class A-SB Certificates for such Distribution Date, all as more fully described in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.  "Determination Date" is defined in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement as the sixth day of each month, or if such sixth day is not a Business Day, then the next Business Day, commencing in December 2013.  Holders of this Certificate may be entitled to Prepayment Premiums and Yield Maintenance Charges as provided in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.



 During each Interest Accrual Period (as defined below), interest on the Class A-SB Certificates will be calculated based on a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months on the outstanding Certificate Balance hereof.



 Interest accrued on this Certificate during an Interest Accrual Period, plus the aggregate unpaid Interest Shortfall with respect to this Certificate, if any, will be payable on the related Distribution Date to the extent provided in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.  The "Interest Accrual Period" means, with respect to any Distribution Date, the calendar month immediately preceding the month in which such Distribution Date occurs.  Each Interest Accrual Period is assumed to consist of 30 days.



 All distributions (other than the final distribution on any Certificate) will be made by the Paying Agent to the Persons in whose names the Certificates are registered at the close of business on each Record Date, which will be the close of business on the last Business Day of the calendar month preceding the month in which such Distribution Date occurs; provided that with respect to the Distribution Date occurring in December 2013, the Record Date will be the Closing Date.  Such distributions shall be made on each Distribution Date other than the Termination Date to each Certificateholder of record on the related Record Date, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account of such Holder at a bank or other entity located in the United States and having appropriate facilities therefor if such Holder shall have provided the Paying Agent with wire instructions in writing at least five Business Days prior to the related Record Date, or, otherwise, by check mailed by first-class mail to the address set forth therefor in the Certificate Register.  The final distribution on each Certificate shall be made in like manner, but only upon presentment and surrender of such Certificate at the office of the Certificate







 Administrator or its agent (which may be the Paying Agent or the Certificate Registrar acting as such agent) that is specified in the notice to Holders of such final distribution.



 Any funds not distributed on the Termination Date because of the failure of any Certificateholders to tender their Certificates shall, on such date, be set aside and held in trust for the benefit of the appropriate non-tendering Certificateholders.  If any Certificates as to which notice of the Termination Date has been given pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement shall not have been surrendered for cancellation within six months after the time specified in such notice, the Certificate Administrator shall mail a second notice to the remaining non-tendering Certificateholders, at their last addresses shown in the Certificate Register, to surrender their Certificates for cancellation in order to receive, from such funds held, the final distribution with respect thereto.  If within one year after the second notice not all of such Certificates shall have been surrendered for cancellation, the Certificate Administrator may, directly or through an agent, take appropriate steps to contact the remaining non-tendering Certificateholders concerning surrender of their Certificates.  The costs and expenses of holding such funds in trust and of contacting such Certificateholders shall be paid out of such funds.  If within two years after the second notice any such Certificates shall not have been surrendered for cancellation, the Paying Agent shall pay to the Certificate Administrator all amounts distributable to the Holders thereof, and the Certificate Administrator shall thereafter hold such amounts for the benefit of such Holders until the earlier of (i) its termination as Certificate Administrator under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement and the transfer of such amounts to a successor certificate administrator and (ii) the termination of the Trust Fund and distribution of such amounts to the Residual Certificateholders.  No interest shall accrue or be payable to any Certificateholder on any amount held as a result of such Certificateholder's failure to surrender its Certificate(s) for final payment thereof in accordance with the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.  Such funds held by the Certificate Administrator may be invested under certain circumstances, and all income and gain realized from investment of such funds shall accrue for its benefit.



 This Certificate is limited in right of payment to, among other things, certain collections and recoveries in respect of the Mortgage Loans, as more specifically set forth herein and in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.



 As provided in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, the Trust Fund includes (in each case and to the extent of the Trust Fund's interest therein and specifically excluding any interest of any Serviced Companion Loan Noteholder therein) (i) such Mortgage Loans as from time to time are subject to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, together with the Mortgage Files relating thereto; (ii) all scheduled or unscheduled payments on or collections in respect of the Mortgage Loans due after the Cut-off Date; (iii) the Trust Fund's interest in any REO Property; (iv) all revenues received in respect of any REO Property; (v) any Assignments of Leases, Rents and Profits and any security agreements related to the Mortgage Loans; (vi) any indemnities or guaranties given as additional security for any Mortgage Loans; (vii) a security interest in all assets deposited in the Lock-Box Accounts, Cash Collateral Accounts, Escrow Accounts and Reserve Accounts; (viii) the Loss of Value Reserve Fund; (ix) the Collection Account, the Serviced Loan Combination Collection Accounts, the Distribution Accounts, any Excess Liquidation Proceeds Account, the Interest Reserve Account and the Trust's interest in any REO Account, including any amounts on deposit therein, assets credited thereto and any







 reinvestment income, as applicable; (x) a security interest in any environmental indemnity agreements relating to the Mortgaged Properties; (xi) a security interest in all insurance policies with respect to the Mortgage Loans and the Mortgaged Properties; (xii) the rights and remedies under the Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreements relating to document delivery requirements with respect to the Mortgage Loans and the representations and warranties of the related Mortgage Loan Seller regarding its Mortgage Loans; (xiii) the Lower-Tier Regular Interests and the Class EC Regular Interests and (xiv) the proceeds of the foregoing (other than any interest earned on deposits in the Lock-Box Accounts, Cash Collateral Accounts, Escrow Accounts and any Reserve Accounts, to the extent such interest belongs to the related Borrower).  As provided in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, withdrawals may be made from certain of the above-accounts for purposes other than distributions to Certificateholders.



 This Certificate does not purport to summarize the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, and reference is made to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement for the interests, rights, benefits, obligations and duties evidenced hereby, and the limitations thereon, and the rights, duties and immunities of the Certificate Administrator.



 As provided in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement and subject to certain limitations set forth therein, this Certificate is transferable or exchangeable only upon surrender of this Certificate to the Certificate Registrar at its offices together with an assignment and transfer (executed by the Holder or his duly authorized attorney), subject to the requirements in Article V of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.  Upon surrender for registration of transfer of this Certificate, subject to the requirements Article V of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, the Certificate Administrator shall execute and the Authenticating Agent shall duly authenticate in the name of the designated transferee or transferees, one or more new Certificates in authorized denominations of a like aggregate denomination as the Certificate being surrendered.  Such Certificates shall be delivered by the Certificate Registrar in accordance with Article V of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.

 No fee or service charge shall be imposed by the Certificate Registrar for its services in respect of any registration of transfer or exchange referred to in Section 5.02 of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement other than for transfers to Institutional Accredited Investors as provided in Section 5.02(h) of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.  In connection with any transfer to an Institutional Accredited Investor, the transferor shall reimburse the Trust Fund for any costs (including the cost of the Certificate Registrar's counsel's review of the documents and any legal opinions, submitted by the transferor or transferee to the Certificate Registrar as provided in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement) incurred by the Certificate Registrar in connection with such transfer.  The Certificate Registrar may require payment by each transferor







 of a sum sufficient to cover any tax, expense or other governmental charge payable in connection with any such transfer.



 The Pooling and Servicing Agreement or any Custodial Agreement may be amended at any time by the Depositor, the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Certificate Administrator, the Operating Advisor and the Trustee without the consent of any of the Certificateholders or Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders, (i) to cure any ambiguity or to correct any error; (ii) to cause the provisions of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement or any Custodial Agreement to conform or be consistent with or in furtherance of the statements made in the Prospectus or Private Placement Memorandum with respect to the Certificates, the Trust or the Pooling and Servicing Agreement or to correct or supplement any provisions herein or therein which may be defective or inconsistent with any other provisions herein or therein; (iii) to amend any provision of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement or any Custodial Agreement to the extent necessary or desirable to maintain the rating or ratings assigned to each of the Classes of Certificates or any Class of Serviced Companion Loan Securities by each Rating Agency; provided, that such amendment does not reduce the consent or consultation rights of the Controlling Class Representative or the right of the Controlling Class Representative to receive information under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement; (iv) to amend or supplement a provision, or to supplement any other provisions to the extent not inconsistent with the provisions of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, or to effect any other change, in each case which will not adversely affect in any material respect the interests of any Certificateholder or Serviced Companion Loan Noteholder not consenting thereto, as evidenced in writing by an Opinion of Counsel or, if solely affecting any Certificateholder of a rated Class or Serviced Companion Loan Noteholder, in respect of which a No Downgrade Confirmation has been obtained relating to the Certificates of a rated Class and Serviced Companion Loan Securities, if any; (v) to modify the procedures in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement relating to compliance with Rule 17g-5 of the Exchange Act; and (vi) in the event of a TIA Applicability Determination, to modify, eliminate or add to the provisions of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement (A) to the extent necessary to effect the qualification of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement under the TIA or under any similar federal statute hereafter enacted and to add to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement such other provisions as may be expressly required by the TIA, and (B) to modify such other provisions of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement to the extent necessary to make those provisions consistent with, and conform to, the modifications made pursuant to clause (A); provided that any amendment pursuant to this clause (vi) shall be at the sole cost and expense of the Depositor.  Such amendment (a) shall not materially increase the obligations of the Depositor, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Certificate Administrator, the Operating Advisor, the 17g-5 Information Provider, the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer without such party's consent; and (b) shall not adversely affect in any material respect the interests of any Certificateholder or Serviced Companion Loan Noteholder not consenting thereto, as evidenced in the case of clauses (iii) through (v) above by (x) an Opinion of Counsel or (y) solely in the case of a Certificateholder of a rated Class, receipt of a No Downgrade Confirmation from each applicable Rating Agency.  In no event shall any such amendment cause the Lower-Tier REMIC or the Upper-Tier REMIC to fail to qualify as a REMIC or the Grantor Trust to fail to qualify as a grantor trust or to significantly change the activities of the Trust.



 The Pooling and Servicing Agreement or any Custodial Agreement may also be amended from time to time by the Depositor, the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the







 Certificate Administrator, the Operating Advisor and the Trustee with the prior written consent of the Holders of Certificates representing not less than 66-2/3% of the Percentage Interests of each Class of Certificates affected thereby (without regard to Certificates held by the Depositor, any of the Depositor's Affiliates and/or agents) and each Serviced Companion Loan Noteholder affected thereby for the purpose of adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement or modifying in any manner the rights of the Certificateholders or the Serviced Companion Noteholders; provided, that no such amendment may:



 (i)      reduce in any manner the amount of, or delay the timing of, payments received on the Mortgage Loans or Serviced Loan Combinations which are required to be distributed on any Certificate, without the consent of the Holders of Certificates representing all of the Percentage Interests of the Class or Classes affected thereby or which are required to be distributed to any Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders without the consent of such Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders;



        (ii)   change the percentages of Voting Rights or Percentage Interests of Holders of Certificates which are required to consent to any action or inaction under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement;

 This certifies that [              ] is the registered owner of a beneficial ownership interest in a Trust Fund, including the distributions to be made with respect to the Class A-M Certificates.  The Trust Fund, described more fully below, consists primarily of a pool of Mortgage Loans secured by first liens on commercial and multifamily properties and held in trust by the Trustee and serviced by the Master Servicer.  The Trust Fund was created, and the Mortgage Loans are to be serviced, pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement (as defined below).  The Holder of this Certificate, by virtue of the acceptance hereof, assents to the terms, provisions and conditions of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement and is bound thereby.



 The Pooling and Servicing Agreement, dated as of November 1, 2013 (the "Pooling and Servicing Agreement"), among the Depositor, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as master servicer (the "Master Servicer"), LNR Partners, LLC, as special servicer (the "Special Servicer"), Park Bridge Lender Services LLC, as operating advisor (the "Operating Advisor"), UxxPDSxxPD Bank National Association, as trustee (the "Trustee"), and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as certificate administrator (the "Certificate Administrator"), paying agent and custodian, evidences the issuance of the Class A-1, Class A-2, Class A-3, Class A-4, Class A-SB, Class A-M, Class B, Class PEZ, Class C, Class X-A, Class X-B, Class X-C, Class D, Class E, Class F, Class G, Class V, Class R and Class LR Certificates (the "Certificates"; the Holders of Certificates issued under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement are collectively referred to herein as "Certificateholders").  This Certificate is issued pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.  To the extent not defined







 herein, capitalized terms used herein shall have the meanings assigned thereto in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.



 This Certificate represents a beneficial interest in a portion of a grantor trust under subpart E, part I of subchapter J of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), which portion includes a percentage interest in the Class A-M Regular Interest, a "regular interest" in a "real estate mortgage investment conduit", as those terms are defined, respectively, in Sections 860G(a)(1) and 860D of the Code.  Each Holder of this Certificate, by acceptance hereof, agrees to treat, and take no action inconsistent with the treatment of, this Certificate in accordance with the preceding sentence for purposes of federal income taxes, state and local income and franchise taxes and other taxes imposed on or measured by income.



 The Certificate Administrator makes no representation or warranty as to any of the statements contained herein or the validity or sufficiency of the Certificates or the Mortgage Loans and has executed this Certificate in its limited capacity as Certificate Administrator under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.



 Pursuant to the terms of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, the Certificate Administrator, or the Paying Agent on behalf of the Certificate Administrator, will distribute (other than the final distribution on any Certificate), on the fourth Business Day after each Determination Date (each such date, a "Distribution Date") an amount equal to such Person's pro rata share (based on the Percentage Interest represented by this Certificate) of that portion of the aggregate amount of principal and interest then distributable, if any, allocable to the Class A-M Certificates for such Distribution Date, all as more fully described in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.  "Determination Date" is defined in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement as the sixth day of each month, or if such sixth day is not a Business Day, then the next Business Day, commencing in December 2013.  Holders of this Certificate may be entitled to Prepayment Premiums and Yield Maintenance Charges as provided in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.



 During each Interest Accrual Period (as defined below), interest on the Class A-M Certificates will be calculated based on a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months on the outstanding Certificate Balance hereof.



 Interest accrued on this Certificate during an Interest Accrual Period, plus the aggregate unpaid Interest Shortfall with respect to this Certificate, if any, will be payable on the related Distribution Date to the extent provided in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.  The "Interest Accrual Period" means, with respect to any Distribution Date, the calendar month immediately preceding the month in which such Distribution Date occurs.  Each Interest Accrual Period is assumed to consist of 30 days.



 All distributions (other than the final distribution on any Certificate) will be made by the Paying Agent to the Persons in whose names the Certificates are registered at the close of business on each Record Date, which will be the close of business on the last Business Day of the calendar month preceding the month in which such Distribution Date occurs; provided that with respect to the Distribution Date occurring in December 2013, the Record Date will be the Closing Date.  Such distributions shall be made on each Distribution Date other than the Termination Date to each Certificateholder of record on the related Record Date, by wire transfer







 of immediately available funds to the account of such Holder at a bank or other entity located in the United States and having appropriate facilities therefor if such Holder shall have provided the Paying Agent with wire instructions in writing at least five Business Days prior to the related Record Date, or, otherwise, by check mailed by first-class mail to the address set forth therefor in the Certificate Register.  The final distribution on each Certificate shall be made in like manner, but only upon presentment and surrender of such Certificate at the office of the Certificate Administrator or its agent (which may be the Paying Agent or the Certificate Registrar acting as such agent) that is specified in the notice to Holders of such final distribution.



 Any funds not distributed on the Termination Date because of the failure of any Certificateholders to tender their Certificates shall, on such date, be set aside and held in trust for the benefit of the appropriate non-tendering Certificateholders.  If any Certificates as to which notice of the Termination Date has been given pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement shall not have been surrendered for cancellation within six months after the time specified in such notice, the Certificate Administrator shall mail a second notice to the remaining non-tendering Certificateholders, at their last addresses shown in the Certificate Register, to surrender their Certificates for cancellation in order to receive, from such funds held, the final distribution with respect thereto.  If within one year after the second notice not all of such Certificates shall have been surrendered for cancellation, the Certificate Administrator may, directly or through an agent, take appropriate steps to contact the remaining non-tendering Certificateholders concerning surrender of their Certificates.  The costs and expenses of holding such funds in trust and of contacting such Certificateholders shall be paid out of such funds.  If within two years after the second notice any such Certificates shall not have been surrendered for cancellation, the Paying Agent shall pay to the Certificate Administrator all amounts distributable to the Holders thereof, and the Certificate Administrator shall thereafter hold such amounts for the benefit of such Holders until the earlier of (i) its termination as Certificate Administrator under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement and the transfer of such amounts to a successor certificate administrator and (ii) the termination of the Trust Fund and distribution of such amounts to the Residual Certificateholders.  No interest shall accrue or be payable to any Certificateholder on any amount held as a result of such Certificateholder's failure to surrender its Certificate(s) for final payment thereof in accordance with the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.  Such funds held by the Certificate Administrator may be invested under certain circumstances, and all income and gain realized from investment of such funds shall accrue for its benefit.



 This Certificate is limited in right of payment to, among other things, certain collections and recoveries in respect of the Mortgage Loans, as more specifically set forth herein and in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.



 As provided in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, the Trust Fund includes (in each case and to the extent of the Trust Fund's interest therein and specifically excluding any interest of any Serviced Companion Loan Noteholder therein) (i) such Mortgage Loans as from time to time are subject to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, together with the Mortgage Files relating thereto; (ii) all scheduled or unscheduled payments on or collections in respect of the Mortgage Loans due after the Cut-off Date; (iii) the Trust Fund's interest in any REO Property; (iv) all revenues received in respect of any REO Property; (v) any Assignments of Leases, Rents and Profits and any security agreements related to the Mortgage Loans; (vi) any

As provided in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, withdrawals may be made from certain of the above-accounts for purposes other than distributions to Certificateholders.



 This Certificate does not purport to summarize the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, and reference is made to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement for the interests, rights, benefits, obligations and duties evidenced hereby, and the limitations thereon, and the rights, duties and immunities of the Certificate Administrator.

 No fee or service charge shall be imposed by the Certificate Registrar for its services in respect of any registration of transfer or exchange referred to in Section 5.02 of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement other than for transfers to Institutional Accredited Investors as provided in Section 5.02(h) of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.  In connection with any







 transfer to an Institutional Accredited Investor, the transferor shall reimburse the Trust Fund for any costs (including the cost of the Certificate Registrar's counsel's review of the documents and any legal opinions, submitted by the transferor or transferee to the Certificate Registrar as provided in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement) incurred by the Certificate Registrar in connection with such transfer.  The Certificate Registrar may require payment by each transferor of a sum sufficient to cover any tax, expense or other governmental charge payable in connection with any such transfer.



 The Pooling and Servicing Agreement or any Custodial Agreement may be amended at any time by the Depositor, the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Certificate Administrator, the Operating Advisor and the Trustee without the consent of any of the Certificateholders or Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders, (i) to cure any ambiguity or to correct any error; (ii) to cause the provisions of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement or any Custodial Agreement to conform or be consistent with or in furtherance of the statements made in the Prospectus or Private Placement Memorandum with respect to the Certificates, the Trust or the Pooling and Servicing Agreement or to correct or supplement any provisions herein or therein which may be defective or inconsistent with any other provisions herein or therein; (iii) to amend any provision of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement or any Custodial Agreement to the extent necessary or desirable to maintain the rating or ratings assigned to each of the Classes of Certificates or any Class of Serviced Companion Loan Securities by each Rating Agency; provided, that such amendment does not reduce the consent or consultation rights of the Controlling Class Representative or the right of the Controlling Class Representative to receive information under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement; (iv) to amend or supplement a provision, or to supplement any other provisions to the extent not inconsistent with the provisions of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, or to effect any other change, in each case which will not adversely affect in any material respect the interests of any Certificateholder or Serviced Companion Loan Noteholder not consenting thereto, as evidenced in writing by an Opinion of Counsel or, if solely affecting any Certificateholder of a rated Class or Serviced Companion Loan Noteholder, in respect of which a No Downgrade Confirmation has been obtained relating to the Certificates of a rated Class and Serviced Companion Loan Securities, if any; (v) to modify the procedures in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement relating to compliance with Rule 17g-5 of the Exchange Act; and (vi) in the event of a TIA Applicability Determination, to modify, eliminate or add to the provisions of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement (A) to the extent necessary to effect the qualification of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement under the TIA or under any similar federal statute hereafter enacted and to add to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement such other provisions as may be expressly required by the TIA, and (B) to modify such other provisions of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement to the extent necessary to make those provisions consistent with, and conform to, the modifications made pursuant to clause (A); provided that any amendment pursuant to this clause (vi) shall be at the sole cost and expense of the Depositor.  Such amendment (a) shall not materially increase the obligations of the Depositor, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Certificate Administrator, the Operating Advisor, the 17g-5 Information Provider, the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer without such party's consent; and (b) shall not adversely affect in any material respect the interests of any Certificateholder or Serviced Companion Loan Noteholder not consenting thereto, as evidenced in the case of clauses (iii) through (v) above by (x) an Opinion of Counsel or (y) solely in the case of a Certificateholder of a rated Class, receipt of a No Downgrade Confirmation from each applicable Rating Agency.  In no event shall any such amendment cause







 the Lower-Tier REMIC or the Upper-Tier REMIC to fail to qualify as a REMIC or the Grantor Trust to fail to qualify as a grantor trust or to significantly change the activities of the Trust.



 The Pooling and Servicing Agreement or any Custodial Agreement may also be amended from time to time by the Depositor, the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Certificate Administrator, the Operating Advisor and the Trustee with the prior written consent of the Holders of Certificates representing not less than 66-2/3% of the Percentage Interests of each Class of Certificates affected thereby (without regard to Certificates held by the Depositor, any of the Depositor's Affiliates and/or agents) and each Serviced Companion Loan Noteholder affected thereby for the purpose of adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement or modifying in any manner the rights of the Certificateholders or the Serviced Companion Noteholders; provided, that no such amendment may:



        (i)   reduce in any manner the amount of, or delay the timing of, payments received on the Mortgage Loans or Serviced Loan Combinations which are required to be distributed on any Certificate, without the consent of the Holders of Certificates representing all of the Percentage Interests of the Class or Classes affected thereby or which are required to be distributed to any Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders without the consent of such Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders;



        (ii)   change the percentages of Voting Rights or Percentage Interests of Holders of Certificates which are required to consent to any action or inaction under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement;



        (iii)   alter the Servicing Standard, the Operating Advisor Standard or obligations of the Master Servicer or the Trustee to make a P&I Advance or a Property Advance, without the consent of the Holders of Certificates representing all of the Percentage Interests of the Class or Classes affected thereby and the consent of any affected Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders; or



        (iv)   amend any section hereof which relates to the amendment of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement without the consent of the Holders of all Certificates representing all of the Percentage Interests of the Class or Classes affected thereby and the consent of any affected Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders.



 Further, the Depositor, the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Certificate Administrator, the Operating Advisor and the Trustee, at any time and from time to time, without the consent of the Certificateholders or, if applicable, the Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders, may amend the Pooling and Servicing Agreement to modify, eliminate or add to any of its provisions (i) to such extent as shall be necessary to maintain the qualification of the Lower-Tier REMIC or the Upper-Tier REMIC as a REMIC or the qualification of the Grantor Trust as a grantor trust, or to prevent the imposition of any additional material state or local taxes, at all times that any Certificates are outstanding; provided, that such action, as evidenced







 by an Opinion of Counsel (obtained at the expense of the Trust Fund), is necessary or helpful to maintain such qualification or to prevent the imposition of any such taxes, and would not adversely affect in any material respect the interest of any Certificateholder or, if applicable, any Serviced Companion Loan Noteholder or (ii) to the extent necessary to comply with the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, the Exchange Act, Regulation AB, and/or any related regulatory actions and/or interpretations.



 The Certificateholder owning a majority of the Percentage Interests in the Controlling Class and, if no such Certificateholder exercises such option, the Special Servicer, and if the Special Servicer does not exercise such option, the Master Servicer, may effect an early termination of the Trust Fund, upon not less than 30 days' prior Notice of Termination given to the Trustee, the Special Servicer and the Master Servicer any time on or after the Early Termination Notice Date (defined as any date as of which the aggregate Stated Principal Balance of the Mortgage Loans is less than 1.0% of the aggregate Stated Principal Balance of the Mortgage Loans as of the Cut-off Date) specifying the Anticipated Termination Date, by purchasing on such date all, but not less than all, of the Mortgage Loans then included in the Trust Fund, and the Trust's interest in all property acquired in respect of any Mortgage Loan, at a purchase price, payable in cash, equal to the sum of, without duplication:



        (A)   100% of the Stated Principal Balance of each Mortgage Loan included in the Trust Fund as of the last day of the month preceding such Anticipated Termination Date (less any P&I Advances previously made on account of principal);



        (B)   the fair market value of all other property included in the Trust Fund as of the last day of the month preceding such Anticipated Termination Date, as determined by an Independent appraiser acceptable to the Master Servicer as of a date not more than 30 days prior to the last day of the month preceding such Distribution Date;



        (C)   all unpaid interest accrued on the unpaid balance of each Mortgage Loan (including any Mortgage Loan as to which title to the related Mortgaged Property has been acquired) at the Mortgage Rate to the last day of the month preceding such Anticipated Termination Date (less any P&I Advances previously made on account of interest); and



        (D)   the aggregate amount of unreimbursed Advances, with interest thereon at the Advance Rate, and unpaid Servicing Compensation, Special Servicing Compensation, Operating Advisor Fees, Trustee/Certificate Administrator Fees, the CREFC® License Fees and Trust Fund expenses.



 In addition, the Pooling and Servicing Agreement provides that following the date on which the Class X-A Notional Amount and the aggregate Certificate Balance of the Class A-1, Class A-2, Class A-3, Class A-4, Class A-SB, Class A-M, Class B, Class PEZ, Class C and

 This certifies that [              ] is the registered owner of a beneficial ownership interest in a Trust Fund, including the distributions to be made with respect to the Class B Certificates.  The Trust Fund, described more fully below, consists primarily of a pool of Mortgage Loans secured by first liens on commercial and multifamily properties and held in trust by the Trustee and serviced by the Master Servicer.  The Trust Fund was created, and the Mortgage Loans are to be serviced, pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement (as defined below).  The Holder of this Certificate, by virtue of the acceptance hereof, assents to the terms, provisions and conditions of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement and is bound thereby.



 The Pooling and Servicing Agreement, dated as of November 1, 2013 (the "Pooling and Servicing Agreement"), among the Depositor, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as master servicer (the "Master Servicer"), LNR Partners, LLC, as special servicer (the "Special Servicer"), Park Bridge Lender Services LLC, as operating advisor (the "Operating Advisor"), UxxPDSxxPD Bank National Association, as trustee (the "Trustee"), and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as certificate administrator (the "Certificate Administrator"), paying agent and custodian, evidences the issuance of the Class A-1, Class A-2, Class A-3, Class A-4, Class A-SB, Class A-M, Class B, Class PEZ, Class C, Class X-A, Class X-B, Class X-C, Class D, Class E, Class F, Class G, Class V, Class R and Class LR Certificates (the "Certificates"; the Holders of Certificates issued under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement are collectively referred to herein as "Certificateholders").  This Certificate is issued pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.  To the extent not defined







 herein, capitalized terms used herein shall have the meanings assigned thereto in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.



 This Certificate represents a beneficial interest in a portion of a grantor trust under subpart E, part I of subchapter J of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), which portion includes a percentage interest in the Class B Regular Interest, a "regular interest" in a "real estate mortgage investment conduit", as those terms are defined, respectively, in Sections 860G(a)(1) and 860D of the Code.  Each Holder of this Certificate, by acceptance hereof, agrees to treat, and take no action inconsistent with the treatment of, this Certificate in accordance with the preceding sentence for purposes of federal income taxes, state and local income and franchise taxes and other taxes imposed on or measured by income.



 The Certificate Administrator makes no representation or warranty as to any of the statements contained herein or the validity or sufficiency of the Certificates or the Mortgage Loans and has executed this Certificate in its limited capacity as Certificate Administrator under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.



 Pursuant to the terms of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, the Certificate Administrator, or the Paying Agent on behalf of the Certificate Administrator, will distribute (other than the final distribution on any Certificate), on the fourth Business Day after each Determination Date (each such date, a "Distribution Date") an amount equal to such Person's pro rata share (based on the Percentage Interest represented by this Certificate) of that portion of the aggregate amount of principal and interest then distributable, if any, allocable to the Class B Certificates for such Distribution Date, all as more fully described in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.  "Determination Date" is defined in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement as the sixth day of each month, or if such sixth day is not a Business Day, then the next Business Day, commencing in December 2013.  Holders of this Certificate may be entitled to Prepayment Premiums and Yield Maintenance Charges as provided in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.



 During each Interest Accrual Period (as defined below), interest on the Class B Certificates will be calculated based on a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months on the outstanding Certificate Balance hereof.



 Interest accrued on this Certificate during an Interest Accrual Period, plus the aggregate unpaid Interest Shortfall with respect to this Certificate, if any, will be payable on the related Distribution Date to the extent provided in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.  The "Interest Accrual Period" means, with respect to any Distribution Date, the calendar month immediately preceding the month in which such Distribution Date occurs.  Each Interest Accrual Period is assumed to consist of 30 days.



 All distributions (other than the final distribution on any Certificate) will be made by the Paying Agent to the Persons in whose names the Certificates are registered at the close of business on each Record Date, which will be the close of business on the last Business Day of the calendar month preceding the month in which such Distribution Date occurs; provided that with respect to the Distribution Date occurring in December 2013, the Record Date will be the Closing Date.  Such distributions shall be made on each Distribution Date other than the Termination Date to each Certificateholder of record on the related Record Date, by wire transfer







 of immediately available funds to the account of such Holder at a bank or other entity located in the United States and having appropriate facilities therefor if such Holder shall have provided the Paying Agent with wire instructions in writing at least five Business Days prior to the related Record Date, or, otherwise, by check mailed by first-class mail to the address set forth therefor in the Certificate Register.  The final distribution on each Certificate shall be made in like manner, but only upon presentment and surrender of such Certificate at the office of the Certificate Administrator or its agent (which may be the Paying Agent or the Certificate Registrar acting as such agent) that is specified in the notice to Holders of such final distribution.



 Any funds not distributed on the Termination Date because of the failure of any Certificateholders to tender their Certificates shall, on such date, be set aside and held in trust for the benefit of the appropriate non-tendering Certificateholders.  If any Certificates as to which notice of the Termination Date has been given pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement shall not have been surrendered for cancellation within six months after the time specified in such notice, the Certificate Administrator shall mail a second notice to the remaining non-tendering Certificateholders, at their last addresses shown in the Certificate Register, to surrender their Certificates for cancellation in order to receive, from such funds held, the final distribution with respect thereto.  If within one year after the second notice not all of such Certificates shall have been surrendered for cancellation, the Certificate Administrator may, directly or through an agent, take appropriate steps to contact the remaining non-tendering Certificateholders concerning surrender of their Certificates.  The costs and expenses of holding such funds in trust and of contacting such Certificateholders shall be paid out of such funds.  If within two years after the second notice any such Certificates shall not have been surrendered for cancellation, the Paying Agent shall pay to the Certificate Administrator all amounts distributable to the Holders thereof, and the Certificate Administrator shall thereafter hold such amounts for the benefit of such Holders until the earlier of (i) its termination as Certificate Administrator under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement and the transfer of such amounts to a successor certificate administrator and (ii) the termination of the Trust Fund and distribution of such amounts to the Residual Certificateholders.  No interest shall accrue or be payable to any Certificateholder on any amount held as a result of such Certificateholder's failure to surrender its Certificate(s) for final payment thereof in accordance with the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.  Such funds held by the Certificate Administrator may be invested under certain circumstances, and all income and gain realized from investment of such funds shall accrue for its benefit.



 This Certificate is limited in right of payment to, among other things, certain collections and recoveries in respect of the Mortgage Loans, as more specifically set forth herein and in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.



 As provided in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, the Trust Fund includes (in each case and to the extent of the Trust Fund's interest therein and specifically excluding any interest of any Serviced Companion Loan Noteholder therein) (i) such Mortgage Loans as from time to time are subject to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, together with the Mortgage Files relating thereto; (ii) all scheduled or unscheduled payments on or collections in respect of the Mortgage Loans due after the Cut-off Date; (iii) the Trust Fund's interest in any REO Property; (iv) all revenues received in respect of any REO Property; (v) any Assignments of Leases, Rents and Profits and any security agreements related to the Mortgage Loans; (vi) any

As provided in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, withdrawals may be made from certain of the above-accounts for purposes other than distributions to Certificateholders.

Such amendment (a) shall not materially increase the obligations of the Depositor, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Certificate Administrator, the Operating Advisor, the 17g-5 Information Provider, the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer without such party's consent; and (b) shall not adversely affect in any material respect the interests of any Certificateholder or Serviced Companion Loan Noteholder not consenting thereto, as evidenced in the case of clauses (iii) through (v) above by (x) an Opinion of Counsel or (y) solely in the case of a Certificateholder of a rated Class, receipt of a No Downgrade Confirmation from each applicable Rating Agency.  In no event shall any such amendment cause







 the Lower-Tier REMIC or the Upper-Tier REMIC to fail to qualify as a REMIC or the Grantor Trust to fail to qualify as a grantor trust or to significantly change the activities of the Trust.



 The Pooling and Servicing Agreement or any Custodial Agreement may also be amended from time to time by the Depositor, the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Certificate Administrator, the Operating Advisor and the Trustee with the prior written consent of the Holders of Certificates representing not less than 66-2/3% of the Percentage Interests of each Class of Certificates affected thereby (without regard to Certificates held by the Depositor, any of the Depositor's Affiliates and/or agents) and each Serviced Companion Loan Noteholder affected thereby for the purpose of adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement or modifying in any manner the rights of the Certificateholders or the Serviced Companion Noteholders; provided, that no such amendment may:



        (i)   reduce in any manner the amount of, or delay the timing of, payments received on the Mortgage Loans or Serviced Loan Combinations which are required to be distributed on any Certificate, without the consent of the Holders of Certificates representing all of the Percentage Interests of the Class or Classes affected thereby or which are required to be distributed to any Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders without the consent of such Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders;



        (ii)   change the percentages of Voting Rights or Percentage Interests of Holders of Certificates which are required to consent to any action or inaction under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement;



        (iii)   alter the Servicing Standard, the Operating Advisor Standard or obligations of the Master Servicer or the Trustee to make a P&I Advance or a Property Advance, without the consent of the Holders of Certificates representing all of the Percentage Interests of the Class or Classes affected thereby and the consent of any affected Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders; or



        (iv)   amend any section hereof which relates to the amendment of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement without the consent of the Holders of all Certificates representing all of the Percentage Interests of the Class or Classes affected thereby and the consent of any affected Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders.



 Further, the Depositor, the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Certificate Administrator, the Operating Advisor and the Trustee, at any time and from time to time, without the consent of the Certificateholders or, if applicable, the Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders, may amend the Pooling and Servicing Agreement to modify, eliminate or add to any of its provisions (i) to such extent as shall be necessary to maintain the qualification of the Lower-Tier REMIC or the Upper-Tier REMIC as a REMIC or the qualification of the Grantor Trust as a grantor trust, or to prevent the imposition of any additional material state or local taxes, at all times that any Certificates are outstanding; provided, that such action, as evidenced







 by an Opinion of Counsel (obtained at the expense of the Trust Fund), is necessary or helpful to maintain such qualification or to prevent the imposition of any such taxes, and would not adversely affect in any material respect the interest of any Certificateholder or, if applicable, any Serviced Companion Loan Noteholder or (ii) to the extent necessary to comply with the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, the Exchange Act, Regulation AB, and/or any related regulatory actions and/or interpretations.



 The Certificateholder owning a majority of the Percentage Interests in the Controlling Class and, if no such Certificateholder exercises such option, the Special Servicer, and if the Special Servicer does not exercise such option, the Master Servicer, may effect an early termination of the Trust Fund, upon not less than 30 days' prior Notice of Termination given to the Trustee, the Special Servicer and the Master Servicer any time on or after the Early Termination Notice Date (defined as any date as of which the aggregate Stated Principal Balance of the Mortgage Loans is less than 1.0% of the aggregate Stated Principal Balance of the Mortgage Loans as of the Cut-off Date) specifying the Anticipated Termination Date, by purchasing on such date all, but not less than all, of the Mortgage Loans then included in the Trust Fund, and the Trust's interest in all property acquired in respect of any Mortgage Loan, at a purchase price, payable in cash, equal to the sum of, without duplication:



        (A)   100% of the Stated Principal Balance of each Mortgage Loan included in the Trust Fund as of the last day of the month preceding such Anticipated Termination Date (less any P&I Advances previously made on account of principal);



        (B)   the fair market value of all other property included in the Trust Fund as of the last day of the month preceding such Anticipated Termination Date, as determined by an Independent appraiser acceptable to the Master Servicer as of a date not more than 30 days prior to the last day of the month preceding such Distribution Date;



        (C)   all unpaid interest accrued on the unpaid balance of each Mortgage Loan (including any Mortgage Loan as to which title to the related Mortgaged Property has been acquired) at the Mortgage Rate to the last day of the month preceding such Anticipated Termination Date (less any P&I Advances previously made on account of interest); and



        (D)   the aggregate amount of unreimbursed Advances, with interest thereon at the Advance Rate, and unpaid Servicing Compensation, Special Servicing Compensation, Operating Advisor Fees, Trustee/Certificate Administrator Fees, the CREFC® License Fees and Trust Fund expenses.

 referred to herein as "Certificateholders").  This Certificate is issued pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.  To the extent not defined herein, capitalized terms used herein shall have the meanings assigned thereto in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.



 This Certificate represents a beneficial interest in a portion of a grantor trust under subpart E, part I of subchapter J of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), which portion includes a percentage interest in the Class A-M, Class B and Class C Regular Interests, a "regular interest" in a "real estate mortgage investment conduit", as those terms are defined, respectively, in Sections 860G(a)(1) and 860D of the Code.  Each Holder of this Certificate, by acceptance hereof, agrees to treat, and take no action inconsistent with the treatment of, this Certificate in accordance with the preceding sentence for purposes of federal income taxes, state and local income and franchise taxes and other taxes imposed on or measured by income.



 The initial Certificate Balance of the Class PEZ Certificates is equal to the aggregate of the initial Class PEZ Components on the Closing Date (without giving effect to any exchanges on the Closing Date).



 The Certificate Administrator makes no representation or warranty as to any of the statements contained herein or the validity or sufficiency of the Certificates or the Mortgage Loans and has executed this Certificate in its limited capacity as Certificate Administrator under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.



 Pursuant to the terms of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, the Certificate Administrator, or the Paying Agent on behalf of the Certificate Administrator, will distribute (other than the final distribution on any Certificate), on the fourth Business Day after each Determination Date (each such date, a "Distribution Date") an amount equal to such Person's pro rata share (based on the Percentage Interest represented by this Certificate) of that portion of the aggregate amount of principal and interest then distributable, if any, allocable to the Class PEZ Components for such Distribution Date, all as more fully described in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.  "Determination Date" is defined in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement as the sixth day of each month, or if such sixth day is not a Business Day, then the next Business Day, commencing in December 2013.  Holders of this Certificate may be entitled to Prepayment Premiums and Yield Maintenance Charges as provided in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.



 The Class PEZ Certificates will only receive distributions of interest that are otherwise distributable to the Class PEZ Components.  During each Interest Accrual Period (as defined below), this Certificate will be entitled to interest that accrues on the Class PEZ Components and which will be calculated based on a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months.



 Interest accrued on the Class PEZ Components during an Interest Accrual Period, plus the aggregate unpaid Interest Shortfall with respect to the Class PEZ Components, if any, will be payable on the related Distribution Date to the extent provided in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.  The "Interest Accrual Period" means, with respect to any Distribution







 Date, the calendar month immediately preceding the month in which such Distribution Date occurs.  Each Interest Accrual Period is assumed to consist of 30 days.



 All distributions (other than the final distribution on any Certificate) will be made by the Paying Agent to the Persons in whose names the Certificates are registered at the close of business on each Record Date, which will be the close of business on the last Business Day of the calendar month preceding the month in which such Distribution Date occurs; provided that with respect to the Distribution Date occurring in December 2013, the Record Date will be the Closing Date.  Such distributions shall be made on each Distribution Date other than the Termination Date to each Certificateholder of record on the related Record Date, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account of such Holder at a bank or other entity located in the United States and having appropriate facilities therefor if such Holder shall have provided the Paying Agent with wire instructions in writing at least five Business Days prior to the related Record Date, or, otherwise, by check mailed by first-class mail to the address set forth therefor in the Certificate Register.  The final distribution on each Certificate shall be made in like manner, but only upon presentment and surrender of such Certificate at the office of the Certificate Administrator or its agent (which may be the Paying Agent or the Certificate Registrar acting as such agent) that is specified in the notice to Holders of such final distribution.



 Any funds not distributed on the Termination Date because of the failure of any Certificateholders to tender their Certificates shall, on such date, be set aside and held in trust for the benefit of the appropriate non-tendering Certificateholders.  If any Certificates as to which notice of the Termination Date has been given pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement shall not have been surrendered for cancellation within six months after the time specified in such notice, the Certificate Administrator shall mail a second notice to the remaining non-tendering Certificateholders, at their last addresses shown in the Certificate Register, to surrender their Certificates for cancellation in order to receive, from such funds held, the final distribution with respect thereto.  If within one year after the second notice not all of such Certificates shall have been surrendered for cancellation, the Certificate Administrator may, directly or through an agent, take appropriate steps to contact the remaining non-tendering Certificateholders concerning surrender of their Certificates.  The costs and expenses of holding such funds in trust and of contacting such Certificateholders shall be paid out of such funds.  If within two years after the second notice any such Certificates shall not have been surrendered for cancellation, the Paying Agent shall pay to the Certificate Administrator all amounts distributable to the Holders thereof, and the Certificate Administrator shall thereafter hold such amounts for the benefit of such Holders until the earlier of (i) its termination as Certificate Administrator under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement and the transfer of such amounts to a successor certificate administrator and (ii) the termination of the Trust Fund and distribution of such amounts to the Residual Certificateholders.  No interest shall accrue or be payable to any Certificateholder on any amount held as a result of such Certificateholder's failure to surrender its Certificate(s) for final payment thereof in accordance with the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.  Such funds held by the Certificate Administrator may be invested under certain circumstances, and all income and gain realized from investment of such funds shall accrue for its benefit.

        (i)   reduce in any manner the amount of, or delay the timing of, payments received on the Mortgage Loans or Serviced Loan Combinations which are required to be distributed on any Certificate, without the consent of the Holders of Certificates representing all of the Percentage Interests of the Class or Classes affected thereby or which are required to be distributed to any Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders without the consent of such Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders;

 During each Interest Accrual Period (as defined below), interest on the Class C Certificates will be calculated based on a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months on the outstanding Certificate Balance hereof.



 Interest accrued on this Certificate during an Interest Accrual Period, plus the aggregate unpaid Interest Shortfall with respect to this Certificate, if any, will be payable on the related Distribution Date to the extent provided in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.  The "Interest Accrual Period" means, with respect to any Distribution Date, the calendar month immediately preceding the month in which such Distribution Date occurs.  Each Interest Accrual Period is assumed to consist of 30 days.



 All distributions (other than the final distribution on any Certificate) will be made by the Paying Agent to the Persons in whose names the Certificates are registered at the close of business on each Record Date, which will be the close of business on the last Business Day of the calendar month preceding the month in which such Distribution Date occurs; provided that with respect to the Distribution Date occurring in December 2013, the Record Date will be the Closing Date.  Such distributions shall be made on each Distribution Date other than the Termination Date to each Certificateholder of record on the related Record Date, by wire transfer







 of immediately available funds to the account of such Holder at a bank or other entity located in the United States and having appropriate facilities therefor if such Holder shall have provided the Paying Agent with wire instructions in writing at least five Business Days prior to the related Record Date, or, otherwise, by check mailed by first-class mail to the address set forth therefor in the Certificate Register.  The final distribution on each Certificate shall be made in like manner, but only upon presentment and surrender of such Certificate at the office of the Certificate Administrator or its agent (which may be the Paying Agent or the Certificate Registrar acting as such agent) that is specified in the notice to Holders of such final distribution.



 Any funds not distributed on the Termination Date because of the failure of any Certificateholders to tender their Certificates shall, on such date, be set aside and held in trust for the benefit of the appropriate non-tendering Certificateholders.  If any Certificates as to which notice of the Termination Date has been given pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement shall not have been surrendered for cancellation within six months after the time specified in such notice, the Certificate Administrator shall mail a second notice to the remaining non-tendering Certificateholders, at their last addresses shown in the Certificate Register, to surrender their Certificates for cancellation in order to receive, from such funds held, the final distribution with respect thereto.  If within one year after the second notice not all of such Certificates shall have been surrendered for cancellation, the Certificate Administrator may, directly or through an agent, take appropriate steps to contact the remaining non-tendering Certificateholders concerning surrender of their Certificates.  The costs and expenses of holding such funds in trust and of contacting such Certificateholders shall be paid out of such funds.  If within two years after the second notice any such Certificates shall not have been surrendered for cancellation, the Paying Agent shall pay to the Certificate Administrator all amounts distributable to the Holders thereof, and the Certificate Administrator shall thereafter hold such amounts for the benefit of such Holders until the earlier of (i) its termination as Certificate Administrator under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement and the transfer of such amounts to a successor certificate administrator and (ii) the termination of the Trust Fund and distribution of such amounts to the Residual Certificateholders.  No interest shall accrue or be payable to any Certificateholder on any amount held as a result of such Certificateholder's failure to surrender its Certificate(s) for final payment thereof in accordance with the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.  Such funds held by the Certificate Administrator may be invested under certain circumstances, and all income and gain realized from investment of such funds shall accrue for its benefit.

Such amendment (a) shall not materially increase the obligations of the Depositor, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Certificate Administrator, the Operating Advisor, the 17g-5 Information Provider, the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer without such party's consent; and (b) shall not adversely affect in any material respect the interests of any Certificateholder or Serviced Companion Loan Noteholder not consenting thereto, as evidenced in the case of clauses (iii) through (v) above by (x) an Opinion of Counsel or (y) solely in the case of a Certificateholder of a rated Class, receipt of a No Downgrade Confirmation from each applicable Rating Agency.  In no event shall any such amendment cause







 the Lower-Tier REMIC or the Upper-Tier REMIC to fail to qualify as a REMIC or the Grantor Trust to fail to qualify as a grantor trust or to significantly change the activities of the Trust.



 The Pooling and Servicing Agreement or any Custodial Agreement may also be amended from time to time by the Depositor, the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Certificate Administrator, the Operating Advisor and the Trustee with the prior written consent of the Holders of Certificates representing not less than 66-2/3% of the Percentage Interests of each Class of Certificates affected thereby (without regard to Certificates held by the Depositor, any of the Depositor's Affiliates and/or agents) and each Serviced Companion Loan Noteholder affected thereby for the purpose of adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement or modifying in any manner the rights of the Certificateholders or the Serviced Companion Noteholders; provided, that no such amendment may:



        (i)   reduce in any manner the amount of, or delay the timing of, payments received on the Mortgage Loans or Serviced Loan Combinations which are required to be distributed on any Certificate, without the consent of the Holders of Certificates representing all of the Percentage Interests of the Class or Classes affected thereby or which are required to be distributed to any Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders without the consent of such Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders;



        (ii)   change the percentages of Voting Rights or Percentage Interests of Holders of Certificates which are required to consent to any action or inaction under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement;



        (iii)   alter the Servicing Standard, the Operating Advisor Standard or obligations of the Master Servicer or the Trustee to make a P&I Advance or a Property Advance, without the consent of the Holders of Certificates representing all of the Percentage Interests of the Class or Classes affected thereby and the consent of any affected Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders; or



        (iv)   amend any section hereof which relates to the amendment of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement without the consent of the Holders of all Certificates representing all of the Percentage Interests of the Class or Classes affected thereby and the consent of any affected Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders.



 Further, the Depositor, the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Certificate Administrator, the Operating Advisor and the Trustee, at any time and from time to time, without the consent of the Certificateholders or, if applicable, the Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders, may amend the Pooling and Servicing Agreement to modify, eliminate or add to any of its provisions (i) to such extent as shall be necessary to maintain the qualification of the Lower-Tier REMIC or the Upper-Tier REMIC as a REMIC or the qualification of the Grantor Trust as a grantor trust, or to prevent the imposition of any additional material state or local taxes, at all times that any Certificates are outstanding; provided, that such action, as evidenced







 by an Opinion of Counsel (obtained at the expense of the Trust Fund), is necessary or helpful to maintain such qualification or to prevent the imposition of any such taxes, and would not adversely affect in any material respect the interest of any Certificateholder or, if applicable, any Serviced Companion Loan Noteholder or (ii) to the extent necessary to comply with the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, the Exchange Act, Regulation AB, and/or any related regulatory actions and/or interpretations.



 The Certificateholder owning a majority of the Percentage Interests in the Controlling Class and, if no such Certificateholder exercises such option, the Special Servicer, and if the Special Servicer does not exercise such option, the Master Servicer, may effect an early termination of the Trust Fund, upon not less than 30 days' prior Notice of Termination given to the Trustee, the Special Servicer and the Master Servicer any time on or after the Early Termination Notice Date (defined as any date as of which the aggregate Stated Principal Balance of the Mortgage Loans is less than 1.0% of the aggregate Stated Principal Balance of the Mortgage Loans as of the Cut-off Date) specifying the Anticipated Termination Date, by purchasing on such date all, but not less than all, of the Mortgage Loans then included in the Trust Fund, and the Trust's interest in all property acquired in respect of any Mortgage Loan, at a purchase price, payable in cash, equal to the sum of, without duplication:



        (A)   100% of the Stated Principal Balance of each Mortgage Loan included in the Trust Fund as of the last day of the month preceding such Anticipated Termination Date (less any P&I Advances previously made on account of principal);



        (B)   the fair market value of all other property included in the Trust Fund as of the last day of the month preceding such Anticipated Termination Date, as determined by an Independent appraiser acceptable to the Master Servicer as of a date not more than 30 days prior to the last day of the month preceding such Distribution Date;



        (C)   all unpaid interest accrued on the unpaid balance of each Mortgage Loan (including any Mortgage Loan as to which title to the related Mortgaged Property has been acquired) at the Mortgage Rate to the last day of the month preceding such Anticipated Termination Date (less any P&I Advances previously made on account of interest); and



        (D)   the aggregate amount of unreimbursed Advances, with interest thereon at the Advance Rate, and unpaid Servicing Compensation, Special Servicing Compensation, Operating Advisor Fees, Trustee/Certificate Administrator Fees, the CREFC® License Fees and Trust Fund expenses.

 All costs and expenses incurred by any and all parties to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement or by the Trust Fund in connection with the purchase of the Mortgage Loans and the other assets of the Trust Fund pursuant to Section 9.01(c) of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement shall be borne by the party exercising its purchase rights thereunder.  The Trustee and the Certificate Administrator shall be entitled to rely conclusively on any determination made by an Independent appraiser pursuant to Section 9.01(c) of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.



 The respective obligations and responsibilities of the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Depositor, the Certificate Administrator, the Operating Advisor and the Trustee created by the Pooling and Servicing Agreement with respect to the Certificates (other than the obligations of the Certificate Administrator to make certain payments and to send certain notices to Certificateholders as set forth in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement) shall terminate upon payment (or provision for payment) to the Certificateholders and the Serviced Companion Loan Noteholder of all amounts held by or on behalf of the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator and the Master Servicer, as the case may be, required under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement to be so paid on the Distribution Date following the earlier to occur of (i) the purchase of the Mortgage Loans and all other property held by the Trust Fund in accordance with Section 9.01(c) of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement; (ii) the exchange by the Sole Certificateholder of its Certificates for the Mortgage Loans in accordance with Section 9.01(g) of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement; and (iii) the later of (a) the receipt or collection of the last payment due on any Mortgage Loan included in the Trust Fund, or (b) the liquidation and disposition pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement of the last asset held by the Trust Fund; provided that in no event shall the trust created by the Pooling and Servicing Agreement continue beyond the expiration of 21 years from the death of the last survivor of the descendants of Joseph P.

This Certificate is issued pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.  To the extent not defined herein, capitalized terms used herein shall have the meanings assigned thereto in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.



 This Certificate represents a "regular interest" in a "real estate mortgage investment conduit", as those terms are defined, respectively, in Sections 860G(a)(1) and 860D of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.  Each Holder of this Certificate, by acceptance hereof, agrees to treat, and take no action inconsistent with the treatment of, this Certificate in accordance with the preceding sentence for purposes of federal income taxes, state and local income and franchise taxes and other taxes imposed on or measured by income.



 The Certificate Administrator makes no representation or warranty as to any of the statements contained herein or the validity or sufficiency of the Certificates or the Mortgage Loans and has executed this Certificate in its limited capacity as Certificate Administrator under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.



 Pursuant to the terms of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, the Certificate Administrator, or the Paying Agent on behalf of the Certificate Administrator, will distribute (other than the final distribution on any Certificate), on the fourth Business Day after each Determination Date (each such date, a "Distribution Date") an amount equal to such Person's pro rata share (based on the Percentage Interest represented by this Certificate) of that portion of the aggregate amount of principal and interest then distributable, if any, allocable to the Class D Components for such Distribution Date, all as more fully described in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.  "Determination Date" is defined in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement as the sixth day of each month, or if such sixth day is not a Business Day, then the next Business Day, commencing in December 2013.  Holders of this Certificate may be entitled to Prepayment Premiums and Yield Maintenance Charges as provided in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.



 During each Interest Accrual Period (as defined below), interest on the Class D Certificates will be calculated based on a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months on the outstanding Certificate Balance hereof.



 Interest accrued on this Certificate during an Interest Accrual Period, plus the aggregate unpaid Interest Shortfall with respect to this Certificate, if any, will be payable on the related Distribution Date to the extent provided in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.  The "Interest Accrual Period" means, with respect to any Distribution Date, the calendar month immediately preceding the month in which such Distribution Date occurs.  Each Interest Accrual Period is assumed to consist of 30 days.



 All distributions (other than the final distribution on any Certificate) will be made by the Paying Agent to the Persons in whose names the Certificates are registered at the close of business on each Record Date, which will be the close of business on the last Business Day of the calendar month preceding the month in which such Distribution Date occurs; provided that







 with respect to the Distribution Date occurring in December 2013, the Record Date will be the Closing Date.  Such distributions shall be made on each Distribution Date other than the Termination Date to each Certificateholder of record on the related Record Date, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account of such Holder at a bank or other entity located in the United States and having appropriate facilities therefor if such Holder shall have provided the Paying Agent with wire instructions in writing at least five Business Days prior to the related Record Date, or, otherwise, by check mailed by first-class mail to the address set forth therefor in the Certificate Register.  The final distribution on each Certificate shall be made in like manner, but only upon presentment and surrender of such Certificate at the office of the Certificate Administrator or its agent (which may be the Paying Agent or the Certificate Registrar acting as such agent) that is specified in the notice to Holders of such final distribution.



 Any funds not distributed on the Termination Date because of the failure of any Certificateholders to tender their Certificates shall, on such date, be set aside and held in trust for the benefit of the appropriate non-tendering Certificateholders.  If any Certificates as to which notice of the Termination Date has been given pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement shall not have been surrendered for cancellation within six months after the time specified in such notice, the Certificate Administrator shall mail a second notice to the remaining non-tendering Certificateholders, at their last addresses shown in the Certificate Register, to surrender their Certificates for cancellation in order to receive, from such funds held, the final distribution with respect thereto.  If within one year after the second notice not all of such Certificates shall have been surrendered for cancellation, the Certificate Administrator may, directly or through an agent, take appropriate steps to contact the remaining non-tendering Certificateholders concerning surrender of their Certificates.  The costs and expenses of holding such funds in trust and of contacting such Certificateholders shall be paid out of such funds.  If within two years after the second notice any such Certificates shall not have been surrendered for cancellation, the Paying Agent shall pay to the Certificate Administrator all amounts distributable to the Holders thereof, and the Certificate Administrator shall thereafter hold such amounts for the benefit of such Holders until the earlier of (i) its termination as Certificate Administrator under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement and the transfer of such amounts to a successor certificate administrator and (ii) the termination of the Trust Fund and distribution of such amounts to the Residual Certificateholders.  No interest shall accrue or be payable to any Certificateholder on any amount held as a result of such Certificateholder's failure to surrender its Certificate(s) for final payment thereof in accordance with the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.  Such funds held by the Certificate Administrator may be invested under certain circumstances, and all income and gain realized from investment of such funds shall accrue for its benefit.

Such amendment (a) shall not materially increase the obligations of the Depositor, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Certificate Administrator, the Operating Advisor, the 17g-5 Information Provider, the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer without such party's consent; and (b) shall not adversely affect in any material respect the







 interests of any Certificateholder or Serviced Companion Loan Noteholder not consenting thereto, as evidenced in the case of clauses (iii) through (v) above by (x) an Opinion of Counsel or (y) solely in the case of a Certificateholder of a rated Class, receipt of a No Downgrade Confirmation from each applicable Rating Agency.  In no event shall any such amendment cause the Lower-Tier REMIC or the Upper-Tier REMIC to fail to qualify as a REMIC or the Grantor Trust to fail to qualify as a grantor trust or to significantly change the activities of the Trust.



 The Pooling and Servicing Agreement or any Custodial Agreement may also be amended from time to time by the Depositor, the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Certificate Administrator, the Operating Advisor and the Trustee with the prior written consent of the Holders of Certificates representing not less than 66-2/3% of the Percentage Interests of each Class of Certificates affected thereby (without regard to Certificates held by the Depositor, any of the Depositor's Affiliates and/or agents) and each Serviced Companion Loan Noteholder affected thereby for the purpose of adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement or modifying in any manner the rights of the Certificateholders or the Serviced Companion Noteholders; provided, that no such amendment may:



        (i)   reduce in any manner the amount of, or delay the timing of, payments received on the Mortgage Loans or Serviced Loan Combinations which are required to be distributed on any Certificate, without the consent of the Holders of Certificates representing all of the Percentage Interests of the Class or Classes affected thereby or which are required to be distributed to any Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders without the consent of such Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders;



        (ii)   change the percentages of Voting Rights or Percentage Interests of Holders of Certificates which are required to consent to any action or inaction under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement;



        (iii)   alter the Servicing Standard, the Operating Advisor Standard or obligations of the Master Servicer or the Trustee to make a P&I Advance or a Property Advance, without the consent of the Holders of Certificates representing all of the Percentage Interests of the Class or Classes affected thereby and the consent of any affected Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders; or



        (iv)   amend any section hereof which relates to the amendment of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement without the consent of the Holders of all Certificates representing all of the Percentage Interests of the Class or Classes affected thereby and the consent of any affected Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders.



 Further, the Depositor, the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Certificate Administrator, the Operating Advisor and the Trustee, at any time and from time to time, without the consent of the Certificateholders or, if applicable, the Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders, may amend the Pooling and Servicing Agreement to modify, eliminate or add to any of its provisions (i) to such extent as shall be necessary to maintain the qualification of the







 Lower-Tier REMIC or the Upper-Tier REMIC as a REMIC or the qualification of the Grantor Trust as a grantor trust, or to prevent the imposition of any additional material state or local taxes, at all times that any Certificates are outstanding; provided, that such action, as evidenced by an Opinion of Counsel (obtained at the expense of the Trust Fund), is necessary or helpful to maintain such qualification or to prevent the imposition of any such taxes, and would not adversely affect in any material respect the interest of any Certificateholder or, if applicable, any Serviced Companion Loan Noteholder or (ii) to the extent necessary to comply with the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, the Exchange Act, Regulation AB, and/or any related regulatory actions and/or interpretations.

        (A)   100% of the Stated Principal Balance of each Mortgage Loan included in the Trust Fund as of the last day of the month preceding such Anticipated Termination Date (less any P&I Advances previously made on account of principal);



        (B)   the fair market value of all other property included in the Trust Fund as of the last day of the month preceding such Anticipated Termination Date, as determined by an Independent appraiser acceptable to the Master Servicer as of a date not more than 30 days prior to the last day of the month preceding such Distribution Date;



        (C)   all unpaid interest accrued on the unpaid balance of each Mortgage Loan (including any Mortgage Loan as to which title to the related Mortgaged Property has been acquired) at the Mortgage Rate to the last day of the month preceding such Anticipated Termination Date (less any P&I Advances previously made on account of interest); and



        (D)   the aggregate amount of unreimbursed Advances, with interest thereon at the Advance Rate, and unpaid Servicing Compensation, Special Servicing Compensation, Operating Advisor Fees, Trustee/Certificate Administrator Fees, the CREFC® License Fees and Trust Fund expenses.

 All costs and expenses incurred by any and all parties to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement or by the Trust Fund in connection with the purchase of the Mortgage Loans and the other assets of the Trust Fund pursuant to Section 9.01(c) of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement shall be borne by the party exercising its purchase rights thereunder.  The Trustee and the Certificate Administrator shall be entitled to rely conclusively on any determination made by an Independent appraiser pursuant to Section 9.01(c) of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.



 The respective obligations and responsibilities of the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Depositor, the Certificate Administrator, the Operating Advisor and the Trustee created by the Pooling and Servicing Agreement with respect to the Certificates (other than the obligations of the Certificate Administrator to make certain payments and to send certain notices to Certificateholders as set forth in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement) shall terminate upon payment (or provision for payment) to the Certificateholders and the Serviced Companion Loan Noteholder of all amounts held by or on behalf of the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator and the Master Servicer, as the case may be, required under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement to be so paid on the Distribution Date following the earlier to occur of (i) the purchase of the Mortgage Loans and all other property held by the Trust Fund in accordance with Section 9.01(c) of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement; (ii) the exchange by the Sole Certificateholder of its Certificates for the Mortgage Loans in accordance with Section 9.01(g) of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement; and (iii) the later of (a) the receipt or collection of the last payment due on any Mortgage Loan included in the Trust Fund, or (b) the liquidation and disposition pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement of the last asset held by the Trust Fund; provided that in no event shall the trust created by the Pooling and Servicing Agreement continue beyond the expiration of 21 years from the death of the last survivor of the descendants of Joseph P.

If within one year after the second notice not all of such Certificates shall have been surrendered for cancellation, the Certificate Administrator may, directly or through an agent, take appropriate steps to contact the remaining non-tendering Certificateholders concerning surrender of their Certificates.  The costs and expenses of holding such funds in trust and of contacting such Certificateholders shall be paid out of such funds.  If within two years after the second notice any such Certificates shall not have been surrendered for cancellation, the Paying Agent shall pay to the Certificate Administrator all amounts distributable to the Holders thereof, and the Certificate Administrator shall thereafter hold such amounts for the benefit of such Holders until the earlier of (i) its termination as Certificate Administrator under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement and the transfer of such amounts to a successor certificate administrator and (ii) the termination of the Trust Fund and distribution of such amounts to the Residual Certificateholders.

Such funds held by the Certificate Administrator may be invested under certain circumstances, and all income and gain realized from investment of such funds shall accrue for its benefit.

Such amendment (a) shall not materially increase the obligations of the Depositor, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Certificate Administrator, the Operating Advisor, the 17g-5 Information Provider, the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer without such party's consent; and (b) shall not adversely affect in any material respect the interests of any Certificateholder or Serviced Companion Loan Noteholder not consenting thereto, as evidenced in the case of clauses (iii) through (v) above by (x) an Opinion of Counsel or (y) solely in the case of a Certificateholder of a rated Class, receipt of a No Downgrade Confirmation from each applicable Rating Agency.  In no event shall any such amendment cause







 the Lower-Tier REMIC or the Upper-Tier REMIC to fail to qualify as a REMIC or the Grantor Trust to fail to qualify as a grantor trust or to significantly change the activities of the Trust.



 The Pooling and Servicing Agreement or any Custodial Agreement may also be amended from time to time by the Depositor, the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Certificate Administrator, the Operating Advisor and the Trustee with the prior written consent of the Holders of Certificates representing not less than 66-2/3% of the Percentage Interests of each Class of Certificates affected thereby (without regard to Certificates held by the Depositor, any of the Depositor's Affiliates and/or agents) and each Serviced Companion Loan Noteholder affected thereby for the purpose of adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement or modifying in any manner the rights of the Certificateholders or the Serviced Companion Noteholders; provided, that no such amendment may:



        (i)   reduce in any manner the amount of, or delay the timing of, payments received on the Mortgage Loans or Serviced Loan Combinations which are required to be distributed on any Certificate, without the consent of the Holders of Certificates representing all of the Percentage Interests of the Class or Classes affected thereby or which are required to be distributed to any Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders without the consent of such Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders;



        (ii)   change the percentages of Voting Rights or Percentage Interests of Holders of Certificates which are required to consent to any action or inaction under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement;



        (iii)   alter the Servicing Standard, the Operating Advisor Standard or obligations of the Master Servicer or the Trustee to make a P&I Advance or a Property Advance, without the consent of the Holders of Certificates representing all of the Percentage Interests of the Class or Classes affected thereby and the consent of any affected Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders; or



        (iv)   amend any section hereof which relates to the amendment of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement without the consent of the Holders of all Certificates representing all of the Percentage Interests of the Class or Classes affected thereby and the consent of any affected Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders.



 Further, the Depositor, the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Certificate Administrator, the Operating Advisor and the Trustee, at any time and from time to time, without the consent of the Certificateholders or, if applicable, the Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders, may amend the Pooling and Servicing Agreement to modify, eliminate or add to any of its provisions (i) to such extent as shall be necessary to maintain the qualification of the Lower-Tier REMIC or the Upper-Tier REMIC as a REMIC or the qualification of the Grantor Trust as a grantor trust, or to prevent the imposition of any additional material state or local taxes, at all times that any Certificates are outstanding; provided, that such action, as evidenced







 by an Opinion of Counsel (obtained at the expense of the Trust Fund), is necessary or helpful to maintain such qualification or to prevent the imposition of any such taxes, and would not adversely affect in any material respect the interest of any Certificateholder or, if applicable, any Serviced Companion Loan Noteholder or (ii) to the extent necessary to comply with the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, the Exchange Act, Regulation AB, and/or any related regulatory actions and/or interpretations.

        (B)   the fair market value of all other property included in the Trust Fund as of the last day of the month preceding such Anticipated Termination Date, as determined by an Independent appraiser acceptable to the Master Servicer as of a date not more than 30 days prior to the last day of the month preceding such Distribution Date;



        (C)   all unpaid interest accrued on the unpaid balance of each Mortgage Loan (including any Mortgage Loan as to which title to the related Mortgaged Property has been acquired) at the Mortgage Rate to the last day of the month preceding such Anticipated Termination Date (less any P&I Advances previously made on account of interest); and



        (D)   the aggregate amount of unreimbursed Advances, with interest thereon at the Advance Rate, and unpaid Servicing Compensation, Special Servicing Compensation, Operating Advisor Fees, Trustee/Certificate Administrator Fees, the CREFC® License Fees and Trust Fund expenses.

The "Interest Accrual Period" means, with respect to any Distribution Date, the calendar month immediately preceding the month in which such Distribution Date occurs.  Each Interest Accrual Period is assumed to consist of 30 days.



 All distributions (other than the final distribution on any Certificate) will be made by the Paying Agent to the Persons in whose names the Certificates are registered at the close of business on each Record Date, which will be the close of business on the last Business Day of the calendar month preceding the month in which such Distribution Date occurs; provided that with respect to the Distribution Date occurring in December 2013, the Record Date will be the Closing Date.  Such distributions shall be made on each Distribution Date other than the Termination Date to each Certificateholder of record on the related Record Date, by wire transfer







 of immediately available funds to the account of such Holder at a bank or other entity located in the United States and having appropriate facilities therefor if such Holder shall have provided the Paying Agent with wire instructions in writing at least five Business Days prior to the related Record Date, or, otherwise, by check mailed by first-class mail to the address set forth therefor in the Certificate Register.  The final distribution on each Certificate shall be made in like manner, but only upon presentment and surrender of such Certificate at the office of the Certificate Administrator or its agent (which may be the Paying Agent or the Certificate Registrar acting as such agent) that is specified in the notice to Holders of such final distribution.



 Any funds not distributed on the Termination Date because of the failure of any Certificateholders to tender their Certificates shall, on such date, be set aside and held in trust for the benefit of the appropriate non-tendering Certificateholders.  If any Certificates as to which notice of the Termination Date has been given pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement shall not have been surrendered for cancellation within six months after the time specified in such notice, the Certificate Administrator shall mail a second notice to the remaining non-tendering Certificateholders, at their last addresses shown in the Certificate Register, to surrender their Certificates for cancellation in order to receive, from such funds held, the final distribution with respect thereto.  If within one year after the second notice not all of such Certificates shall have been surrendered for cancellation, the Certificate Administrator may, directly or through an agent, take appropriate steps to contact the remaining non-tendering Certificateholders concerning surrender of their Certificates.  The costs and expenses of holding such funds in trust and of contacting such Certificateholders shall be paid out of such funds.  If within two years after the second notice any such Certificates shall not have been surrendered for cancellation, the Paying Agent shall pay to the Certificate Administrator all amounts distributable to the Holders thereof, and the Certificate Administrator shall thereafter hold such amounts for the benefit of such Holders until the earlier of (i) its termination as Certificate Administrator under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement and the transfer of such amounts to a successor certificate administrator and (ii) the termination of the Trust Fund and distribution of such amounts to the Residual Certificateholders.  No interest shall accrue or be payable to any Certificateholder on any amount held as a result of such Certificateholder's failure to surrender its Certificate(s) for final payment thereof in accordance with the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.  Such funds held by the Certificate Administrator may be invested under certain circumstances, and all income and gain realized from investment of such funds shall accrue for its benefit.

Such amendment (a) shall not materially increase the obligations of the Depositor, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Certificate Administrator, the Operating Advisor, the 17g-5 Information Provider, the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer without such party's consent; and (b) shall not adversely affect in any material respect the interests of any Certificateholder or Serviced Companion Loan Noteholder not consenting thereto, as evidenced in the case of clauses (iii) through (v) above by (x) an Opinion of Counsel or (y) solely in the case of a Certificateholder of a rated Class, receipt of a No Downgrade Confirmation from each applicable Rating Agency.  In no event shall any such amendment cause







 the Lower-Tier REMIC or the Upper-Tier REMIC to fail to qualify as a REMIC or the Grantor Trust to fail to qualify as a grantor trust or to significantly change the activities of the Trust.



 The Pooling and Servicing Agreement or any Custodial Agreement may also be amended from time to time by the Depositor, the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Certificate Administrator, the Operating Advisor and the Trustee with the prior written consent of the Holders of Certificates representing not less than 66-2/3% of the Percentage Interests of each Class of Certificates affected thereby (without regard to Certificates held by the Depositor, any of the Depositor's Affiliates and/or agents) and each Serviced Companion Loan Noteholder affected thereby for the purpose of adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement or modifying in any manner the rights of the Certificateholders or the Serviced Companion Noteholders; provided, that no such amendment may:



        (i)   reduce in any manner the amount of, or delay the timing of, payments received on the Mortgage Loans or Serviced Loan Combinations which are required to be distributed on any Certificate, without the consent of the Holders of Certificates representing all of the Percentage Interests of the Class or Classes affected thereby or which are required to be distributed to any Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders without the consent of such Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders;



        (ii)   change the percentages of Voting Rights or Percentage Interests of Holders of Certificates which are required to consent to any action or inaction under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement;



        (iii)   alter the Servicing Standard, the Operating Advisor Standard or obligations of the Master Servicer or the Trustee to make a P&I Advance or a Property Advance, without the consent of the Holders of Certificates representing all of the Percentage Interests of the Class or Classes affected thereby and the consent of any affected Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders; or



        (iv)   amend any section hereof which relates to the amendment of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement without the consent of the Holders of all Certificates representing all of the Percentage Interests of the Class or Classes affected thereby and the consent of any affected Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders.



 Further, the Depositor, the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Certificate Administrator, the Operating Advisor and the Trustee, at any time and from time to time, without the consent of the Certificateholders or, if applicable, the Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders, may amend the Pooling and Servicing Agreement to modify, eliminate or add to any of its provisions (i) to such extent as shall be necessary to maintain the qualification of the Lower-Tier REMIC or the Upper-Tier REMIC as a REMIC or the qualification of the Grantor Trust as a grantor trust, or to prevent the imposition of any additional material state or local taxes, at all times that any Certificates are outstanding; provided, that such action, as evidenced







 by an Opinion of Counsel (obtained at the expense of the Trust Fund), is necessary or helpful to maintain such qualification or to prevent the imposition of any such taxes, and would not adversely affect in any material respect the interest of any Certificateholder or, if applicable, any Serviced Companion Loan Noteholder or (ii) to the extent necessary to comply with the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, the Exchange Act, Regulation AB, and/or any related regulatory actions and/or interpretations.



 The Certificateholder owning a majority of the Percentage Interests in the Controlling Class and, if no such Certificateholder exercises such option, the Special Servicer, and if the Special Servicer does not exercise such option, the Master Servicer, may effect an early termination of the Trust Fund, upon not less than 30 days' prior Notice of Termination given to the Trustee, the Special Servicer and the Master Servicer any time on or after the Early Termination Notice Date (defined as any date as of which the aggregate Stated Principal Balance of the Mortgage Loans is less than 1.0% of the aggregate Stated Principal Balance of the Mortgage Loans as of the Cut-off Date) specifying the Anticipated Termination Date, by purchasing on such date all, but not less than all, of the Mortgage Loans then included in the Trust Fund, and the Trust's interest in all property acquired in respect of any Mortgage Loan, at a purchase price, payable in cash, equal to the sum of, without duplication:



        (A)   100% of the Stated Principal Balance of each Mortgage Loan included in the Trust Fund as of the last day of the month preceding such Anticipated Termination Date (less any P&I Advances previously made on account of principal);



        (B)   the fair market value of all other property included in the Trust Fund as of the last day of the month preceding such Anticipated Termination Date, as determined by an Independent appraiser acceptable to the Master Servicer as of a date not more than 30 days prior to the last day of the month preceding such Distribution Date;



        (C)   all unpaid interest accrued on the unpaid balance of each Mortgage Loan (including any Mortgage Loan as to which title to the related Mortgaged Property has been acquired) at the Mortgage Rate to the last day of the month preceding such Anticipated Termination Date (less any P&I Advances previously made on account of interest); and



        (D)   the aggregate amount of unreimbursed Advances, with interest thereon at the Advance Rate, and unpaid Servicing Compensation, Special Servicing Compensation, Operating Advisor Fees, Trustee/Certificate Administrator Fees, the CREFC® License Fees and Trust Fund expenses.

 All costs and expenses incurred by any and all parties to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement or by the Trust Fund in connection with the purchase of the Mortgage Loans and the other assets of the Trust Fund pursuant to Section 9.01(c) of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement shall be borne by the party exercising its purchase rights thereunder.  The Trustee and the Certificate Administrator shall be entitled to rely conclusively on any determination made by an Independent appraiser pursuant to Section 9.01(c) of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.

"Determination Date" is defined in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement as the sixth day of each month, or if such sixth day is not a Business Day, then the next Business Day, commencing in December 2013.



 During each Interest Accrual Period (as defined below), interest on the Class G Certificates will be calculated based on a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months on the outstanding Certificate Balance hereof.



 Interest accrued on this Certificate during an Interest Accrual Period, plus the aggregate unpaid Interest Shortfall with respect to this Certificate, if any, will be payable on the related Distribution Date to the extent provided in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.  The "Interest Accrual Period" means, with respect to any Distribution Date, the calendar month immediately preceding the month in which such Distribution Date occurs.  Each Interest Accrual Period is assumed to consist of 30 days.



 All distributions (other than the final distribution on any Certificate) will be made by the Paying Agent to the Persons in whose names the Certificates are registered at the close of business on each Record Date, which will be the close of business on the last Business Day of the calendar month preceding the month in which such Distribution Date occurs; provided that with respect to the Distribution Date occurring in December 2013, the Record Date will be the Closing Date.  Such distributions shall be made on each Distribution Date other than the Termination Date to each Certificateholder of record on the related Record Date, by wire transfer







 of immediately available funds to the account of such Holder at a bank or other entity located in the United States and having appropriate facilities therefor if such Holder shall have provided the Paying Agent with wire instructions in writing at least five Business Days prior to the related Record Date, or, otherwise, by check mailed by first-class mail to the address set forth therefor in the Certificate Register.  The final distribution on each Certificate shall be made in like manner, but only upon presentment and surrender of such Certificate at the office of the Certificate Administrator or its agent (which may be the Paying Agent or the Certificate Registrar acting as such agent) that is specified in the notice to Holders of such final distribution.



 Any funds not distributed on the Termination Date because of the failure of any Certificateholders to tender their Certificates shall, on such date, be set aside and held in trust for the benefit of the appropriate non-tendering Certificateholders.  If any Certificates as to which notice of the Termination Date has been given pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement shall not have been surrendered for cancellation within six months after the time specified in such notice, the Certificate Administrator shall mail a second notice to the remaining non-tendering Certificateholders, at their last addresses shown in the Certificate Register, to surrender their Certificates for cancellation in order to receive, from such funds held, the final distribution with respect thereto.  If within one year after the second notice not all of such Certificates shall have been surrendered for cancellation, the Certificate Administrator may, directly or through an agent, take appropriate steps to contact the remaining non-tendering Certificateholders concerning surrender of their Certificates.  The costs and expenses of holding such funds in trust and of contacting such Certificateholders shall be paid out of such funds.  If within two years after the second notice any such Certificates shall not have been surrendered for cancellation, the Paying Agent shall pay to the Certificate Administrator all amounts distributable to the Holders thereof, and the Certificate Administrator shall thereafter hold such amounts for the benefit of such Holders until the earlier of (i) its termination as Certificate Administrator under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement and the transfer of such amounts to a successor certificate administrator and (ii) the termination of the Trust Fund and distribution of such amounts to the Residual Certificateholders.  No interest shall accrue or be payable to any Certificateholder on any amount held as a result of such Certificateholder's failure to surrender its Certificate(s) for final payment thereof in accordance with the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.  Such funds held by the Certificate Administrator may be invested under certain circumstances, and all income and gain realized from investment of such funds shall accrue for its benefit.

Such amendment (a) shall not materially increase the obligations of the Depositor, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Certificate Administrator, the Operating Advisor, the 17g-5 Information Provider, the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer without such party's consent; and (b) shall not adversely affect in any material respect the interests of any Certificateholder or Serviced Companion Loan Noteholder not consenting thereto, as evidenced in the case of clauses (iii) through (v) above by (x) an Opinion of Counsel or (y) solely in the case of a Certificateholder of a rated Class, receipt of a No Downgrade Confirmation from each applicable Rating Agency.  In no event shall any such amendment cause







 the Lower-Tier REMIC or the Upper-Tier REMIC to fail to qualify as a REMIC or the Grantor Trust to fail to qualify as a grantor trust or to significantly change the activities of the Trust.



 The Pooling and Servicing Agreement or any Custodial Agreement may also be amended from time to time by the Depositor, the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Certificate Administrator, the Operating Advisor and the Trustee with the prior written consent of the Holders of Certificates representing not less than 66-2/3% of the Percentage Interests of each Class of Certificates affected thereby (without regard to Certificates held by the Depositor, any of the Depositor's Affiliates and/or agents) and each Serviced Companion Loan Noteholder affected thereby for the purpose of adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement or modifying in any manner the rights of the Certificateholders or the Serviced Companion Noteholders; provided, that no such amendment may:



        (i)   reduce in any manner the amount of, or delay the timing of, payments received on the Mortgage Loans or Serviced Loan Combinations which are required to be distributed on any Certificate, without the consent of the Holders of Certificates representing all of the Percentage Interests of the Class or Classes affected thereby or which are required to be distributed to any Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders without the consent of such Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders;



        (ii)   change the percentages of Voting Rights or Percentage Interests of Holders of Certificates which are required to consent to any action or inaction under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement;



        (iii)   alter the Servicing Standard, the Operating Advisor Standard or obligations of the Master Servicer or the Trustee to make a P&I Advance or a Property Advance, without the consent of the Holders of Certificates representing all of the Percentage Interests of the Class or Classes affected thereby and the consent of any affected Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders; or



        (iv)   amend any section hereof which relates to the amendment of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement without the consent of the Holders of all Certificates representing all of the Percentage Interests of the Class or Classes affected thereby and the consent of any affected Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders.



 Further, the Depositor, the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Certificate Administrator, the Operating Advisor and the Trustee, at any time and from time to time, without the consent of the Certificateholders or, if applicable, the Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders, may amend the Pooling and Servicing Agreement to modify, eliminate or add to any of its provisions (i) to such extent as shall be necessary to maintain the qualification of the Lower-Tier REMIC or the Upper-Tier REMIC as a REMIC or the qualification of the Grantor Trust as a grantor trust, or to prevent the imposition of any additional material state or local taxes, at all times that any Certificates are outstanding; provided, that such action, as evidenced







 by an Opinion of Counsel (obtained at the expense of the Trust Fund), is necessary or helpful to maintain such qualification or to prevent the imposition of any such taxes, and would not adversely affect in any material respect the interest of any Certificateholder or, if applicable, any Serviced Companion Loan Noteholder or (ii) to the extent necessary to comply with the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, the Exchange Act, Regulation AB, and/or any related regulatory actions and/or interpretations.



 The Certificateholder owning a majority of the Percentage Interests in the Controlling Class and, if no such Certificateholder exercises such option, the Special Servicer, and if the Special Servicer does not exercise such option, the Master Servicer, may effect an early termination of the Trust Fund, upon not less than 30 days' prior Notice of Termination given to the Trustee, the Special Servicer and the Master Servicer any time on or after the Early Termination Notice Date (defined as any date as of which the aggregate Stated Principal Balance of the Mortgage Loans is less than 1.0% of the aggregate Stated Principal Balance of the Mortgage Loans as of the Cut-off Date) specifying the Anticipated Termination Date, by purchasing on such date all, but not less than all, of the Mortgage Loans then included in the Trust Fund, and the Trust's interest in all property acquired in respect of any Mortgage Loan, at a purchase price, payable in cash, equal to the sum of, without duplication:

        (B)   the fair market value of all other property included in the Trust Fund as of the last day of the month preceding such Anticipated Termination Date, as determined by an Independent appraiser acceptable to the Master Servicer as of a date not more than 30 days prior to the last day of the month preceding such Distribution Date;



        (C)   all unpaid interest accrued on the unpaid balance of each Mortgage Loan (including any Mortgage Loan as to which title to the related Mortgaged Property has been acquired) at the Mortgage Rate to the last day of the month preceding such Anticipated Termination Date (less any P&I Advances previously made on account of interest); and



        (D)   the aggregate amount of unreimbursed Advances, with interest thereon at the Advance Rate, and unpaid Servicing Compensation, Special Servicing Compensation, Operating Advisor Fees, Trustee/Certificate Administrator Fees, the CREFC® License Fees and Trust Fund expenses.

 All costs and expenses incurred by any and all parties to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement or by the Trust Fund in connection with the purchase of the Mortgage Loans and the other assets of the Trust Fund pursuant to Section 9.01(c) of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement shall be borne by the party exercising its purchase rights thereunder.  The Trustee and the Certificate Administrator shall be entitled to rely conclusively on any determination made by an Independent appraiser pursuant to Section 9.01(c) of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.



 The respective obligations and responsibilities of the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Depositor, the Certificate Administrator, the Operating Advisor and the Trustee created by the Pooling and Servicing Agreement with respect to the Certificates (other than the obligations of the Certificate Administrator to make certain payments and to send certain notices to Certificateholders as set forth in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement) shall terminate upon payment (or provision for payment) to the Certificateholders and the Serviced Companion Loan Noteholder of all amounts held by or on behalf of the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator and the Master Servicer, as the case may be, required under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement to be so paid on the Distribution Date following the earlier to occur of (i) the purchase of the Mortgage Loans and all other property held by the Trust Fund in accordance with Section 9.01(c) of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement; (ii) the exchange by the Sole Certificateholder of its Certificates for the Mortgage Loans in accordance with Section 9.01(g) of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement; and (iii) the later of (a) the receipt or collection of the last payment due on any Mortgage Loan included in the Trust Fund, or (b) the liquidation and disposition pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement of the last asset held by the Trust Fund; provided that in no event shall the trust created by the Pooling and Servicing Agreement continue beyond the expiration of 21 years from the death of the last survivor of the descendants of Joseph P.

 This certifies that [              ] is the registered owner of a beneficial ownership interest in a Trust Fund, including the distributions to be made with respect to the Class X-A Certificates.  The Trust Fund, described more fully below, consists primarily of a pool of Mortgage Loans secured by first liens on commercial and multifamily properties and held in trust by the Trustee and serviced by the Master Servicer.  The Trust Fund was created, and the Mortgage Loans are to be serviced, pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement (as defined below).  The Holder of this Certificate, by virtue of the acceptance hereof, assents to the terms, provisions and conditions of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement and is bound thereby.



 The Pooling and Servicing Agreement, dated as of November 1, 2013 (the "Pooling and Servicing Agreement"), among the Depositor, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as master servicer (the "Master Servicer"), LNR Partners, LLC, as special servicer (the "Special Servicer"), Park Bridge Lender Services LLC, as operating advisor (the "Operating Advisor"), UxxPDSxxPD Bank National Association, as trustee (the "Trustee"), and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as certificate administrator (the "Certificate Administrator"), paying agent and custodian, evidences the issuance of the Class A-1, Class A-2, Class A-3, Class A-4, Class A-SB, Class A-M, Class B, Class PEZ, Class C, Class X-A, Class X-B, Class X-C, Class D, Class E, Class F, Class G, Class V, Class R and Class LR Certificates (the "Certificates"; the Holders of Certificates issued under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement are collectively referred to herein as "Certificateholders").  This Certificate is issued pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.  To the extent not defined herein, capitalized terms used herein shall have the meanings assigned thereto in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.



 This Certificate represents a "regular interest" in a "real estate mortgage investment conduit", as those terms are defined, respectively, in Sections 860G(a)(1) and 860D







 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.  Each Holder of this Certificate, by acceptance hereof, agrees to treat, and take no action inconsistent with the treatment of, this Certificate in accordance with the preceding sentence for purposes of federal income taxes, state and local income and franchise taxes and other taxes imposed on or measured by income.



 The Certificate Administrator makes no representation or warranty as to any of the statements contained herein or the validity or sufficiency of the Certificates or the Mortgage Loans and has executed this Certificate in its limited capacity as Certificate Administrator under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.



 Pursuant to the terms of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, the Certificate Administrator, or the Paying Agent on behalf of the Certificate Administrator, will distribute (other than the final distribution on any Certificate), on the fourth Business Day after each Determination Date (each such date, a "Distribution Date") an amount equal to such Person's pro rata share (based on the Percentage Interest represented by this Certificate) of that portion of the aggregate amount of interest then distributable, if any, allocable to the Class X-A Certificates for such Distribution Date, all as more fully described in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.  "Determination Date" is defined in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement as the sixth day of each month, or if such sixth day is not a Business Day, then the next Business Day, commencing in December 2013.  Holders of this Certificate may be entitled to Prepayment Premiums and Yield Maintenance Charges as provided in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.



 During each Interest Accrual Period (as defined below), interest on the Class X-A Certificates will be calculated based on a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months on the outstanding Notional Balance hereof.



 Interest accrued on this Certificate during an Interest Accrual Period, plus the aggregate unpaid Interest Shortfall with respect to this Certificate, if any, will be payable on the related Distribution Date to the extent provided in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.  The "Interest Accrual Period" means, with respect to any Distribution Date, the calendar month immediately preceding the month in which such Distribution Date occurs.  Each Interest Accrual Period is assumed to consist of 30 days.



 All distributions (other than the final distribution on any Certificate) will be made by the Paying Agent to the Persons in whose names the Certificates are registered at the close of business on each Record Date, which will be the close of business on the last Business Day of the calendar month preceding the month in which such Distribution Date occurs; provided that with respect to the Distribution Date occurring in December 2013, the Record Date will be the Closing Date.  Such distributions shall be made on each Distribution Date other than the Termination Date to each Certificateholder of record on the related Record Date, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account of such Holder at a bank or other entity located in the United States and having appropriate facilities therefor if such Holder shall have provided the Paying Agent with wire instructions in writing at least five Business Days prior to the related Record Date, or, otherwise, by check mailed by first-class mail to the address set forth therefor in the Certificate Register.  The final distribution on each Certificate shall be made in like manner, but only upon presentment and surrender of such Certificate at the office of the Certificate







 Administrator or its agent (which may be the Paying Agent or the Certificate Registrar acting as such agent) that is specified in the notice to Holders of such final distribution.



 Any funds not distributed on the Termination Date because of the failure of any Certificateholders to tender their Certificates shall, on such date, be set aside and held in trust for the benefit of the appropriate non-tendering Certificateholders.  If any Certificates as to which notice of the Termination Date has been given pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement shall not have been surrendered for cancellation within six months after the time specified in such notice, the Certificate Administrator shall mail a second notice to the remaining non-tendering Certificateholders, at their last addresses shown in the Certificate Register, to surrender their Certificates for cancellation in order to receive, from such funds held, the final distribution with respect thereto.  If within one year after the second notice not all of such Certificates shall have been surrendered for cancellation, the Certificate Administrator may, directly or through an agent, take appropriate steps to contact the remaining non-tendering Certificateholders concerning surrender of their Certificates.  The costs and expenses of holding such funds in trust and of contacting such Certificateholders shall be paid out of such funds.  If within two years after the second notice any such Certificates shall not have been surrendered for cancellation, the Paying Agent shall pay to the Certificate Administrator all amounts distributable to the Holders thereof, and the Certificate Administrator shall thereafter hold such amounts for the benefit of such Holders until the earlier of (i) its termination as Certificate Administrator under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement and the transfer of such amounts to a successor certificate administrator and (ii) the termination of the Trust Fund and distribution of such amounts to the Residual Certificateholders.  No interest shall accrue or be payable to any Certificateholder on any amount held as a result of such Certificateholder's failure to surrender its Certificate(s) for final payment thereof in accordance with the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.  Such funds held by the Certificate Administrator may be invested under certain circumstances, and all income and gain realized from investment of such funds shall accrue for its benefit.

 The Pooling and Servicing Agreement or any Custodial Agreement may also be amended from time to time by the Depositor, the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the







 Certificate Administrator, the Operating Advisor and the Trustee with the prior written consent of the Holders of Certificates representing not less than 66-2/3% of the Percentage Interests of each Class of Certificates affected thereby (without regard to Certificates held by the Depositor, any of the Depositor's Affiliates and/or agents) and each Serviced Companion Loan Noteholder affected thereby for the purpose of adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement or modifying in any manner the rights of the Certificateholders or the Serviced Companion Noteholders; provided, that no such amendment may:



        (i)   reduce in any manner the amount of, or delay the timing of, payments received on the Mortgage Loans or Serviced Loan Combinations which are required to be distributed on any Certificate, without the consent of the Holders of Certificates representing all of the Percentage Interests of the Class or Classes affected thereby or which are required to be distributed to any Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders without the consent of such Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders;



        (ii)   change the percentages of Voting Rights or Percentage Interests of Holders of Certificates which are required to consent to any action or inaction under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement;

        (iv)   amend any section hereof which relates to the amendment of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement without the consent of the Holders of all Certificates representing all of the Percentage Interests of the Class or Classes affected thereby and the consent of any affected Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders.

 Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, the Exchange Act, Regulation AB, and/or any related regulatory actions and/or interpretations.

 This certifies that [              ] is the registered owner of a beneficial ownership interest in a Trust Fund, including the distributions to be made with respect to the Class X-B Certificates.  The Trust Fund, described more fully below, consists primarily of a pool of Mortgage Loans secured by first liens on commercial and multifamily properties and held in trust by the Trustee and serviced by the Master Servicer.  The Trust Fund was created, and the Mortgage Loans are to be serviced, pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement (as defined below).  The Holder of this Certificate, by virtue of the acceptance hereof, assents to the terms, provisions and conditions of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement and is bound thereby.

 Holders of Certificates issued under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement are collectively referred to herein as "Certificateholders").  This Certificate is issued pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.  To the extent not defined herein, capitalized terms used herein shall have the meanings assigned thereto in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.



 This Certificate represents a "regular interest" in a "real estate mortgage investment conduit", as those terms are defined, respectively, in Sections 860G(a)(1) and 860D of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.  Each Holder of this Certificate, by acceptance hereof, agrees to treat, and take no action inconsistent with the treatment of, this Certificate in accordance with the preceding sentence for purposes of federal income taxes, state and local income and franchise taxes and other taxes imposed on or measured by income.



 The Certificate Administrator makes no representation or warranty as to any of the statements contained herein or the validity or sufficiency of the Certificates or the Mortgage Loans and has executed this Certificate in its limited capacity as Certificate Administrator under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.



 Pursuant to the terms of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, the Certificate Administrator, or the Paying Agent on behalf of the Certificate Administrator, will distribute (other than the final distribution on any Certificate), on the fourth Business Day after each Determination Date (each such date, a "Distribution Date") an amount equal to such Person's pro rata share (based on the Percentage Interest represented by this Certificate) of that portion of the aggregate amount of interest then distributable, if any, allocable to the Class X-B Certificates for such Distribution Date, all as more fully described in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.  "Determination Date" is defined in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement as the sixth day of each month, or if such sixth day is not a Business Day, then the next Business Day, commencing in December 2013.  Holders of this Certificate may be entitled to Prepayment Premiums and Yield Maintenance Charges as provided in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.



 During each Interest Accrual Period (as defined below), interest on the Class X-B Certificates will be calculated based on a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months on the outstanding Notional Balance hereof.



 Interest accrued on this Certificate during an Interest Accrual Period, plus the aggregate unpaid Interest Shortfall with respect to this Certificate, if any, will be payable on the related Distribution Date to the extent provided in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.  The "Interest Accrual Period" means, with respect to any Distribution Date, the calendar month immediately preceding the month in which such Distribution Date occurs.  Each Interest Accrual Period is assumed to consist of 30 days.



 All distributions (other than the final distribution on any Certificate) will be made by the Paying Agent to the Persons in whose names the Certificates are registered at the close of business on each Record Date, which will be the close of business on the last Business Day of the calendar month preceding the month in which such Distribution Date occurs; provided that with respect to the Distribution Date occurring in December 2013, the Record Date will be the Closing Date.  Such distributions shall be made on each Distribution Date other than the







 Termination Date to each Certificateholder of record on the related Record Date, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account of such Holder at a bank or other entity located in the United States and having appropriate facilities therefor if such Holder shall have provided the Paying Agent with wire instructions in writing at least five Business Days prior to the related Record Date, or, otherwise, by check mailed by first-class mail to the address set forth therefor in the Certificate Register.  The final distribution on each Certificate shall be made in like manner, but only upon presentment and surrender of such Certificate at the office of the Certificate Administrator or its agent (which may be the Paying Agent or the Certificate Registrar acting as such agent) that is specified in the notice to Holders of such final distribution.



 Any funds not distributed on the Termination Date because of the failure of any Certificateholders to tender their Certificates shall, on such date, be set aside and held in trust for the benefit of the appropriate non-tendering Certificateholders.  If any Certificates as to which notice of the Termination Date has been given pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement shall not have been surrendered for cancellation within six months after the time specified in such notice, the Certificate Administrator shall mail a second notice to the remaining non-tendering Certificateholders, at their last addresses shown in the Certificate Register, to surrender their Certificates for cancellation in order to receive, from such funds held, the final distribution with respect thereto.  If within one year after the second notice not all of such Certificates shall have been surrendered for cancellation, the Certificate Administrator may, directly or through an agent, take appropriate steps to contact the remaining non-tendering Certificateholders concerning surrender of their Certificates.  The costs and expenses of holding such funds in trust and of contacting such Certificateholders shall be paid out of such funds.  If within two years after the second notice any such Certificates shall not have been surrendered for cancellation, the Paying Agent shall pay to the Certificate Administrator all amounts distributable to the Holders thereof, and the Certificate Administrator shall thereafter hold such amounts for the benefit of such Holders until the earlier of (i) its termination as Certificate Administrator under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement and the transfer of such amounts to a successor certificate administrator and (ii) the termination of the Trust Fund and distribution of such amounts to the Residual Certificateholders.  No interest shall accrue or be payable to any Certificateholder on any amount held as a result of such Certificateholder's failure to surrender its Certificate(s) for final payment thereof in accordance with the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.  Such funds held by the Certificate Administrator may be invested under certain circumstances, and all income and gain realized from investment of such funds shall accrue for its benefit.



 This Certificate is limited in right of payment to, among other things, certain collections and recoveries in respect of the Mortgage Loans, as more specifically set forth herein and in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.



 As provided in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, the Trust Fund includes (in each case and to the extent of the Trust Fund's interest therein and specifically excluding any interest of any Serviced Companion Loan Noteholder therein) (i) such Mortgage Loans as from time to time are subject to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, together with the Mortgage Files relating thereto; (ii) all scheduled or unscheduled payments on or collections in respect of the Mortgage Loans due after the Cut-off Date; (iii) the Trust Fund's interest in any REO Property; (iv) all revenues received in respect of any REO Property; (v) any Assignments of







 Leases, Rents and Profits and any security agreements related to the Mortgage Loans; (vi) any indemnities or guaranties given as additional security for any Mortgage Loans; (vii) a security interest in all assets deposited in the Lock-Box Accounts, Cash Collateral Accounts, Escrow Accounts and Reserve Accounts; (viii) the Loss of Value Reserve Fund; (ix) the Collection Account, the Serviced Loan Combination Collection Accounts, the Distribution Accounts, any Excess Liquidation Proceeds Account, the Interest Reserve Account and the Trust's interest in any REO Account, including any amounts on deposit therein, assets credited thereto and any reinvestment income, as applicable; (x) a security interest in any environmental indemnity agreements relating to the Mortgaged Properties; (xi) a security interest in all insurance policies with respect to the Mortgage Loans and the Mortgaged Properties; (xii) the rights and remedies under the Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreements relating to document delivery requirements with respect to the Mortgage Loans and the representations and warranties of the related Mortgage Loan Seller regarding its Mortgage Loans; (xiii) the Lower-Tier Regular Interests and the Class EC Regular Interests and (xiv) the proceeds of the foregoing (other than any interest earned on deposits in the Lock-Box Accounts, Cash Collateral Accounts, Escrow Accounts and any Reserve Accounts, to the extent such interest belongs to the related Borrower).  As provided in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, withdrawals may be made from certain of the above-accounts for purposes other than distributions to Certificateholders.

        (i)   reduce in any manner the amount of, or delay the timing of, payments received on the Mortgage Loans or Serviced Loan Combinations which are required to be distributed on any Certificate, without the consent of the Holders of Certificates representing all of the Percentage Interests of the Class or Classes affected thereby or which are required to be distributed to any Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders without the consent of such Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders;



        (ii)   change the percentages of Voting Rights or Percentage Interests of Holders of Certificates which are required to consent to any action or inaction under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement;

 taxes, at all times that any Certificates are outstanding; provided, that such action, as evidenced by an Opinion of Counsel (obtained at the expense of the Trust Fund), is necessary or helpful to maintain such qualification or to prevent the imposition of any such taxes, and would not adversely affect in any material respect the interest of any Certificateholder or, if applicable, any Serviced Companion Loan Noteholder or (ii) to the extent necessary to comply with the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, the Exchange Act, Regulation AB, and/or any related regulatory actions and/or interpretations.

        (A)   100% of the Stated Principal Balance of each Mortgage Loan included in the Trust Fund as of the last day of the month preceding such Anticipated Termination Date (less any P&I Advances previously made on account of principal);



        (B)   the fair market value of all other property included in the Trust Fund as of the last day of the month preceding such Anticipated Termination Date, as determined by an Independent appraiser acceptable to the Master Servicer as of a date not more than 30 days prior to the last day of the month preceding such Distribution Date;



        (C)   all unpaid interest accrued on the unpaid balance of each Mortgage Loan (including any Mortgage Loan as to which title to the related Mortgaged Property has been acquired) at the Mortgage Rate to the last day of the month preceding such Anticipated Termination Date (less any P&I Advances previously made on account of interest); and



        (D)   the aggregate amount of unreimbursed Advances, with interest thereon at the Advance Rate, and unpaid Servicing Compensation, Special Servicing Compensation, Operating Advisor Fees, Trustee/Certificate Administrator Fees, the CREFC® License Fees and Trust Fund expenses.

 This certifies that [              ] is the registered owner of a beneficial ownership interest in a Trust Fund, including the distributions to be made with respect to the Class X-C Certificates.  The Trust Fund, described more fully below, consists primarily of a pool of Mortgage Loans secured by first liens on commercial and multifamily properties and held in trust by the Trustee and serviced by the Master Servicer.  The Trust Fund was created, and the Mortgage Loans are to be serviced, pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement (as defined below).  The Holder of this Certificate, by virtue of the acceptance hereof, assents to the terms, provisions and conditions of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement and is bound thereby.

 Holders of Certificates issued under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement are collectively referred to herein as "Certificateholders").  This Certificate is issued pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.  To the extent not defined herein, capitalized terms used herein shall have the meanings assigned thereto in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.



 This Certificate represents a "regular interest" in a "real estate mortgage investment conduit", as those terms are defined, respectively, in Sections 860G(a)(1) and 860D of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.  Each Holder of this Certificate, by acceptance hereof, agrees to treat, and take no action inconsistent with the treatment of, this Certificate in accordance with the preceding sentence for purposes of federal income taxes, state and local income and franchise taxes and other taxes imposed on or measured by income.



 The Certificate Administrator makes no representation or warranty as to any of the statements contained herein or the validity or sufficiency of the Certificates or the Mortgage Loans and has executed this Certificate in its limited capacity as Certificate Administrator under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.



 Pursuant to the terms of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, the Certificate Administrator, or the Paying Agent on behalf of the Certificate Administrator, will distribute (other than the final distribution on any Certificate), on the fourth Business Day after each Determination Date (each such date, a "Distribution Date") an amount equal to such Person's pro rata share (based on the Percentage Interest represented by this Certificate) of that portion of the aggregate amount of interest then distributable, if any, allocable to the Class X-C Certificates for such Distribution Date, all as more fully described in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.  "Determination Date" is defined in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement as the sixth day of each month, or if such sixth day is not a Business Day, then the next Business Day, commencing in December 2013.  Holders of this Certificate may be entitled to Prepayment Premiums and Yield Maintenance Charges as provided in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.



 During each Interest Accrual Period (as defined below), interest on the Class X-C Certificates will be calculated based on a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months on the outstanding Notional Balance hereof.



 Interest accrued on this Certificate during an Interest Accrual Period, plus the aggregate unpaid Interest Shortfall with respect to this Certificate, if any, will be payable on the related Distribution Date to the extent provided in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.  The "Interest Accrual Period" means, with respect to any Distribution Date, the calendar month immediately preceding the month in which such Distribution Date occurs.  Each Interest Accrual Period is assumed to consist of 30 days.



 All distributions (other than the final distribution on any Certificate) will be made by the Paying Agent to the Persons in whose names the Certificates are registered at the close of business on each Record Date, which will be the close of business on the last Business Day of the calendar month preceding the month in which such Distribution Date occurs; provided that with respect to the Distribution Date occurring in December 2013, the Record Date will be the Closing Date.  Such distributions shall be made on each Distribution Date other than the







 Termination Date to each Certificateholder of record on the related Record Date, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account of such Holder at a bank or other entity located in the United States and having appropriate facilities therefor if such Holder shall have provided the Paying Agent with wire instructions in writing at least five Business Days prior to the related Record Date, or, otherwise, by check mailed by first-class mail to the address set forth therefor in the Certificate Register.  The final distribution on each Certificate shall be made in like manner, but only upon presentment and surrender of such Certificate at the office of the Certificate Administrator or its agent (which may be the Paying Agent or the Certificate Registrar acting as such agent) that is specified in the notice to Holders of such final distribution.



 Any funds not distributed on the Termination Date because of the failure of any Certificateholders to tender their Certificates shall, on such date, be set aside and held in trust for the benefit of the appropriate non-tendering Certificateholders.  If any Certificates as to which notice of the Termination Date has been given pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement shall not have been surrendered for cancellation within six months after the time specified in such notice, the Certificate Administrator shall mail a second notice to the remaining non-tendering Certificateholders, at their last addresses shown in the Certificate Register, to surrender their Certificates for cancellation in order to receive, from such funds held, the final distribution with respect thereto.  If within one year after the second notice not all of such Certificates shall have been surrendered for cancellation, the Certificate Administrator may, directly or through an agent, take appropriate steps to contact the remaining non-tendering Certificateholders concerning surrender of their Certificates.  The costs and expenses of holding such funds in trust and of contacting such Certificateholders shall be paid out of such funds.  If within two years after the second notice any such Certificates shall not have been surrendered for cancellation, the Paying Agent shall pay to the Certificate Administrator all amounts distributable to the Holders thereof, and the Certificate Administrator shall thereafter hold such amounts for the benefit of such Holders until the earlier of (i) its termination as Certificate Administrator under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement and the transfer of such amounts to a successor certificate administrator and (ii) the termination of the Trust Fund and distribution of such amounts to the Residual Certificateholders.  No interest shall accrue or be payable to any Certificateholder on any amount held as a result of such Certificateholder's failure to surrender its Certificate(s) for final payment thereof in accordance with the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.  Such funds held by the Certificate Administrator may be invested under certain circumstances, and all income and gain realized from investment of such funds shall accrue for its benefit.

 Confirmation from each applicable Rating Agency.  In no event shall any such amendment cause the Lower-Tier REMIC or the Upper-Tier REMIC to fail to qualify as a REMIC or the Grantor Trust to fail to qualify as a grantor trust or to significantly change the activities of the Trust.



 The Pooling and Servicing Agreement or any Custodial Agreement may also be amended from time to time by the Depositor, the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Certificate Administrator, the Operating Advisor and the Trustee with the prior written consent of the Holders of Certificates representing not less than 66-2/3% of the Percentage Interests of each Class of Certificates affected thereby (without regard to Certificates held by the Depositor, any of the Depositor's Affiliates and/or agents) and each Serviced Companion Loan Noteholder affected thereby for the purpose of adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement or modifying in any manner the rights of the Certificateholders or the Serviced Companion Noteholders; provided, that no such amendment may:



        (v)   reduce in any manner the amount of, or delay the timing of, payments received on the Mortgage Loans or Serviced Loan Combinations which are required to be distributed on any Certificate, without the consent of the Holders of Certificates representing all of the Percentage Interests of the Class or Classes affected thereby or which are required to be distributed to any Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders without the consent of such Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders;

 Further, the Depositor, the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Certificate Administrator, the Operating Advisor and the Trustee, at any time and from time to time, without the consent of the Certificateholders or, if applicable, the Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders, may amend the Pooling and Servicing Agreement to modify, eliminate or add to any of its provisions (i) to such extent as shall be necessary to maintain the qualification of the Lower-Tier REMIC or the Upper-Tier REMIC as a REMIC or the qualification of the Grantor Trust as a grantor trust, or to prevent the imposition of any additional material state or local







 taxes, at all times that any Certificates are outstanding; provided, that such action, as evidenced by an Opinion of Counsel (obtained at the expense of the Trust Fund), is necessary or helpful to maintain such qualification or to prevent the imposition of any such taxes, and would not adversely affect in any material respect the interest of any Certificateholder or, if applicable, any Serviced Companion Loan Noteholder or (ii) to the extent necessary to comply with the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, the Exchange Act, Regulation AB, and/or any related regulatory actions and/or interpretations.

        (D)   the aggregate amount of unreimbursed Advances, with interest thereon at the Advance Rate, and unpaid Servicing Compensation, Special Servicing Compensation, Operating Advisor Fees, Trustee/Certificate Administrator Fees, the CREFC® License Fees and Trust Fund expenses.

 This certifies that [              ] is the registered owner of the Percentage Interest evidenced by this Certificate in the Class R Certificates issued by the Trust Fund. The Class R Certificateholder is not entitled to interest or principal distributions.  The Class R Certificateholder will be entitled to receive the proceeds of the remaining assets of the Upper-Tier REMIC, if any, on the Final Scheduled Distribution Date for the Certificates, after distributions in respect of any accrued but unpaid interest on the Certificates and after distributions in reduction of principal balance have reduced the principal balances of the Certificates to zero.  It is not anticipated that there will be any assets remaining in the Upper-Tier REMIC or Trust Fund on the Final Scheduled Distribution Date following the distributions on the Regular Certificates.  The Trust Fund, described more fully below, consists primarily of a pool of Mortgage Loans secured by first liens on commercial and multifamily properties and held in trust by the Trustee and serviced by the Master Servicer.  The Trust Fund was created, and the Mortgage Loans are to be serviced, pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement (as defined below).  The Holder of this Certificate, by virtue of the acceptance hereof, assents to the terms, provisions and conditions of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement and is bound thereby.



 The Pooling and Servicing Agreement, dated as of November 1, 2013 (the "Pooling and Servicing Agreement"), among the Depositor, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as master servicer (the "Master Servicer"), LNR Partners, LLC, as special servicer (the "Special Servicer"), Park Bridge Lender Services LLC, as operating advisor (the "Operating Advisor"), UxxPDSxxPD Bank National Association, as trustee (the "Trustee"), and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as certificate administrator (the "Certificate Administrator"), paying agent and custodian, evidences the issuance of the Class A-1, Class A-2, Class A-3, Class A-4, Class A-SB, Class A-M, Class B, Class PEZ, Class C, Class X-A, Class X-B, Class X-C, Class D, Class E, Class F, Class G, Class V, Class R and Class LR Certificates (the "Certificates"; the Holders of Certificates issued under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement are collectively referred to herein as "Certificateholders").  This Certificate is issued pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.  To the extent not defined herein, capitalized terms used herein shall have the meanings assigned thereto in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.

    2 For Rule 144A Certificates







 This Class R Certificate represents the sole "residual interest" in a "real estate mortgage investment conduit", as those terms are defined, respectively, in Sections 860G(a)(2) and 860D of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.  Each Holder of this Certificate, by acceptance hereof, agrees to treat, and take no action inconsistent with the treatment of, this Certificate in accordance with the preceding sentence for purposes of federal income taxes, state and local income and franchise taxes and other taxes imposed on or measured by income.  The Holder of the largest Percentage Interest in the Class R Certificates shall be the "tax matters person" for the Upper-Tier REMIC pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section 1.860F-4(d), and the Certificate Administrator is hereby irrevocably designated and shall serve as attorney-in-fact and agent for any such Person that is the "tax matters person".



 The Certificate Administrator makes no representation or warranty as to any of the statements contained herein or the validity or sufficiency of the Certificates or the Mortgage Loans and has executed this Certificate in its limited capacity as Certificate Administrator under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.



 All distributions (other than the final distribution on any Certificate) will be made by the Paying Agent to the Persons in whose names the Certificates are registered at the close of business on each Record Date, which will be the close of business on the last Business Day of the calendar month preceding the month in which such Distribution Date occurs; provided that with respect to the Distribution Date occurring in December 2013, the Record Date will be the Closing Date.  Such distributions shall be made on each Distribution Date other than the Termination Date to each Certificateholder of record on the related Record Date, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account of such Holder at a bank or other entity located in the United States and having appropriate facilities therefor if such Holder shall have provided the Paying Agent with wire instructions in writing at least five Business Days prior to the related Record Date, or, otherwise, by check mailed by first-class mail to the address set forth therefor in the Certificate Register.  The final distribution on each Certificate shall be made in like manner, but only upon presentment and surrender of such Certificate at the office of the Certificate Administrator or its agent (which may be the Paying Agent or the Certificate Registrar acting as such agent) that is specified in the notice to Holders of such final distribution.



 Any funds not distributed on the Termination Date because of the failure of any Certificateholders to tender their Certificates shall, on such date, be set aside and held in trust for the benefit of the appropriate non-tendering Certificateholders.  If any Certificates as to which notice of the Termination Date has been given pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement shall not have been surrendered for cancellation within six months after the time specified in such notice, the Certificate Administrator shall mail a second notice to the remaining non-tendering Certificateholders, at their last addresses shown in the Certificate Register, to surrender their Certificates for cancellation in order to receive, from such funds held, the final distribution with respect thereto.  If within one year after the second notice not all of such Certificates shall have been surrendered for cancellation, the Certificate Administrator may, directly or through an agent, take appropriate steps to contact the remaining non-tendering Certificateholders concerning surrender of their Certificates.  The costs and expenses of holding such funds in trust and of contacting such Certificateholders shall be paid out of such funds.  If within two years after the second notice any such Certificates shall not have been surrendered for cancellation, the Paying Agent shall pay to the Certificate Administrator all amounts







 distributable to the Holders thereof, and the Certificate Administrator shall thereafter hold such amounts for the benefit of such Holders until the earlier of (i) its termination as Certificate Administrator under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement and the transfer of such amounts to a successor certificate administrator and (ii) the termination of the Trust Fund and distribution of such amounts to the Residual Certificateholders.  No interest shall accrue or be payable to any Certificateholder on any amount held as a result of such Certificateholder's failure to surrender its Certificate(s) for final payment thereof in accordance with the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.  Such funds held by the Certificate Administrator may be invested under certain circumstances, and all income and gain realized from investment of such funds shall accrue for its benefit.

 or supplement a provision, or to supplement any other provisions to the extent not inconsistent with the provisions of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, or to effect any other change, in each case which will not adversely affect in any material respect the interests of any Certificateholder or Serviced Companion Loan Noteholder not consenting thereto, as evidenced in writing by an Opinion of Counsel or, if solely affecting any Certificateholder of a rated Class or Serviced Companion Loan Noteholder, in respect of which a No Downgrade Confirmation has been obtained relating to the Certificates of a rated Class and Serviced Companion Loan Securities, if any; (v) to modify the procedures in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement relating to compliance with Rule 17g-5 of the Exchange Act; and (vi) in the event of a TIA Applicability Determination, to modify, eliminate or add to the provisions of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement (A) to the extent necessary to effect the qualification of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement under the TIA or under any similar federal statute hereafter enacted and to add to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement such other provisions as may be expressly required by the TIA, and (B) to modify such other provisions of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement to the extent necessary to make those provisions consistent with, and conform to, the modifications made pursuant to clause (A); provided that any amendment pursuant to this clause (vi) shall be at the sole cost and expense of the Depositor.

 The Pooling and Servicing Agreement or any Custodial Agreement may also be amended from time to time by the Depositor, the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Certificate Administrator, the Operating Advisor and the Trustee with the prior written consent of the Holders of Certificates representing not less than 66-2/3% of the Percentage Interests of each Class of Certificates affected thereby (without regard to Certificates held by the Depositor, any of the Depositor's Affiliates and/or agents) and each Serviced Companion Loan Noteholder affected thereby for the purpose of adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement or modifying in any manner the rights of the Certificateholders or the Serviced Companion Noteholders; provided, that no such amendment may:



        (i)   reduce in any manner the amount of, or delay the timing of, payments received on the Mortgage Loans or Serviced Loan Combinations which are required to be distributed on any Certificate, without the consent of the Holders of Certificates representing all of the Percentage Interests of the Class or Classes affected thereby or which are required to be distributed to any Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders without the consent of such Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders;







        (ii)   change the percentages of Voting Rights or Percentage Interests of Holders of Certificates which are required to consent to any action or inaction under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement;

        (iv)   amend any section hereof which relates to the amendment of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement without the consent of the Holders of all Certificates representing all of the Percentage Interests of the Class or Classes affected thereby and the consent of any affected Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders.



 Further, the Depositor, the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Certificate Administrator, the Operating Advisor and the Trustee, at any time and from time to time, without the consent of the Certificateholders or, if applicable, the Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders, may amend the Pooling and Servicing Agreement to modify, eliminate or add to any of its provisions (i) to such extent as shall be necessary to maintain the qualification of the Lower-Tier REMIC or the Upper-Tier REMIC as a REMIC or the qualification of the Grantor Trust as a grantor trust, or to prevent the imposition of any additional material state or local taxes, at all times that any Certificates are outstanding; provided, that such action, as evidenced by an Opinion of Counsel (obtained at the expense of the Trust Fund), is necessary or helpful to maintain such qualification or to prevent the imposition of any such taxes, and would not adversely affect in any material respect the interest of any Certificateholder or, if applicable, any Serviced Companion Loan Noteholder or (ii) to the extent necessary to comply with the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, the Exchange Act, Regulation AB, and/or any related regulatory actions and/or interpretations.

        (D)   the aggregate amount of unreimbursed Advances, with interest thereon at the Advance Rate, and unpaid Servicing Compensation, Special Servicing Compensation, Operating Advisor Fees, Trustee/Certificate Administrator Fees, the CREFC® License Fees and Trust Fund expenses.

 This certifies that [              ] is the registered owner of the Percentage Interest evidenced by this Certificate in the Class LR Certificates issued by the Trust Fund. The Class LR Certificateholder is not entitled to interest or principal distributions.  The Class LR Certificateholder will be entitled to receive the proceeds of the remaining assets of the Lower-Tier REMIC, if any, on the Final Scheduled Distribution Date for the Certificates, after distributions in respect of any accrued but unpaid interest on the Certificates and after distributions in reduction of principal balance have reduced the principal balances of the Certificates to zero.  It is not anticipated that there will be any assets remaining in the Lower-Tier REMIC or Trust Fund on the Final Scheduled Distribution Date following the distributions on the Regular Certificates.  The Trust Fund, described more fully below, consists primarily of a pool of Mortgage Loans secured by first liens on commercial and multifamily properties and held in trust by the Trustee and serviced by the Master Servicer.  The Trust Fund was created, and the Mortgage Loans are to be serviced, pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement (as defined below).  The Holder of this Certificate, by virtue of the acceptance hereof, assents to the terms, provisions and conditions of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement and is bound thereby.



 The Pooling and Servicing Agreement, dated as of November 1, 2013 (the "Pooling and Servicing Agreement"), among the Depositor, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as master servicer (the "Master Servicer"), LNR Partners, LLC, as special servicer (the "Special Servicer"), Park Bridge Lender Services LLC, as operating advisor (the "Operating Advisor"), UxxPDSxxPD Bank National Association, as trustee (the "Trustee"), and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as certificate administrator (the "Certificate Administrator"), paying agent and custodian, evidences the issuance of the Class A-1, Class A-2, Class A-3, Class A-4, Class A-SB, Class A-M, Class B, Class PEZ, Class C, Class X-A, Class X-B, Class X-C, Class D, Class E, Class F, Class G, Class V, Class R and Class LR Certificates (the "Certificates"; the Holders of Certificates issued under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement are collectively referred to herein as "Certificateholders").  This Certificate is issued pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.  To the extent not defined herein, capitalized terms used herein shall have the meanings assigned thereto in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.



 This Class LR Certificate represents the sole "residual interest" in a "real estate mortgage investment conduit", as those terms are defined, respectively, in Sections 860G(a)(2)



 1 For Rule 144A Certificates

    2 For Rule 144A Certificates







 and 860D of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.  Each Holder of this Certificate, by acceptance hereof, agrees to treat, and take no action inconsistent with the treatment of, this Certificate in accordance with the preceding sentence for purposes of federal income taxes, state and local income and franchise taxes and other taxes imposed on or measured by income.  The Holder of the largest Percentage Interest in the Class LR Certificates shall be the "tax matters person" for the Lower-Tier REMIC pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section 1.860F-4(d), and the Certificate Administrator is hereby irrevocably designated and shall serve as attorney-in-fact and agent for any such Person that is the "tax matters person".



 The Certificate Administrator makes no representation or warranty as to any of the statements contained herein or the validity or sufficiency of the Certificates or the Mortgage Loans and has executed this Certificate in its limited capacity as Certificate Administrator under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.



 All distributions (other than the final distribution on any Certificate) will be made by the Paying Agent to the Persons in whose names the Certificates are registered at the close of business on each Record Date, which will be the close of business on the last Business Day of the calendar month preceding the month in which such Distribution Date occurs; provided that with respect to the Distribution Date occurring in December 2013, the Record Date will be the Closing Date.  Such distributions shall be made on each Distribution Date other than the Termination Date to each Certificateholder of record on the related Record Date, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account of such Holder at a bank or other entity located in the United States and having appropriate facilities therefor if such Holder shall have provided the Paying Agent with wire instructions in writing at least five Business Days prior to the related Record Date, or, otherwise, by check mailed by first-class mail to the address set forth therefor in the Certificate Register.  The final distribution on each Certificate shall be made in like manner, but only upon presentment and surrender of such Certificate at the office of the Certificate Administrator or its agent (which may be the Paying Agent or the Certificate Registrar acting as such agent) that is specified in the notice to Holders of such final distribution.



 Any funds not distributed on the Termination Date because of the failure of any Certificateholders to tender their Certificates shall, on such date, be set aside and held in trust for the benefit of the appropriate non-tendering Certificateholders.  If any Certificates as to which notice of the Termination Date has been given pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement shall not have been surrendered for cancellation within six months after the time specified in such notice, the Certificate Administrator shall mail a second notice to the remaining non-tendering Certificateholders, at their last addresses shown in the Certificate Register, to surrender their Certificates for cancellation in order to receive, from such funds held, the final distribution with respect thereto.  If within one year after the second notice not all of such Certificates shall have been surrendered for cancellation, the Certificate Administrator may, directly or through an agent, take appropriate steps to contact the remaining non-tendering Certificateholders concerning surrender of their Certificates.  The costs and expenses of holding such funds in trust and of contacting such Certificateholders shall be paid out of such funds.  If within two years after the second notice any such Certificates shall not have been surrendered for cancellation, the Paying Agent shall pay to the Certificate Administrator all amounts distributable to the Holders thereof, and the Certificate Administrator shall thereafter hold such amounts for the benefit of such Holders until the earlier of (i) its termination as Certificate







 Administrator under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement and the transfer of such amounts to a successor certificate administrator and (ii) the termination of the Trust Fund and distribution of such amounts to the Residual Certificateholders.  No interest shall accrue or be payable to any Certificateholder on any amount held as a result of such Certificateholder's failure to surrender its Certificate(s) for final payment thereof in accordance with the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.  Such funds held by the Certificate Administrator may be invested under certain circumstances, and all income and gain realized from investment of such funds shall accrue for its benefit.

 Certificateholder or Serviced Companion Loan Noteholder not consenting thereto, as evidenced in writing by an Opinion of Counsel or, if solely affecting any Certificateholder of a rated Class or Serviced Companion Loan Noteholder, in respect of which a No Downgrade Confirmation has been obtained relating to the Certificates of a rated Class and Serviced Companion Loan Securities, if any; (v) to modify the procedures in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement relating to compliance with Rule 17g-5 of the Exchange Act; and (vi) in the event of a TIA Applicability Determination, to modify, eliminate or add to the provisions of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement (A) to the extent necessary to effect the qualification of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement under the TIA or under any similar federal statute hereafter enacted and to add to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement such other provisions as may be expressly required by the TIA, and (B) to modify such other provisions of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement to the extent necessary to make those provisions consistent with, and conform to, the modifications made pursuant to clause (A); provided that any amendment pursuant to this clause (vi) shall be at the sole cost and expense of the Depositor.

        (i)   reduce in any manner the amount of, or delay the timing of, payments received on the Mortgage Loans or Serviced Loan Combinations which are required to be distributed on any Certificate, without the consent of the Holders of Certificates representing all of the Percentage Interests of the Class or Classes affected thereby or which are required to be distributed to any Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders without the consent of such Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders;



        (ii)   change the percentages of Voting Rights or Percentage Interests of Holders of Certificates which are required to consent to any action or inaction under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement;

The Trust Fund was created, and the Mortgage Loans are to be serviced, pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement (as defined below).  The Holder of this Certificate, by virtue of the acceptance hereof, assents to the terms, provisions and conditions of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement and is bound thereby.

 The Certificate Administrator makes no representation or warranty as to any of the statements contained herein or the validity or sufficiency of the Certificates or the Mortgage Loans and has executed this Certificate in its limited capacity as Certificate Administrator under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.



 Pursuant to the terms of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, the Certificate Administrator, or the Paying Agent on behalf of the Certificate Administrator, will distribute (other than the final distribution on any Certificate), on the fourth Business Day after each Determination Date (each such date, a "Distribution Date") an amount equal to such Person's pro rata share (based on the Percentage Interest represented by this Certificate) of that portion of the aggregate amount of interest then distributable, if any, allocable to the Class V Certificates for such Distribution Date, all as more fully described in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.  "Determination Date" is defined in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement as the sixth day of each month, or if such sixth day is not a Business Day, then the next Business Day, commencing in December 2013.  Holders of this Certificate may be entitled to Prepayment Premiums and Yield Maintenance Charges as provided in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.



 All distributions (other than the final distribution on any Certificate) will be made by the Paying Agent to the Persons in whose names the Certificates are registered at the close of business on each Record Date, which will be the close of business on the last Business Day of the calendar month preceding the month in which such Distribution Date occurs; provided that with respect to the Distribution Date occurring in December 2013, the Record Date will be the Closing Date.  Such distributions shall be made on each Distribution Date other than the Termination Date to each Certificateholder of record on the related Record Date, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account of such Holder at a bank or other entity located in the United States and having appropriate facilities therefor if such Holder shall have provided the Paying Agent with wire instructions in writing at least five Business Days prior to the related Record Date, or, otherwise, by check mailed by first-class mail to the address set forth therefor in the Certificate Register.  The final distribution on each Certificate shall be made in like manner, but only upon presentment and surrender of such Certificate at the office of the Certificate Administrator or its agent (which may be the Paying Agent or the Certificate Registrar acting as such agent) that is specified in the notice to Holders of such final distribution.



 Any funds not distributed on the Termination Date because of the failure of any Certificateholders to tender their Certificates shall, on such date, be set aside and held in trust for the benefit of the appropriate non-tendering Certificateholders.  If any Certificates as to which notice of the Termination Date has been given pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement shall not have been surrendered for cancellation within six months after the time specified in such notice, the Certificate Administrator shall mail a second notice to the remaining non-tendering Certificateholders, at their last addresses shown in the Certificate Register, to surrender their Certificates for cancellation in order to receive, from such funds held, the final distribution with respect thereto.  If within one year after the second notice not all of such Certificates shall have been surrendered for cancellation, the Certificate Administrator may, directly or through an agent, take appropriate steps to contact the remaining non-tendering Certificateholders concerning surrender of their Certificates.  The costs and expenses of holding such funds in trust and of contacting such Certificateholders shall be paid out of such funds.  If within two years after the second notice any such Certificates shall not have been surrendered for







 cancellation, the Paying Agent shall pay to the Certificate Administrator all amounts distributable to the Holders thereof, and the Certificate Administrator shall thereafter hold such amounts for the benefit of such Holders until the earlier of (i) its termination as Certificate Administrator under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement and the transfer of such amounts to a successor certificate administrator and (ii) the termination of the Trust Fund and distribution of such amounts to the Residual Certificateholders.  No interest shall accrue or be payable to any Certificateholder on any amount held as a result of such Certificateholder's failure to surrender its Certificate(s) for final payment thereof in accordance with the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.  Such funds held by the Certificate Administrator may be invested under certain circumstances, and all income and gain realized from investment of such funds shall accrue for its benefit.

 The Pooling and Servicing Agreement or any Custodial Agreement may be amended at any time by the Depositor, the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Certificate Administrator, the Operating Advisor and the Trustee without the consent of any of the Certificateholders or Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders, (i) to cure any ambiguity or to correct any error; (ii) to cause the provisions of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement or any Custodial Agreement to conform or be consistent with or in furtherance of the statements made in the Prospectus or Private Placement Memorandum with respect to the Certificates, the Trust or the Pooling and Servicing Agreement or to correct or supplement any provisions herein or therein which may be defective or inconsistent with any other provisions herein or therein; (iii) to amend any provision of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement or any Custodial Agreement to the extent necessary or desirable to maintain the rating or ratings assigned to each of the Classes of Certificates or any Class of Serviced Companion Loan Securities by each Rating Agency; provided, that such amendment does not reduce the consent or consultation rights of the Controlling Class Representative or the right of the Controlling Class Representative to receive information under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement; (iv) to amend







 or supplement a provision, or to supplement any other provisions to the extent not inconsistent with the provisions of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, or to effect any other change, in each case which will not adversely affect in any material respect the interests of any Certificateholder or Serviced Companion Loan Noteholder not consenting thereto, as evidenced in writing by an Opinion of Counsel or, if solely affecting any Certificateholder of a rated Class or Serviced Companion Loan Noteholder, in respect of which a No Downgrade Confirmation has been obtained relating to the Certificates of a rated Class and Serviced Companion Loan Securities, if any; (v) to modify the procedures in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement relating to compliance with Rule 17g-5 of the Exchange Act; and (vi) in the event of a TIA Applicability Determination, to modify, eliminate or add to the provisions of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement (A) to the extent necessary to effect the qualification of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement under the TIA or under any similar federal statute hereafter enacted and to add to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement such other provisions as may be expressly required by the TIA, and (B) to modify such other provisions of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement to the extent necessary to make those provisions consistent with, and conform to, the modifications made pursuant to clause (A); provided that any amendment pursuant to this clause (vi) shall be at the sole cost and expense of the Depositor.  Such amendment (a) shall not materially increase the obligations of the Depositor, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Certificate Administrator, the Operating Advisor, the 17g-5 Information Provider, the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer without such party's consent; and (b) shall not adversely affect in any material respect the interests of any Certificateholder or Serviced Companion Loan Noteholder not consenting thereto, as evidenced in the case of clauses (iii) through (v) above by (x) an Opinion of Counsel or (y) solely in the case of a Certificateholder of a rated Class, receipt of a No Downgrade Confirmation from each applicable Rating Agency.  In no event shall any such amendment cause the Lower-Tier REMIC or the Upper-Tier REMIC to fail to qualify as a REMIC or the Grantor Trust to fail to qualify as a grantor trust or to significantly change the activities of the Trust.



 The Pooling and Servicing Agreement or any Custodial Agreement may also be amended from time to time by the Depositor, the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Certificate Administrator, the Operating Advisor and the Trustee with the prior written consent of the Holders of Certificates representing not less than 66-2/3% of the Percentage Interests of each Class of Certificates affected thereby (without regard to Certificates held by the Depositor, any of the Depositor's Affiliates and/or agents) and each Serviced Companion Loan Noteholder affected thereby for the purpose of adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement or modifying in any manner the rights of the Certificateholders or the Serviced Companion Noteholders; provided, that no such amendment may:



        (i)   reduce in any manner the amount of, or delay the timing of, payments received on the Mortgage Loans or Serviced Loan Combinations which are required to be distributed on any Certificate, without the consent of the Holders of Certificates representing all of the Percentage Interests of the Class or Classes affected thereby or which are required to be distributed to any Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders without the consent of such Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders;







        (ii)   change the percentages of Voting Rights or Percentage Interests of Holders of Certificates which are required to consent to any action or inaction under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement;



        (iii)   alter the Servicing Standard, the Operating Advisor Standard or obligations of the Master Servicer or the Trustee to make a P&I Advance or a Property Advance, without the consent of the Holders of Certificates representing all of the Percentage Interests of the Class or Classes affected thereby and the consent of any affected Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders; or



        (iv)   amend any section hereof which relates to the amendment of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement without the consent of the Holders of all Certificates representing all of the Percentage Interests of the Class or Classes affected thereby and the consent of any affected Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders.



 Further, the Depositor, the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Certificate Administrator, the Operating Advisor and the Trustee, at any time and from time to time, without the consent of the Certificateholders or, if applicable, the Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders, may amend the Pooling and Servicing Agreement to modify, eliminate or add to any of its provisions (i) to such extent as shall be necessary to maintain the qualification of the Lower-Tier REMIC or the Upper-Tier REMIC as a REMIC or the qualification of the Grantor Trust as a grantor trust, or to prevent the imposition of any additional material state or local taxes, at all times that any Certificates are outstanding; provided, that such action, as evidenced by an Opinion of Counsel (obtained at the expense of the Trust Fund), is necessary or helpful to maintain such qualification or to prevent the imposition of any such taxes, and would not adversely affect in any material respect the interest of any Certificateholder or, if applicable, any Serviced Companion Loan Noteholder or (ii) to the extent necessary to comply with the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, the Exchange Act, Regulation AB, and/or any related regulatory actions and/or interpretations.



 The Certificateholder owning a majority of the Percentage Interests in the Controlling Class and, if no such Certificateholder exercises such option, the Special Servicer, and if the Special Servicer does not exercise such option, the Master Servicer, may effect an early termination of the Trust Fund, upon not less than 30 days' prior Notice of Termination given to the Trustee, the Special Servicer and the Master Servicer any time on or after the Early Termination Notice Date (defined as any date as of which the aggregate Stated Principal Balance of the Mortgage Loans is less than 1.0% of the aggregate Stated Principal Balance of the Mortgage Loans as of the Cut-off Date) specifying the Anticipated Termination Date, by purchasing on such date all, but not less than all, of the Mortgage Loans then included in the Trust Fund, and the Trust's interest in all property acquired in respect of any Mortgage Loan, at a purchase price, payable in cash, equal to the sum of, without duplication:



        (A)   100% of the Stated Principal Balance of each Mortgage Loan included in the Trust Fund as of the last day of the month







           preceding such Anticipated Termination Date (less any P&I Advances previously made on account of principal);



        (B)   the fair market value of all other property included in the Trust Fund as of the last day of the month preceding such Anticipated Termination Date, as determined by an Independent appraiser acceptable to the Master Servicer as of a date not more than 30 days prior to the last day of the month preceding such Distribution Date;



        (C)   all unpaid interest accrued on the unpaid balance of each Mortgage Loan (including any Mortgage Loan as to which title to the related Mortgaged Property has been acquired) at the Mortgage Rate to the last day of the month preceding such Anticipated Termination Date (less any P&I Advances previously made on account of interest); and



        (D)   the aggregate amount of unreimbursed Advances, with interest thereon at the Advance Rate, and unpaid Servicing Compensation, Special Servicing Compensation, Operating Advisor Fees, Trustee/Certificate Administrator Fees, the CREFC® License Fees and Trust Fund expenses.



 In addition, the Pooling and Servicing Agreement provides that following the date on which the Class X-A Notional Amount and the aggregate Certificate Balance of the Class A-1, Class A-2, Class A-3, Class A-4, Class A-SB, Class A-M, Class B, Class PEZ, Class C and Class D Certificates is reduced to zero, the Sole Certificateholder shall have the right to exchange all of the then-outstanding Certificates (other than (i) the Class X-C Certificates if the Sole Certificateholder has only taken an assignment of the Voting Rights of the Class X-C Certificates pursuant to the definition of "Sole Certificateholder" and (ii) the Class V, Class R and Class LR Certificates) for all of the Mortgage Loans and each REO Property remaining in the Trust Fund as contemplated by clause (ii) of Section 9.01(a) of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement by giving written notice to all the parties to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement no later than 60 days prior to the anticipated date of exchange.



 All costs and expenses incurred by any and all parties to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement or by the Trust Fund in connection with the purchase of the Mortgage Loans and the other assets of the Trust Fund pursuant to Section 9.01(c) of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement shall be borne by the party exercising its purchase rights thereunder.  The Trustee and the Certificate Administrator shall be entitled to rely conclusively on any determination made by an Independent appraiser pursuant to Section 9.01(c) of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.



 The respective obligations and responsibilities of the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Depositor, the Certificate Administrator, the Operating Advisor and the Trustee created by the Pooling and Servicing Agreement with respect to the Certificates (other than the obligations of the Certificate Administrator to make certain payments and to send certain notices







 to Certificateholders as set forth in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement) shall terminate upon payment (or provision for payment) to the Certificateholders and the Serviced Companion Loan Noteholder of all amounts held by or on behalf of the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator and the Master Servicer, as the case may be, required under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement to be so paid on the Distribution Date following the earlier to occur of (i) the purchase of the Mortgage Loans and all other property held by the Trust Fund in accordance with Section 9.01(c) of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement; (ii) the exchange by the Sole Certificateholder of its Certificates for the Mortgage Loans in accordance with Section 9.01(g) of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement; and (iii) the later of (a) the receipt or collection of the last payment due on any Mortgage Loan included in the Trust Fund, or (b) the liquidation and disposition pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement of the last asset held by the Trust Fund; provided that in no event shall the trust created by the Pooling and Servicing Agreement continue beyond the expiration of 21 years from the death of the last survivor of the descendants of Joseph P. Kennedy, the late Ambassador of the United States to the United Kingdom, living on the date hereof.

 4.           That the Purchaser historically has paid its debts as they have come due and intends to pay its debts as they come due in the future and the Purchaser intends to pay taxes associated with holding the Class [R] [LR] Certificate as they become due.



 5.           That the Purchaser understands that it may incur tax liabilities with respect to the Class [R] [LR] Certificate in excess of any cash flow generated by the Class [R] [LR] Certificate.



 6.           That the Purchaser will not transfer the Class [R] [LR] Certificate to any person or entity from which the Purchaser has not received an affidavit substantially in the form of this affidavit or as to which the Purchaser has actual knowledge that the requirements set forth in paragraph 3, paragraph 4 or paragraph 7 hereof are not satisfied or that the Purchaser has reason to know does not satisfy the requirements set forth in paragraph 4 hereof.

 8.           That the Purchaser agrees to such amendments of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement as may be required to further effectuate the restrictions on transfer of the Class [R] [LR] Certificate to a "disqualified organization," an agent thereof, or a person that does not satisfy the requirements of paragraph 4, paragraph 7 and paragraph 11 hereof.



 9.           That, if a "tax matters person" is required to be designated with respect to the [Upper-Tier REMIC] [Lower-Tier REMIC], the Purchaser agrees to act as "tax matters person" and to perform the functions of "tax matters partner" of the [Upper-Tier REMIC] [Lower-Tier REMIC] pursuant to Section 4.04 of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, and agrees to the irrevocable designation of the Certificate Administrator as the Purchaser's agent in performing the function of "tax matters person" and "tax matters partner."

 11.           The Purchaser will not cause income from the Class [R] [LR] Certificate to be attributable to a foreign permanent establishment or fixed base, within the meaning of an applicable income tax treaty, of the Purchaser or any other UxxPDSxxPD Tax Person.



 12.           Check the applicable paragraph:



                 o            The present value of the anticipated tax liabilities associated with holding the Class [R] [LR] Certificate, as applicable, does not exceed the sum of:



 (i)           the present value of any consideration given to the Purchaser to acquire such Class [R] [LR] Certificate;



 (ii)           the present value of the expected future distributions on such Certificate; and



 (iii)           the present value of the anticipated tax savings associated with holding such Class [R] [LR] Certificate as the related REMIC generates losses.



 For purposes of this calculation, (i) the Purchaser is assumed to pay tax at the highest rate currently specified in Code Section 11(b) (but the tax rate in Code Section 55(b)(1)(B) may be used in lieu of the highest rate specified in Code Section 11(b) if the Purchaser has been subject to the alternative minimum tax under Code Section 55 in the preceding two years and will compute its taxable income in the current taxable year using the alternative minimum tax rate) and (ii) present values are computed using a discount rate equal to the short term Federal rate prescribed by Code Section 1274(d) for the month of the transfer and the compounding period used by the Purchaser.

 (i)           the Purchaser is an "eligible corporation," as defined in UxxPDSxxPD Treasury Regulations Section 1.860E-1(c)(6)(i), as to which income from the Class [R] [LR] Certificate will only be taxed in the United States;



 (ii)           at the time of the transfer, and at the close of the Purchaser's two fiscal years preceding the year of the transfer, the Purchaser had gross assets for financial reporting purposes (excluding any obligation of a person related to the Purchaser within the meaning of UxxPDSxxPD Treasury Regulations Section 1.860E-1(c)(6)(ii)) in excess of $100 million and net assets in excess of $10 million;



 (iii)           the Purchaser will transfer the Class [R] [LR] Certificate only to another "eligible corporation," as defined in UxxPDSxxPD Treasury Regulations Section 1.860E-1(c)(6)(i), in a transaction that satisfies the requirements of Section 1.860E-1(c)(4)(i), (ii) and (iii) and Section 1.860E 1(c)(5) of the UxxPDSxxPD Treasury Regulations; and



 (iv)           the Purchaser determined the consideration paid to it to acquire the Class [R] [LR] Certificate based on reasonable market assumptions (including, but not limited to, borrowing and investment rates, prepayment and loss assumptions, expense and reinvestment assumptions, tax rates and other factors specific to the Purchaser) that it has determined in good faith.

 Ladies and Gentlemen:



 This letter is delivered pursuant to Section 5.02 of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement dated as of November 1, 2013 (the "Pooling and Servicing Agreement"), entered into among Deutsche Mortgage & Asset Receiving Corporation, as depositor, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as master servicer, LNR Partners, LLC, as special servicer, UxxPDSxxPD Bank National Association, as trustee, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as certificate administrator, paying agent and custodian, and Park Bridge Lender Services LLC, as operating advisor, on behalf of the holders of COMM 2013-CCRE12 Mortgage Trust Commercial Mortgage Pass Through Certificates (the "Certificates") in connection with the transfer by [_____] (the "Seller") to the undersigned (the "Purchaser") of [$_____ aggregate Certificate Balance][_____% Percentage Interest] of Class [   ] Certificates, in certificated fully registered form (such registered interest, the "Certificate").  Terms used but not defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed thereto in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.



 In connection with such transfer, the undersigned hereby represents and warrants to you as follows:



 [For Institutional Accredited Investors only]  1. The Purchaser is an institutional "accredited investor" (an "Institutional Accredited Investor") within the meaning of Rule 501 (a)(1), (2), (3) or (7) of Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act")) and has such knowledge and experience in financial and business matters as to be capable of evaluating the merits and risks of the investment in the Certificate, and the Purchaser and any accounts for which the Purchaser is acting are each able to bear the economic risk of the investment. The Purchaser is acquiring the Certificate for its own account or for one or more accounts (each of which is an Institutional Accredited Investor) as to each of which the



 D-1-1



 Purchaser exercises sole investment discretion.  The Purchaser hereby undertakes to reimburse the Trust for any costs incurred by it in connection with this transfer.



 [For Qualified Institutional Buyers only]  1. The Purchaser is a "qualified institutional buyer" within the meaning of Rule 144A ("Rule 144A") promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act").  The Purchaser is aware that the transfer is being made in reliance on Rule 144A, and the Purchaser has had the opportunity to obtain the information required to be provided pursuant to paragraph (d)(4)(i) of Rule 144A.



 2.           The Purchaser's intention is to acquire the Certificate (a) for investment for the Purchaser's own account or (b) for reoffer, resale, pledge or other transfer to (i) "qualified institutional buyers" within the meaning of, and in transactions complying with, Rule 144A promulgated under the Securities Act, (ii) entities qualifying as "accredited investors" within the meaning of Rule 501(a)(1), (2), (3) or (7) of Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act, or (iii) pursuant to any other exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act, subject in the case of this clause (iii) to (a) the receipt by the Certificate Registrar of a letter substantially in the form hereof, (b) the receipt by the Certificate Registrar of an opinion of counsel acceptable to the Certificate Registrar that such reoffer, resale, pledge or transfer is in compliance with the Securities Act, (c) the receipt by the Certificate Registrar of such other evidence acceptable to the Certificate Registrar that such reoffer, resale, pledge or transfer is in compliance with the Securities Act and other applicable laws (including applicable state and foreign securities laws), and (d) a written undertaking to reimburse the Trust for any costs incurred by it in connection with the proposed transfer. It understands that the Certificate (and any subsequent Individual Certificate) has not been registered under the Securities Act, by reason of a specified exemption from the registration provisions of the Securities Act which depends upon, among other things, the bona fide nature of the Purchaser's investment intent (or intent to resell to only certain investors in certain exempted transactions) as expressed herein.



 3.           The Purchaser acknowledges that the Certificate (and any Certificate issued on transfer or exchange thereof) has not been registered or qualified under the Securities Act or the securities laws of any State or any other jurisdiction, and that the Certificate cannot be reoffered, resold, pledged or otherwise transferred unless it is registered or qualified thereunder or unless an exemption from such registration or qualification is available.



 4.           The Purchaser has reviewed the applicable Private Placement Memorandum dated October 28, 2013, relating to the Certificates (the "Private Placement Memorandum") and the agreements and other materials referred to therein and has had the opportunity to ask questions and receive answers concerning the terms and conditions of the transactions contemplated by the Private Placement Memorandum.



 5.           The Purchaser hereby undertakes to be bound by the terms and conditions of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement in its capacity as an owner of an Individual Certificate or Certificates, as the case may be (each, a "Certificateholder"), in all respects as if it were a signatory thereto.  This undertaking is made for the benefit of the Trust, the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator, the Certificate Registrar and all Certificateholders present and future.



 D-1-2



 6.           The Purchaser will not sell or otherwise transfer any portion of the Certificate, except in compliance with Section 5.02 of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.



 7.           Check one of the following:



 o           The Purchaser is a "UxxPDSxxPD Tax Person" (as defined below) and it has attached hereto an Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") Form W-9 (or successor form).
