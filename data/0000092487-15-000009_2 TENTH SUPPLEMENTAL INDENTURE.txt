Definitions. The use of the terms and expressions herein is in accordance with the definitions, uses and constructions contained in the Original Indenture and the form of the Series J Note attached hereto as Exhibit A. ARTICLE TWO Terms and Issuance of the Series J Notes SECTION 201.    Issue of Series J Notes. A series of Senior Notes which shall be designated the "3.90% Senior Notes, Series J, due 2045" shall be executed, authenticated and delivered from time to time in accordance with the provisions of, and shall in all respects be subject to, the terms, conditions and covenants of, the Original Indenture and this Tenth Supplemental Indenture (including the form of Series J Note set forth in Exhibit A hereto). The aggregate principal amount of the Series J Notes which may be authenticated and delivered under this Tenth Supplemental Indenture shall initially be $400,000,000, and such principal amount of the Series J Notes may be increased from time to time. All Series J Notes need not be issued at the same time and such series may be reopened at any time, without the consent of any Holder, for the issuance of additional Series J Notes. Any such additional Series J Notes will have the same interest rate, maturity and other terms as those initially issued (other than the date of issuance, the issue price and, in some circumstances, the initial interest accrual date and initial interest payment date). SECTION 202.    Form of Series J Notes; Incorporation of Terms. The Series J Notes shall be issued initially in the form of one Global Security. The form of the Series J Notes shall be substantially in the form of the Global Security attached hereto as Exhibit A.

This restriction does not apply to the Company's subsidiaries, nor will it prevent any of them from creating or permitting to exist Liens on their property or assets to secure any Secured Debt. In addition, this restriction does not prevent the creation or existence of:     (a)   Liens on property existing at the time of acquisition or construction of such property (or created within one year after completion of such acquisition or construction), whether by purchase, merger, construction or otherwise, or to secure the payment of all or any part of the purchase price or construction cost thereof, including the extension of any Liens to repairs, renewals, replacements, substitutions, betterments, additions, extensions and improvements then or thereafter made on the property subject thereto;     (b)   Financing of the Company's accounts receivable for electric service;     (c)   Any extensions, renewals or replacements (or successive extensions, renewals or replacements), in whole or in part, of liens permitted by the foregoing clauses; and     (d)   The pledge of any bonds or other securities at any time issued under any of the Secured Debt permitted by the above clauses. In addition to the permitted issuances above, Secured Debt not otherwise so permitted may be issued in an amount that does not exceed 15% of Net Tangible Assets as defined below. "Net Tangible Assets" means the total of all assets (including revaluations thereof as a result of commercial appraisals, price level restatement or otherwise) appearing on the Company's balance sheet, net of applicable reserves and deductions, but excluding goodwill, trade names, trademarks, patents, unamortized debt discount and all other like intangible assets (which term shall not be construed to include such revaluations), less the aggregate of the Company's current liabilities appearing on such balance sheet. For purposes of this definition, the Company's balance sheet does not include assets and liabilities of its subsidiaries. This restriction also does not apply to or prevent the creation or existence of leases made, or existing on property acquired, in the ordinary course of business. SECTION 205.    Place of Payment. The Place of Payment in respect of the Series J Notes will be at the principal office or place of business of the Trustee or its successor in trust under the Indenture, which, at the date hereof, is located at 2 North LaSalle Street, Chicago, IL 60602, Attention: Corporate Trust Administration. SECTION 206.    Optional Redemption. The Series J Notes may be redeemed at the Company's option at any time upon no more than 60 and not less than 30 days' notice by mail. At any time prior to October 1, 2044, the Company may redeem the Series J Notes either as a whole or in part at a redemption price equal to the greater of (1) 100% of the principal amount of the Series J Notes being redeemed and (2) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the Series J Notes being redeemed (excluding the portion of any such interest accrued to but excluding the date of redemption) discounted (for purposes of determining present value) to the redemption date on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Treasury Rate (as defined below) plus 25 basis points, plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest thereon to but excluding the date of redemption.  At any time on or after October 1, 2044, the Company may redeem the Series J Notes in whole or in part at 100% of the principal amount of the Series J Notes being redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to but excluding the date of redemption. "Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security selected by an Independent Investment Banker as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term ("remaining life") of the Series J Notes that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining life of the Series J Notes. "Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to any redemption date, (1) the average of the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such redemption date, after excluding the highest and lowest of such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or (2) if the Company obtains fewer than four of such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all such quotations. "Independent Investment Banker" means one of the Reference Treasury Dealers appointed by the Company and notified by the Company to the Trustee. "Reference Treasury Dealer" means a primary UxxPDSxxPD Government securities dealer or dealers selected by the Company and notified by the Company to the Trustee. "Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any redemption date, the average, as determined by the Company and notified to the Trustee, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Company and the Trustee by such Reference Treasury Dealer at or before 3:30 pxxPDmxxPD, New York City time, on the third Business Day preceding such redemption date. "Treasury Rate" means, with respect to any redemption, the rate per annum equal to the semiannual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue, calculated using a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such redemption date. SECTION 207.    Sinking Funds. Article Twelve of the Indenture shall not apply to the Series J Notes. SECTION 208.    Regular Record Date. The "Regular Record Date" will be the March 15 or September 15, as the case may be, next preceding an interest payment date (whether or not a Business Day). ARTICLE THREE Miscellaneous SECTION 301.    Execution as Supplemental Indenture. This Tenth Supplemental Indenture is executed and shall be construed as an indenture supplemental to the Original Indenture and, as provided in the Original Indenture, this Tenth Supplemental Indenture forms a part thereof. SECTION 302.    Conflict with Trust Indenture Act. If any provision hereof limits, qualifies or conflicts with another provision hereof which is required to be included in this Tenth Supplemental Indenture by any of the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act, such required provision shall control. SECTION 303.    Effect of Headings. The Article and Section headings herein are for convenience only and shall not affect the construction hereof. SECTION 304.    Successors and Assigns. All covenants and agreements by the Company in this Tenth Supplemental Indenture shall bind its successors and assigns, whether so expressed or not. SECTION 305.    Separability Clause. In case any provision in this Tenth Supplemental Indenture or in the Series J Notes shall be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby. SECTION 306.    Benefits of Tenth Supplemental Indenture. Nothing in this Tenth Supplemental Indenture or in the Series J Notes, express or implied, shall give to any Person, other than the parties hereto and their successors hereunder and the Holders, any benefit or any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under this Tenth Supplemental Indenture. SECTION 307.    Execution and Counterparts. This Tenth Supplemental Indenture may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all such counterparts shall together constitute but one and the same instrument. SECTION 308. Certain Tax Information. In order to comply with applicable tax laws (inclusive of rules, regulations and interpretations promulgated by competent authorities) related to the Original Indenture, this Tenth Supplemental Indenture and the Series J Notes in effect from time to time ("Applicable Law") that a foreign financial institution, issuer, trustee, paying agent or other party is or has agreed to be subject to, the Company agrees (i) to provide to the Trustee sufficient information about the parties and/or transactions (including any modification to the terms of such transactions) so the Trustee can determine whether it has tax related obligations under Applicable Law and (ii) that the Trustee shall be entitled to make any withholding or deduction from payments to the extent necessary to comply with Applicable Law for which the Trustee shall not have any liability. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Tenth Supplemental Indenture to be duly executed and attested, all as of the day and year first above written. SOUTHWESTERN ELECTRIC POWER COMPANY By:     /s/ Renee V.

The provisions of this Security, together with the provisions of the Indenture, shall govern the rights, obligations, duties and immunities of the Holder, the Company and the Trustee with respect to this Security, provided that, if any provision of this Security necessarily conflicts with any provision of the Indenture, the provision of this Security shall be controlling to the fullest extent permitted under the Indenture. The Securities of this Series are subject to redemption upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' notice by mail to the Holders of such Securities at their addresses in the Security Register for such Series.

The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of specified percentages in principal amount of the Securities of each Series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Security and of any Security issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security. No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Security or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on this Security at the times, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed. This Security shall be exchangeable for Securities registered in the names of Persons other than the Depositary with respect to such series or its nominee only as provided in the Indenture.

Securities so issued in exchange for this Security shall be of the same series, having the same interest rate, if any, and maturity and having the same terms as this Security, in authorized denominations and in the aggregate having the same principal amount as this Security and registered in such names as the Depositary for such Global Security shall direct. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of a Security of the series of which this Security is a part is registrable in the Security Register, upon surrender of this Security for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Company in any place where the principal of and any premium and interest on this Security are payable, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Security Registrar duly executed by, the Holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Securities of this Series and of like tenor, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees. The Securities of this Series are issuable only in registered form without coupons in denominations of $1,000 and integral multiples in excess thereof. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Securities of this Series are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Securities of this Series and of like tenor of any authorized denomination, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same. No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith. Prior to due presentment of this Security for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Security is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Security be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary. For so long as this Security is issued in the form of a Global Security, any notice to be given to the Holder of this Security shall be deemed to have been duly given to such Holder when given to the Depositary, or its nominee, in accordance with its Applicable Procedures. Neither the Company nor the Trustee will have any responsibility with respect to those policies and procedures or for any notices or other communications among the Depositary, its direct and indirect participants and the beneficial owners of this Security in global form. If at any time this Security is not represented by a Global Security, any notice to be given to the Holder of this Security shall be deemed to have been duly given to such Holder upon the mailing of such notice to the Holder at such Holder's address as it appears on the Security Register maintained by the Company or its agent as of the close of business preceding the day such notice is given. Neither the failure to give any notice nor any defect in any notice given to the Holder of this Security or any other Security of this series will affect the sufficiency of any notice given to another Holder of any Securities of this series. The Indenture provides that the Company, at its option, (a) will be discharged from any and all obligations in respect of the Securities (except for certain obligations to register the transfer or exchange of Securities, replace stolen, lost or mutilated Securities, maintain paying agencies and hold moneys for payment in trust) or (b) need not comply with certain restrictive covenants of the Indenture, in each case if the Company deposits, in trust, with the Trustee money or UxxPDSxxPD Government Obligations which, through the payment of interest thereon and principal thereof in accordance with their terms, will provide money, in an amount sufficient to pay all the principal of, and premium, if any, and interest, if any, on the Securities on the dates such payments are due in accordance with the terms of such Securities, and certain other conditions are satisfied. No recourse shall be had for the payment of the principal of or the interest on this Security, or for any claim based hereon, or otherwise in respect hereof, or based on or in respect of the Indenture or any indenture supplemental thereto, against any incorporator, organizer, member, limited partner, stockholder, officer or director, as such, past, present or future, of the Company or any successor Person, whether by virtue of any constitution, statute or rule of law, or by the enforcement of any assessment or penalty or otherwise, all such liability being, by the acceptance hereof and as part of the consideration for the issuance hereof, expressly waived and released. This Security shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York without regard to principles of conflict of law except Section 5-1401 of the New York General Obligations Law. All terms used in this Security which are defined in the Indenture shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Indenture. Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by the Trustee referred to herein by manual signature, this Security shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Southwestern Electric Power Company has caused this instrument to be duly executed.     SOUTHWESTERN ELECTRIC POWER COMPANY     By:   ____________         Treasurer This is one of the Securities of the series designated herein and referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture. Dated: March 26, 2015   THE BANK OF NEW YORK MELLON TRUST COMPANY, NxxPDAxxPD     By:   _______________________         Authorized Signatory FOR VALUE RECEIVED, the undersigned hereby sell(s), assign(s) and transfer(s) unto (PLEASE INSERT SOCIAL SECURITY OR OTHER    IDENTIFYING NUMBER OF ASSIGNEE) _______________________________________ ________________________________________________________________ ________________________________________________________________ (PLEASE PRINT OR TYPE NAME AND ADDRESS, INCLUDING ZIP CODE, OF ________________________________________________________________ ASSIGNEE) the within Note and all rights thereunder, hereby ________________________________________________________________ irrevocably constituting and appointing such person attorney to ________________________________________________________________ transfer such Note on the books of the Issuer, with full ________________________________________________________________ power of substitution in the premises. Dated:________________________        _________________________ NOTICE:    The signature to this assignment must correspond with the name as written upon the face of the within Note in every particular, without alteration or enlargement or any change whatever and NOTICE: Signature(s) must be guaranteed by a financial institution that is a member of the Securities Transfer Agents Medallion Program ("STAMP"), the Stock Exchange Medallion Program ("SEMP") or the New York Stock Exchange, Inc.
