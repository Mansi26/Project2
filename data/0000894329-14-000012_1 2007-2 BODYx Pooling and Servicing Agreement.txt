(1) The Discover Card Master Trust I is required to maintain Principal Receivables greater than or equal to the Minimum Principal Receivables Balance. The Minimum Principal Receivables Balance is generally calculated by dividing the Investor Interest by 93%. If the Principal Receivables in the Trust are less than the Minimum Principal Receivables Balance, and Discover Bank fails to assign sufficient Receivables to eliminate the deficiency, then an amortization event would occur.

(2) Only the portion of Trust Collections required to be deposited under the Trust's Required Daily Deposit provisions will typically be deposited in the Trust Collections Account each month, and these required amounts may vary markedly from month to month depending on whether any Investor Certificates are maturing on the following distribution date (in which case additional Principal Collections are retained in such account). Accordingly, the amount deposited in the account is not meaningful as an indicator of Trust performance.

(3) Investors should refer only to the higher of the Group Excess Spread Percentage (Item 17(a)) and the Series Excess Spread Percentage (Item 17(c)) in assessing the current performance of the Trust and the Receivables. An amortization event occurs if both the three-month rolling average Group and Series Excess Spreads are less than zero. If necessary, the Trust will use funds available from series or subseries with positive Series Excess Spreads to cover expenses for series or subseries, if any, with negative Series Excess Spreads. Funds remaining after reallocation are distributed to Discover Bank for its general use in its regular course of business.

(4) Group Excess Spread is the sum of the Series Excess Spreads for each series, including each subseries, in the Group. The Group Excess Spread Percentage isequal to the Group Excess Spread, multiplied by twelve and divided by the Series Investor Interests at the beginning of the period for each series, including each subseries, in the Group. For purposes of calculating the Group Excess Spread, Series Excess Spread for Series 2009-SD, applicable through the distribution datein January 2012, included the Principal Collections available to other series in Group One through reallocation, except for those Principal Collections included by Series 2007-CC in the calculation of Series Excess Spread for the DiscoverSeries.

(5) Series Excess Spread for this Subseries is the difference between (a) the sum of Finance Charge Collections, Investment Income, and Series Interchange for any Class of this Subseries (see Item 3(c)), and (b) the sum of (i) the monthly interest for this Subseries (see"Deposits into the SIFA on this Distribution Date" in Item 6), (ii) the monthly servicing fee for this Subseries (see Item12(b)), (iii) the Investor Charged-Off Amount (see Item 8(b)), and (iv) the Credit Enhancement Fee (see Item 15(d)), in each case for this Distribution Date. The Series Excess Spread Percentage is equal to the Series Excess Spread, multiplied by twelve and divided by the Series Investor Interest for this Subseries as of the beginning of the related due period.

(6) For purposes of allocations to investors, all recoveries are treated as Finance Charge Collections and are included as such in Item 3 above.

(7) Group coupon interest is the sum of the monthly interest deposited into the series interest funding accounts for all series and subseries in Group One, including Series 2007-CC, the DiscoverSeries, and relating to the current interest accrual period.
