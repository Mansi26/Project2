		 			WHEREAS, all things necessary to make the Notes, when executed by the Issuer and authenticated and delivered by the Indenture Trustee hereunder, the valid non-recourse obligations of the Issuer, and to make this Indenture a valid agreement of the Issuer, in accordance with its terms, have been done;		
		 			WHEREAS, the Servicer has agreed to service and administer the Timeshare Loans securing the Notes and the Backup Servicer has agreed to, among other things, service and administer the Timeshare Loans if the Servicer shall no longer be the Servicer hereunder;		
		 			WHEREAS, the Club Trustee is a limited purpose entity which, on behalf of Beneficiaries of the Club, holds title to the Timeshare Properties related to the Club Loans.		
		 			NOW, THEREFORE, THIS INDENTURE WITNESSETH:		
		 			For and in consideration of the premises and the purchase of the Notes by the holders thereof, it is mutually covenanted and agreed, for the benefit of the Noteholders, as follows:		
		 			GRANTING CLAUSE		
		 			To secure the payment of the principal of and interest on the Notes in accordance with their terms, the payment of all of the sums payable under this Indenture and the performance of the covenants contained in this Indenture, the Issuer hereby Grants to the Indenture Trustee, for the benefit of the Noteholders, all of the Issuer's right, title and interest in and to the following whether now owned or hereafter acquired and any and all benefits accruing to the Issuer from, (i) the Initial Timeshare Loans specified on Schedule I hereto, (ii) any 		
				 			 		
		 Subsequent Timeshare Loans, (iii) any Qualified Substitute Timeshare Loans, (iv) the Receivables in respect of each Timeshare Loan due after the related Cut-Off Date, (v) the related Timeshare Loan Documents (excluding any rights as developer or declarant under the Timeshare Declaration, the Timeshare Program Consumer Documents or the Timeshare Program Governing Documents), (vi) all Related Security in respect of each Timeshare Loan, (vii) all rights and remedies under the Transfer Agreement, the Bluegreen Purchase Agreement, the Sale Agreement, the Backup Servicing Agreement, the Lockbox Agreement, the Administration Agreement, the Remarketing Agreement and the Custodial Agreement, (viii) all amounts properly deposited into the Lockbox Account (after the related Cut-Off Date), the Collection Account, the General Reserve Account, the Prefunding Account, the Capitalized Interest Account and the Force Majeure Loan Reserve Account, and (ix) proceeds of the foregoing (including, without limitation, all cash proceeds, accounts, accounts receivable, notes, drafts, acceptances, chattel paper, checks, deposit accounts, insurance proceeds (as applicable), condemnation awards, rights to payment of any and every kind, and other forms of obligations and receivables which at any time constitute all or part or are included in the proceeds of any of the foregoing) (collectively, the "Trust Estate";).  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Trust Estate shall not include (i) any Timeshare Loan released from the Lien of this Indenture in accordance with the terms hereof and any Related Security, Timeshare Loan Documents, income or proceeds related to such released Timeshare Loan, (ii) any amount distributed pursuant to Section 3.4 or Section 6.6 hereof or (iii) any Misdirected Deposits.		
		 			Such Grant is made in trust to secure (i) the payment of all amounts due on the Notes in accordance with their terms, equally and ratably except as otherwise may be provided in this Indenture, without prejudice, priority, or distinction between any Note of a Class and any other Note of the same Class by reason of differences in time of issuance or otherwise, and (ii) the payment of all other sums payable under the Notes and this Indenture.  		
		 			The Indenture Trustee acknowledges such Grant, accepts the trusts hereunder in accordance with the provisions hereof, and agrees to perform the duties herein required to the best of its ability and to the end that the interests of the Noteholders may be adequately and effectively protected as hereinafter provided.		
		 			The Custodian shall hold the Timeshare Loan Files in trust, for the use and benefit of the Issuer and all present and future Noteholders, and shall retain possession thereof.  The Custodian further agrees and acknowledges that each other item making up the Trust Estate that is physically delivered to the Custodian will be held by the Custodian in the State of Minnesota or in any other location acceptable to the Indenture Trustee and the Servicer.		
		 			The Indenture Trustee further acknowledges that in the event that a court of competent jurisdiction were to hold that the conveyance of the Timeshare Loans by the Depositor to the Issuer pursuant to the Sale Agreement constitutes a loan and not a sale as it is intended by all the parties hereto, the Custodian will be holding each of the Timeshare Loans as bailee of the Issuer; provided,  however, that with respect to the Timeshare Loans, the Custodian will not act at the direction of the Issuer without the written consent of the Indenture Trustee.		
				 			 		
		    			 				ARTICLE I.			DEFINITIONS AND OTHER PROVISIONSOF GENERAL APPLICATION
		    			 				 SECTION 1.1. 			General Definitions and Usage of Terms.
		    			 				 (a) 			In addition to the terms defined elsewhere in this Indenture, capitalized terms shall have the meanings given them in the Standard Definitions attached hereto as Annex A.
		    			 				 (b) 			With respect to all terms in this Indenture, the singular includes the plural and the plural the singular; words importing any gender include the other genders; references to "writing"; include printing, typing, lithography and other means of reproducing words in a visible form; references to agreements and other contractual instruments include all amendments, modifications and supplements thereto or any changes therein entered into in accordance with their respective terms and not prohibited by this Indenture; references to Persons include their successors and assigns; and the term "including"; means "including without limitation";.
		    			 				 SECTION 1.2. 			Compliance Certificates and Opinions.
		 			Upon any written application or request (or oral application with prompt written or confirmable electronic means) by the Issuer to the Indenture Trustee to take any action under any provision of this Indenture, other than any request that (a) the Indenture Trustee authenticate the Notes specified in such request, (b) the Indenture Trustee invest moneys in any of the Trust Accounts pursuant to the written directions specified in such request or (c) the Indenture Trustee pay moneys due and payable to the Issuer hereunder to the Issuer's assignee specified in such request, the Indenture Trustee shall require the Issuer to furnish to the Indenture Trustee an Officer's Certificate stating that all conditions precedent, if any, provided for in this Indenture relating to the proposed action have been complied with and that the request otherwise is in accordance with the terms of this Indenture, and an Opinion of Counsel stating that in the opinion of such counsel all such conditions precedent, if any, have been complied with, except that, in the case of any such requested action as to which other evidence of satisfaction of the conditions precedent thereto is specifically required by any provision of this Indenture, no additional certificate or opinion need be furnished.		
		    			 				 SECTION 1.3. 			Form of Documents Delivered to Indenture Trustee.
		 			In any case where several matters are required to be certified by, or covered by an opinion of, any specified Person, it is not necessary that all such matters be certified by, or covered by the opinion of, only one such Person, or that they be so certified or covered by only one document, but one such Person may certify or give an opinion with respect to some matters and one or more other such Persons as to other matters, and any such Person may certify or give an opinion as to such matters in one or several documents.		
		 			Any certificate or opinion of an officer of the Issuer delivered to the Indenture Trustee may be based, insofar as it relates to legal matters, upon an Opinion of Counsel, unless such officer knows that such Opinion of Counsel with respect to the matters upon which his/her 		
				 			 		
		 certificate or opinion is based is erroneous.  Any such officer's certificate or opinion and any Opinion of Counsel may be based, insofar as it relates to factual matters, upon a certificate or opinion of, or representations by, an officer or officers of the Issuer as to such factual matters unless such officer or counsel knows that the certificate or opinion or representations with respect to such matters is erroneous.  Any Opinion of Counsel may be based on the written opinion of other counsel, in which event such Opinion of Counsel shall be accompanied by a copy of such other counsel's opinion and shall include a statement to the effect that such other counsel believes that such counsel and the Indenture Trustee may reasonably rely upon the opinion of such other counsel.		
		 			Where any Person is required to make, give or execute two or more applications, requests, consents, certificates, statements, opinions or other instruments under this Indenture, they may, but need not, be consolidated and form one instrument.		
		 			Wherever in this Indenture, in connection with any application or certificate or report to the Indenture Trustee, it is provided that the Issuer shall deliver any document as a condition of the granting of such application, or as evidence of compliance with any term hereof, it is intended that the truth and accuracy, at the time of the granting of such application or at the effective date of such certificate or report (as the case may be), of the facts and opinions stated in such document shall in such case be conditions precedent to the right of the Issuer to have such application granted or to the sufficiency of such certificate or report.  The foregoing shall not, however, be construed to affect the Indenture Trustee's right to rely upon the truth and accuracy of any statement or opinion contained in any such document as provided in Section 7.1(b) hereof.		
		 			Whenever in this Indenture it is provided that the absence of the occurrence and continuation of a Default, Event of Default or Servicer Event of Default is a condition precedent to the taking of any action by the Indenture Trustee at the request or direction of the Issuer, then, notwithstanding that the satisfaction of such condition is a condition precedent to the Issuer's right to make such request or direction, the Indenture Trustee shall be protected in acting in accordance with such request or direction if it does not have Knowledge of the occurrence and continuation of such event.  For all purposes of this Indenture, the Indenture Trustee shall not be deemed to have Knowledge of any Default, Event of Default or Servicer Event of Default nor shall the Indenture Trustee have any duty to monitor or investigate to determine whether a default has occurred (other than an Event of Default of the kind described in Section 6.1(a) hereof) or Servicer Event of Default has occurred unless a Responsible Officer of the Indenture Trustee shall have Knowledge thereof or shall have been notified in writing thereof by the Issuer, the Servicer or any secured party.		
		    			 				 SECTION 1.4. 			Acts of Noteholders, etc.
		    			 				 (a) 			Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action provided by this Indenture to be given or taken by Noteholders may be embodied in and evidenced by one or more instruments of substantially similar tenor signed by such Noteholders in person or by agents duly appointed in writing; and, except as herein otherwise expressly provided, such action shall become effective when such instrument or instruments are delivered to the Indenture Trustee and, where it is hereby expressly required, to the Issuer.  Such 				    		 			4				 			 		
		 instrument or instruments (and the action embodied therein and evidenced thereby) are herein sometimes referred to as the "Act"; of the Noteholders signing such instrument or instruments.  Proof of execution of any such instrument or of a writing appointing any such agent shall be sufficient for any purpose of this Indenture and (subject to Section 7.1 hereof) conclusive in favor of the Indenture Trustee and the Issuer, if made in the manner provided in this Section 1.4.
		    			 				 (b) 			The fact and date of the execution by any Person of any such instrument or writing may be proved by the affidavit of a witness of such execution or by a certificate of a notary public or other officer authorized by law to take acknowledgments of deeds, certifying that the individual signing such instrument or writing acknowledged to him the execution thereof.  Where such execution is by a signer acting in a capacity other than his individual capacity, such certificate or affidavit shall also constitute sufficient proof of his authority.  The fact and date of the execution of any such instrument or writing, or the authority of the Person executing the same, may also be proved in any other manner which the Indenture Trustee deems sufficient.
		    			 				 (c) 			Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other Act of the holder of any Note shall bind every future holder of the same Note and the holder of every Note issued upon the registration of transfer thereof or in exchange therefor or in lieu thereof in respect of anything done, omitted or suffered to be done by the Indenture Trustee or the Issuer in reliance thereon, whether or not notation of such action is made upon such Note.
		    			 				 (d) 			By accepting the Notes issued pursuant to this Indenture, each Noteholder irrevocably appoints the Indenture Trustee hereunder as the special attorney-in-fact for such Noteholder vested with full power on behalf of such Noteholder to effect and enforce the rights of such Noteholder for the benefit of such Noteholder; provided, that nothing contained in this Section 1.4(d) shall be deemed to confer upon the Indenture Trustee any duty or power to vote on behalf of the Noteholders with respect to any matter on which the Noteholders have a right to vote pursuant to the terms of this Indenture.
		    			 				 SECTION 1.5. 			Notice to Noteholders; Waiver.
		    			 				 (a) 			Where this Indenture provides for notice to Noteholders of any event, or the mailing of any report to Noteholders, such notice or report shall be sufficiently given (unless otherwise herein expressly provided) if in writing and mailed, via first class mail, or sent by private courier or confirmable electronic means to each Noteholder affected by such event or to whom such report is required to be mailed, at its address as it appears in the Note Register, not later than the latest date, and not earlier than the earliest date, prescribed for the giving of such notice or the mailing of such report.  In any case where a notice or report to Noteholders is mailed, neither the failure to mail such notice or report, nor any defect in any notice or report so mailed, to any particular Noteholder shall affect the sufficiency of such notice or report with respect to other Noteholders.  Where this Indenture provides for notice in any manner, such notice may be waived in writing by the Person entitled to receive such notice, either before or after the event, and such waiver shall be the equivalent of such notice.  Waivers of notice by Noteholders shall be filed with the Indenture Trustee, but such filing shall not be a condition precedent to the validity of any action taken in reliance upon such waiver.
				 			 		
		    			 				 (b) 			In case by reason of the suspension of regular mail service or by reason of any other cause it shall be impracticable to mail or send notice to Noteholders, in accordance with Section 1.5(a) hereof, of any event or any report to Noteholders when such notice or report is required to be delivered pursuant to any provision of this Indenture, then such notification or delivery as shall be made with the approval of the Indenture Trustee shall constitute a sufficient notification for every purpose hereunder.
		    			 				 SECTION 1.6. 			Effect of Headings and Table of Contents.
		 			The Article and Section headings herein and in the Table of Contents are for convenience only and shall not affect the construction hereof.		
		    			 				 SECTION 1.7. 			Successors and Assigns.
		 			All covenants and agreements in this Indenture by each of the parties hereto shall bind its respective successors and permitted assigns, whether so expressed or not.		
		    			 				 SECTION 1.8. 			GOVERNING LAW.
		 			THIS INDENTURE AND THE NOTES SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE INTERNAL LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAW OTHER THAN SECTIONS 5-1401 AND 5-1402 OF THE GENERAL OBLIGATIONS LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.  UNLESS MADE APPLICABLE IN A SUPPLEMENT HERETO, THIS INDENTURE IS NOT SUBJECT TO THE TRUST INDENTURE ACT OF 1939, AS AMENDED, AND SHALL NOT BE GOVERNED THEREBY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE THEREWITH.		
		    			 				 SECTION 1.9. 			Legal Holidays.
		 			In any case where any Payment Date or the Stated Maturity or any other date on which principal of or interest on any Note is proposed to be paid shall not be a Business Day, then (notwithstanding any other provision of this Indenture or of the Notes) such payment need not be made on such date, but may be made on the next succeeding Business Day with the same force and effect as if made on such Payment Date, Stated Maturity or other date on which principal of or interest on any Note is proposed to be paid; provided, that no penalty interest shall accrue for the period from and after such Payment Date, Stated Maturity, or any other date on which principal of or interest on any Note is proposed to be paid, as the case may be, until such next succeeding Business Day.		
		    			 				 SECTION 1.10. 			Execution in Counterparts.
		 			This Indenture may be executed in separate counterparts, each of which so executed shall be deemed to be an original, but all such counterparts shall together constitute one and the same agreement.

		    			 				 SECTION 1.11. 			Inspection.
		 			The Issuer agrees that, on ten Business Days' prior notice (or, one Business Day's prior notice after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default or a Servicer Event of Default), it will permit the representatives of the Indenture Trustee or any Noteholder, during the Issuer's normal business hours, to examine all of the books of account, records, reports and other papers of the Issuer, to make copies thereof and extracts therefrom, and to discuss its affairs, finances and accounts with its designated officers, employees and independent accountants in the presence of such designated officers and employees (and by this provision the Issuer hereby authorizes its independent accountants to discuss with such representatives such affairs, finances and accounts), all at such reasonable times and as often as may be reasonably requested for the purpose of reviewing or evaluating the financial condition or affairs of the Issuer or the performance of and compliance with the covenants and undertakings of the Issuer and the Servicer in this Indenture or any of the other documents referred to herein or therein.  Any reasonable expense incident to the exercise by the Indenture Trustee at any time or any Noteholder during the continuance of any Default or Event of Default, of any right under this Section 1.11 shall be borne by the Issuer and distributed in accordance with Section 3.4 or Section 6.6 hereof, as applicable.  Nothing contained herein shall be construed as a duty of the Indenture Trustee to perform such inspection.		
		    			 				 SECTION 1.12. 			Survival of Representations and Warranties.
		 			The representations, warranties and certifications of the Issuer made in this Indenture or in any certificate or other writing delivered by the Issuer pursuant hereto shall survive the authentication and delivery of the Notes hereunder.		
		    			 				ARTICLE II.			THE NOTES
		    			 				 SECTION 2.1. 			General Provisions.
		    			 				 (a) 			Form of Notes.  The Notes shall be designated as the "BXG Receivables Note Trust 2015-A, Timeshare Loan-Backed Notes, Series 2015-A";.  The Notes, together with their certificates of authentication, shall be in substantially the form set forth in Exhibit A attached hereto, with such appropriate insertions, omissions, substitutions and other variations as are required or are permitted by this Indenture, and may have such letters, numbers or other marks of identification and such legends or endorsements placed thereon, as may consistently herewith, be determined by the officer executing such Notes, as evidenced by such officer's execution of such Notes.
		    			 				 (b) 			Denominations.  The Outstanding Note Balance of the Class A Notes and the Class B Notes which may be authenticated and delivered under this Indenture is limited to $89,375,000 and $28,438,000 respectively.  The Notes shall be issuable only as registered Notes, without interest coupons, in the denominations of at least $50,000 and in integral multiples of $1,000; provided,  however, that the foregoing shall not restrict or prevent the transfer in 				    		 			7				 			 		
		 accordance with Section 2.4 hereof of any Note with a remaining Outstanding Note Balance of less than $50,000.
		    			 				 (c) 			Execution, Authentication, Delivery and Dating.  The Notes shall be manually executed by an Authorized Officer of the Owner Trustee on behalf of the Issuer.  Any Note bearing the signature of an individual who was at the time of execution thereof an Authorized Officer of the Owner Trustee on behalf of the Issuer shall bind the Issuer, notwithstanding that such individual ceases to hold such office prior to the authentication and delivery of such Note or did not hold such office at the date of such Note.  No Note shall be entitled to any benefit under this Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose unless there appears on such Note a certificate of authentication substantially in the form set forth in Exhibit A hereto, executed by the Indenture Trustee by manual signature, and such certificate upon any Note shall be conclusive evidence, and the only evidence, that such Note has been duly authenticated and delivered hereunder.  Each Note shall be dated the date of its authentication.  The Notes may from time to time be executed by the Issuer and delivered to the Indenture Trustee for authentication together with an Issuer Order to the Indenture Trustee directing the authentication and delivery of such Notes and thereupon the same shall be authenticated and delivered by the Indenture Trustee in accordance with such Issuer Order.
		    			 				 SECTION 2.2. 			Global Notes.
		 			Each of the Notes, upon original issuance, shall be issued in the form of one or more book-entry global certificates (the "Global Notes"; and each, a "Global Note";) to be deposited with the Indenture Trustee as custodian for The Depository Trust Company, the initial Depository, by or on behalf of the Issuer.  The Notes sold to non-UxxPDSxxPD persons (as defined in Regulation S) in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S will be represented by one or more temporary Global Notes (each, a "Temporary Regulation S Global Notes";).  Upon the expiration of the Restricted Period, interests in a Temporary Regulation S Global Note will be exchangeable for interests in permanent Global Notes of the same Class (together with a Temporary Regulation S Global Note, a "Regulation S Global Note";).  The Notes sold to UxxPDSxxPD Persons which are Qualified Institutional Buyers or, with respect to the Closing Date, Institutional Accredited Investors, will be represented by one or more temporary Global Notes (each, a "Rule 144A Global Note";).  All Global Notes shall be initially registered on the Note Register in the name of Cede & Co., the nominee of The Depository Trust Company, and no Note Owner will receive a definitive note (a "Definitive Note";) representing such Note Owner's interest in the related Class of Notes, except as provided in Section 2.3 hereof.  Unless and until Definitive Notes have been issued in respect of a Class of Notes pursuant to Section 2.3 hereof:		
		    			 				 (a) 			the provisions of this Section 2.2 shall be in full force and effect with respect to such Class of Notes;
		    			 				 (b) 			the Issuer, the Servicer and the Indenture Trustee may deal with the Depository and the Depository Participants for all purposes with respect to such Notes (including the making of distributions on such Notes) as the authorized representatives of the respective Note Owners;
				 			 		
		    			 				 (c) 			to the extent that the provisions of this Section 2.2 conflict with any other provisions of this Indenture, the provisions of this Section 2.2 shall control; and
		    			 				 (d) 			the rights of the respective Note Owners of a Class of Notes shall be exercised only through the Depository and the Depository Participants and shall be limited to those established by law and agreements between the respective Note Owners and the Depository and/or the Depository Participants.  Pursuant to the Depository Agreement, unless and until Definitive Notes are issued in respect of the Notes pursuant to Section 2.3 hereof, the Depository will make book-entry transfers among the Depository Participants and receive and transmit distributions of principal of, and interest on, the Notes to the Depository Participants.
		    			 				 SECTION 2.3. 			Definitive Notes.
		 			If (a) the Issuer advises the Indenture Trustee in writing that the Depository is no longer willing or able to properly discharge its responsibilities as Depository with respect to the Global Notes and the Indenture Trustee or the Issuer is unable to locate a qualified successor, (b) the Issuer, at its sole option, elects to terminate the book-entry system through the Depository with respect to any or all Classes of Notes or (c) after the occurrence of an Event of Default, Note Owners (other than Bluegreen or an Affiliate thereof) evidencing not less than 66-2/3% of the then Adjusted Note Balance of such Class of Global Notes, advise the Indenture Trustee and the Depository through the Depository Participants in writing that the continuation of a book-entry system with respect to such Class of Global Notes, through the Depository is no longer in the best interest of such Note Owners, the Indenture Trustee shall use its best efforts to notify all affected Note Owners through the Depository of the occurrence of any such event and of the availability of Definitive Notes to such Note Owners.  Neither the Issuer nor the Indenture Trustee shall be liable for any delay in delivery of such instructions and may conclusively rely on, and shall be protected in relying on, such instructions.  Upon the issuance of Definitive Notes, the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee, the Note Registrar and the Servicer shall recognize holders of Definitive Notes as Noteholders hereunder.  Upon the issuance of Definitive Notes, all references herein to obligations imposed upon or to be performed by the Depository shall be deemed to be imposed upon and performed by the Indenture Trustee, to the extent applicable with respect to such Definitive Notes. 		
		    			 				 SECTION 2.4. 			Registration, Transfer and Exchange of Notes.
		    			 				 (a) 			The Issuer shall cause to be kept at the Corporate Trust Office a register (the "Note Register";) for the registration, transfer and exchange of Notes.  The Indenture Trustee is hereby appointed "Note Registrar"; for purposes of registering Notes and transfers of Notes as herein provided.  The names and addresses of all Noteholders and the names and addresses of the transferees of any Notes shall be registered in the Note Register; provided,  however, in no event shall the Note Registrar be required to maintain in the Note Register the names of the individual participants holding Notes through the Depository.  The Person in whose name any Note is so registered shall be deemed and treated as the sole owner and Noteholder thereof for all purposes of this Indenture and the Note Registrar, the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee, the Servicer and any agent of any of them shall not be affected by any notice or knowledge to the contrary.  A Definitive Note is transferable or exchangeable only upon the surrender of such Note to the Note Registrar at the Corporate Trust Office together with an 				    		 			9				 			 		
		 assignment and transfer (executed by the Noteholder or his duly authorized attorney), subject to the applicable requirements of this Section 2.4. Upon request of the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee or the Servicer, the Note Registrar shall provide the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee or the Servicer, as applicable, with the names and addresses of the Noteholders.
		    			 				 (b) 			Upon surrender for registration of transfer of any Definitive Note, subject to the applicable requirements of this Section 2.4, the Issuer shall execute and the Indenture Trustee shall duly authenticate in the name of the designated transferee or transferees, one or more Notes in denominations of a like aggregate denomination as the Definitive Note being surrendered.  Each Note surrendered for registration of transfer shall be canceled and consequently destroyed by the Note Registrar.  Each new Note issued pursuant to this Section 2.4 shall be registered in the name of any Person and in the form of Definitive Notes in one of the appropriate forms as the transferring Noteholder may request, subject to the applicable provisions of this Section 2.4.  All Notes issued upon any registration of transfer or exchange of Notes shall be entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as the Notes surrendered upon such registration of transfer or exchange.
		    			 				 (c) 			The issuance of the Notes will not be registered or qualified under the Securities Act or the securities laws of any state.  No resale or transfer of any Note or any interest therein may be made unless such resale or transfer is made pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act and an effective registration or a qualification under applicable state securities laws, or is made in a transaction that does not require such registration or qualification because such transfer satisfies one of the following: (i) such resale or transfer is in compliance with Rule 144A under the Securities Act to a person who the transferor reasonably believes is a Qualified Institutional Buyer that is purchasing for its own account or for the account of a Qualified Institutional Buyer and to whom notice is given that such resale or transfer is being made in reliance upon Rule 144A under the Securities Act (or, on the Closing Date, Institutional Accredited Investors) as certified by such transferee (other than the Initial Purchasers and their respective initial transferees) in a letter in the form of Exhibit B  hereto; (ii) such resale or transfer is in compliance with Regulation S under the Securities Act as certified by such transferee (other than the Initial Purchasers and their respective initial transferees) in a letter in the form of Exhibit B hereto; or (iii) after the appropriate holding period, such resale or transfer is pursuant to an exemption from registration under the Securities Act provided by Rule 144 under the Securities Act, in each case, in accordance with any applicable securities laws of any state of the United States and any other applicable jurisdiction.  Each transferee and each subsequent transferee will be required to notify any subsequent purchaser of such Notes from it of the resale restrictions described herein.  None of the Issuer, the Servicer or the Indenture Trustee is obligated to register or qualify the Notes under the Securities Act or any other securities law or to take any action not otherwise required under this Indenture to permit the transfer of any Note without registration.
		    			 				 (d) 			In addition to the applicable provisions of this Section 2.4 and the rules of the Depository, the exchange, transfer and registration of transfer of Global Notes or interests therein shall only be made in accordance with this Section 2.4(d).
		    			 				 (i)			Rule 144A Global Note to Temporary Regulation S Global Note During the Restricted Period.    If, during the Restricted Period, a Note Owner of an interest in a 				    		 			10				 			 		
		 Rule 144A Global Note wishes at any time to transfer its beneficial interest in such Rule 144A Global Note to a Person who wishes to take delivery thereof in the form of a beneficial interest in a Temporary Regulation S Global Note, such Note Owner may, in addition to complying with all applicable rules and procedures of the Depository and Clearstream or Euroclear applicable to transfers by their respective participants (the "Applicable Procedures";), transfer or cause the transfer of such beneficial interest for an equivalent beneficial interest in the Temporary Regulation S Global Note only upon compliance with the provisions of this Section 2.4(d)(i). Upon receipt by the Note Registrar at its Corporate Trust Office of (A) written instructions given in accordance with the Applicable Procedures from a Depository Participant directing the Note Registrar to credit or cause to be credited to another specified Depository Participant's account a beneficial interest in the Temporary Regulation S Global Note in an amount equal to the denomination of the beneficial interest in the Rule 144A Global Note to be transferred, (B) a written order given in accordance with the Applicable Procedures containing information regarding the account of the Depository Participant to be credited with, and the account of the Depository Participant to be debited for, such beneficial interest, and (C) a certification in the form of Exhibit C hereto given by the Note Owner that is transferring such interest, the Note Registrar shall instruct the Depository, to reduce the denomination of the Rule 144A Global Note by the denomination of the beneficial interest in the Rule 144A Global Note to be so transferred and, concurrently with such reduction, to increase the denomination of the Temporary Regulation S Global Note by the denomination of the beneficial interest in the Rule 144A Global Note to be so transferred, and to credit or cause to be credited to the account of the Person specified in such instructions (who shall be a Depository Participant acting for or on behalf of Euroclear or Clearstream, or both, as the case may be) a beneficial interest in the Temporary Regulation S Global Note having a denomination equal to the amount by which the denomination of the Rule 144A Global Note was reduced upon such transfer.
		    			 				 (ii)			Rule 144A Global Note to Regulation S Global Note After the Restricted Period.    If, after the Restricted Period, a Note Owner of an interest in a Rule 144A Global Note wishes at any time to transfer its beneficial interest in such Rule 144A Global Note to a Person who wishes to take delivery thereof in the form of a beneficial interest in a Regulation S Global Note, such Note Owner may, in addition to complying with all Applicable Procedures, transfer or cause the transfer of such beneficial interest for an equivalent beneficial interest in a Regulation S Global Note only upon compliance with the provisions of this Section 2.4(d)(ii). Upon receipt by the Note Registrar at its Corporate Trust Office of (A) written instructions given in accordance with the Applicable Procedures from a Depository Participant directing the Note Registrar to credit or cause to be credited to another specified Depository Participant's account a beneficial interest in the Regulation S Global Note in an amount equal to the denomination of the beneficial interest in the Rule 144A Global Note to be transferred, (B) a written order given in accordance with the Applicable Procedures containing information regarding the account of the Depository Participant (and, the Euroclear or Clearstream account, as the case may be) to be credited with, and the account of the Depository Participant to be debited for, such beneficial interest, and (C) a certification in the form of Exhibit D hereto given by the Note Owner that is transferring such interest, the Note Registrar shall instruct the Depository, to reduce the denomination of the Rule 				    		 			11				 			 		
		 144A Global Note by the aggregate denomination of the beneficial interest in the Rule 144A Global Note to be so transferred and, concurrently with such reduction, to increase the denomination of the Regulation S Global Note by the aggregate denomination of the beneficial interest in the Rule 144A Global Note to be so transferred, and to credit or cause to be credited to the account of the Person specified in such instructions (who shall be a Depository Participant acting for or on behalf of Euroclear or Clearstream, or both, as the case may be) a beneficial interest in the Regulation S Global Note having a denomination equal to the amount by which the denomination of the Rule 144A Global Note was reduced upon such transfer.
		    			 				 (iii)			Regulation S Global Note to Rule 144A Global Note.    If the Note Owner of an interest in a Regulation S Global Note wishes at any time to transfer its beneficial interest in such Regulation S Global Note to a Person who wishes to take delivery thereof in the form of a beneficial interest in a Rule 144A Global Note, such holder may, in addition to complying with all Applicable Procedures, transfer or cause the transfer of such beneficial interest for an equivalent beneficial interest in a Rule 144A Global Note only upon compliance with the provisions of this Section 2.4(d)(iii). Upon receipt by the Note Registrar at its Corporate Trust Office of (A) written instructions given in accordance with the Applicable Procedures from a Depository Participant directing the Note Registrar to credit or cause to be credited to another specified Depository Participant's account a beneficial interest in the Rule 144A Global Note in an amount equal to the denomination of the beneficial interest in the Regulation S Global Note to be transferred, (B) a written order given in accordance with the Applicable Procedures containing information regarding the account of the Depository Participant to be credited with, and the account of the Depository Participant (or, if such account is held for Euroclear or Clearstream, the Euroclear or Clearstream account, as the case may be) to be debited for such beneficial interest, and (C) with respect to a transfer of a beneficial interest in the Regulation S Global Note for a beneficial interest in the related Rule 144A Global Note (x) during the Restricted Period, a certification in the form of Exhibit E hereto given by the Note Owner, or (y) after the Restricted Period, an Investment Representation Letter in the form of Exhibit B hereto from the transferee to the effect that such transferee is a Qualified Institutional Buyer, the Note Registrar shall instruct the Depository to reduce the denomination of the Regulation S Global Note by the denomination of the beneficial interest in the Regulation S Global Note to be transferred, and, concurrently with such reduction, to increase the denomination of the Rule 144A Global Note by the aggregate denomination of the beneficial interest in the Regulation S Global Note to be so transferred, and to credit or cause to be credited to the account of the Person specified in such instructions (who shall be a Depository Participant acting for or on behalf of Euroclear or Clearstream, or both, as the case may be) a beneficial interest in the Rule 144A Global Note having a denomination equal to the amount by which the denomination of the Regulation S Global Note was reduced upon such transfer.
		    			 				 (iv)			Transfers Within Regulation S Global Notes During Restricted Period.    If, during the Restricted Period, the Note Owner of an interest in a Regulation S Global Note wishes at any time to transfer its beneficial interest in such Note to a Person who wishes to take delivery thereof in the form of a Regulation S Global Note, such Note Owner may transfer or cause the transfer of such beneficial interest for an equivalent beneficial 				    		 			12				 			 		
		 interest in such Regulation S Global Note only upon compliance with the provisions of this Section 2.4(d)(iv) and all Applicable Procedures.  Upon receipt by the Note Registrar at its Corporate Trust Office of (A) written instructions given in accordance with the Applicable Procedures from a Depository Participant directing the Note Registrar to credit or cause to be credited to another specified Depository Participant's account a beneficial interest in such Regulation S Global Note in an amount equal to the denomination of the beneficial interest to be transferred, (B) a written order given in accordance with the Applicable Procedures containing information regarding the account of the Depository Participant to be credited with, and the account of the Depository Participant (or, if such account is held for Euroclear or Clearstream, the Euroclear or Clearstream account, as the case may be) to be debited for, such beneficial interest and (C) a certification in the form of Exhibit F hereto given by the transferee, the Note Registrar shall instruct the Depository to credit or cause to be credited to the account of the Person specified in such instructions (who shall be a Depository Participant acting for or on behalf of Euroclear or Clearstream, or both, as the case may be) a beneficial interest in the Regulation S Global Note having a denomination equal to the amount specified in such instructions by which the account to be debited was reduced upon such transfer.
		    			 				 (e) 			No resale or other transfer of any Note or any interest therein may be made to any purchaser or transferee unless (i) such purchaser or transferee is not, and will not acquire such Note or any interest therein on behalf of or with the assets of, any Benefit Plan or (ii) no "prohibited transaction"; under ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code that is not subject to a statutory, regulatory or administrative exemption and no violation of any substantially similar provision of federal, state or local law will occur in connection with purchaser's or such transferee's acquisition, holding or disposition of such Note or any interest therein.  In addition, neither the Notes nor any interest therein may be purchased by or transferred to any Benefit Plan or person acting on behalf of or with assets of any Benefit Plan unless it represents that it is not sponsored (within the meaning of Section 3(16)(B) of ERISA) by the Issuer, the Depositor, the Originators, the Servicer, the Indenture Trustee, the Owner Trustee, the Administrator, the Paying Agent, the Custodian, the Backup Servicer, the Lockbox Bank or the Initial Purchasers, or by any Affiliate of any such Person.
		    			 				 (f) 			No fee or service charge shall be imposed by the Note Registrar for its services in respect of any registration of transfer or exchange referred to in this Section 2.4.  The Note Registrar may require payment by each transferor of a sum sufficient to cover any tax, expense or other governmental charge payable in connection with any such transfer.
		    			 				 (g) 			None of the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee, the Servicer or the Note Registrar is obligated to register or qualify the Notes under the Securities Act or any other securities law or to take any action not otherwise required under this Indenture to permit the transfer of such Notes without registration or qualification.  Any such Noteholder desiring to effect such transfer shall, and does hereby agree to, indemnify the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee, the Servicer and the Note Registrar against any loss, liability or expense that may result if the transfer is not so exempt or is not made in accordance with such federal and state laws.
				 			 		
		    			 				 (h) 			The Servicer agrees to cause the Issuer, and the Issuer agrees to provide to the Indenture Trustee such information as required under Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act so as to allow resales of Notes to Qualified Institutional Buyers in accordance herewith.
		    			 				 (i) 			The Notes represent the sole obligation of the Issuer payable from the Trust Estate and do not represent the obligations of the Originators, the Servicer, the Depositor, the Backup Servicer, the Owner Trustee, the Indenture Trustee, the Administrator or the Custodian.
		    			 				 (j) 			The Issuer may not, at any time, own any Class of Notes
		    			 				 (k) 			Each Note Owner, by its acceptance of its beneficial interest in a Note, will be deemed to have acknowledged, represented to and agreed with the Issuer and the Initial Purchasers, each of the statements set forth in items 1 through 11 of Exhibit B hereto.
		    			 				 SECTION 2.5. 			Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost and Stolen Notes.
		    			 				 (a) 			If any mutilated Note is surrendered to the Indenture Trustee, the Issuer shall execute and the Indenture Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor a replacement Note of like tenor and principal amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding.
		    			 				 (b) 			If there shall be delivered to the Issuer and the Indenture Trustee (i) evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Note and (ii) such security or indemnity as may be reasonably required by them to save each of them and any agent of either of them harmless then, in the absence of actual notice to the Issuer or the Indenture Trustee that such Note has been acquired by a bona fide purchaser, the Issuer shall execute and upon its request the Indenture Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in lieu of any such destroyed, lost or stolen Note, a replacement Note of like tenor and principal amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding.
		    			 				 (c) 			In case the final installment of principal on any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Note has become or will at the next Payment Date become due and payable, the Issuer, in its discretion, may, instead of issuing a replacement Note, pay such Note.
		    			 				 (d) 			Upon the issuance of any replacement Note under this Section 2.5, the Issuer or the Indenture Trustee may require the payment by the Noteholder of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed as a result of the issuance of such replacement Note.
		    			 				 (e) 			Every replacement Note issued pursuant to this Section 2.5 in lieu of any destroyed, lost or stolen Note shall constitute an original additional contractual obligation of the Issuer, whether or not the destroyed, lost or stolen Note shall be at any time enforceable by anyone, and shall be entitled to all the benefits of this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other Notes duly issued hereunder.
				 			 		
		    			 				 (f) 			The provisions of this Section 2.5 are exclusive and shall preclude (to the extent lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes.
		    			 				 SECTION 2.6. 			Payment of Interest and Principal; Rights Preserved.
		    			 				 (a) 			Any installment of interest or principal, payable on any Note that is punctually paid or duly provided for by or on behalf of the Issuer on the applicable Payment Date shall be paid to the Person in whose name such Note was registered at the close of business on the Record Date for such Payment Date by check mailed to the address specified in the Note Register, or if a Noteholder has provided wire transfer instructions to the Indenture Trustee at least five Business Days prior to the applicable Payment Date, upon the request of a Noteholder, by wire transfer of federal funds to the account and number specified in the Note Register, in each case on such Record Date for such Person (which shall be, as to each original purchaser of the Notes, the account and number specified by such purchaser to the Indenture Trustee in writing, or, if no such account or number is so specified, then by check mailed to such Person's address as it appears in the Note Register on such Record Date).
		    			 				 (b) 			All reductions in the principal amount of a Note effected by payments of principal made on any Payment Date shall be binding upon all Noteholders of such Note and of any Note issued upon the registration of transfer thereof or in exchange therefor or in lieu thereof, whether or not such payment is noted on such Note.  All payments on the Notes shall be paid without any requirement of presentment, but each Noteholder of any Note shall be deemed to agree, by its acceptance of the same, to surrender such Note at the Corporate Trust Office within 30 days after receipt of the final principal payment of such Note.  Payment at or following the Stated Maturity of any Definitive Note, however, will be made only upon presentation and surrender of such Definitive Note at the office or agency specified in the notice of final payment mailed to the Noteholders, including the office of any paying agent specified in such notice.
		    			 				 (c) 			All outstanding principal of each Note (unless sooner paid) will be due and payable on the Stated Maturity of such Note
		    			 				 SECTION 2.7. 			Persons Deemed Owners.
		 			Prior to due presentment of a Note for registration of transfer, the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee, and any agent of the Issuer or the Indenture Trustee may treat the registered Noteholder as the owner of such Note for the purpose of receiving payment of principal of and interest on such Note and for all other purposes whatsoever, whether or not payment on such Note is overdue, and neither the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee, nor any agent of the Issuer or the Indenture Trustee shall be affected by notice to the contrary.		
		    			 				 SECTION 2.8. 			Cancellation.
		 			All Notes surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange or following final payment shall, if surrendered to any Person other than the Indenture Trustee, be delivered to the Indenture Trustee and shall be promptly canceled by it.  The Issuer may at any time deliver to the Indenture Trustee for cancellation any Notes previously authenticated and delivered hereunder which the Issuer may have acquired in any manner whatsoever, and all Notes so delivered shall 		
				 			 		
		 be promptly canceled by the Indenture Trustee.  No Notes shall be authenticated in lieu of or in exchange for any Notes canceled as provided in this Section 2.8, except as expressly permitted by this Indenture.  All canceled Notes held by the Indenture Trustee may be disposed of in the normal course of its business or as directed by an Issuer Order.		
		    			 				 SECTION 2.9. 			Noteholder Lists.
		 			The Indenture Trustee shall preserve in as current a form as is reasonably practicable the most recent list available to it of the names and addresses of the Noteholders.

		    			 				 SECTION 2.10. 			Treasury Notes.
		 			In determining whether the Noteholders of the required Outstanding Note Balance  or the Adjusted Note Balance of the Notes have concurred in any direction, waiver or consent, Notes held or redeemed by the Issuer or any other obligor in respect of the Notes or held by an Affiliate of the Issuer or such other obligor shall be considered as though not Outstanding, except that for the purposes of determining whether the Indenture Trustee shall be protected in relying on any such direction, waiver or consent, only Notes which a Responsible Officer of the Indenture Trustee knows are so owned shall be so disregarded.		
		    			 				 SECTION 2.11. 			Notice to Depository.

For so long as Bluegreen or any of its Affiliates controls the Timeshare Association for a Resort, and Bluegreen or an Affiliate thereof is the manager, the related management contract and master marketing and sale contract, if applicable, may be amended or modified in a manner that reasonably may be determined to have a material adverse effect on the Noteholders only with the prior written consent of the Noteholders representing at least 66-2/3% of the Adjusted Note Balance of each Class of Notes, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
		    			 				 (f) 			In the event any Lien (other than a Permitted Lien) attaches to any Timeshare Loan or related collateral from any Person claiming from and through Bluegreen or one of its Affiliates which materially adversely affects the Issuer's interest in such Timeshare Loan, Bluegreen shall, within the earlier to occur of ten Business Days after such attachment or the respective lienholders' action to foreclose on such lien, either (i) cause such Lien to be released of record, (ii) provide the Indenture Trustee with a bond in accordance with the applicable laws of the state in which the Timeshare Property is located, issued by a corporate surety acceptable to the Indenture Trustee, in an amount and in form reasonably acceptable to the Indenture Trustee or (iii) provide the Indenture Trustee with such other security as the Indenture Trustee may reasonably require.
		    			 				 (g) 			The Servicer shall: (i) promptly notify the Indenture Trustee of (A) any claim, action or proceeding which may be reasonably expected to have a material adverse effect on the Trust Estate, or any material part thereof, and (B) any action, suit, proceeding, order or injunction of which Servicer becomes aware after the date hereof pending or threatened against or affecting Servicer or any Affiliate which may be reasonably expected to have a material adverse effect on the Trust Estate or the Servicer's ability to service the same; (ii) at the request of Indenture Trustee with respect to a claim or action or proceeding which arises from or through the Servicer or one of its Affiliates, appear in and defend, at Servicer's expense, any such claim, action or proceeding which would have a material adverse effect on the Timeshare Loans or the Servicer's ability to service the same; and (iii) comply in all respects, and shall cause all Affiliates to comply in all respects, with the terms of any orders imposed on such Person by any governmental authority the failure to comply with which would have a material adverse effect on the Timeshare Loans or the Servicer's ability to service the same.
		    			 				 (h) 			Except as contemplated by the Transaction Documents, the Servicer shall not, and shall not permit the Club Managing Entity to, encumber, pledge or otherwise grant a 				    		 			37				 			 		
		 Lien or security interest in and to the Reservation System (including, without limitation, all hardware, software and data in respect thereof) and furthermore agrees, and shall cause the Club Managing Entity, to use commercially reasonable efforts to keep the Reservation System operational, not to dispose of the same and to allow the Club the use of, and access to, the Reservation System in accordance with the terms of the Club Management Agreement.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, should the Club Managing Entity determine that it is desirable to replace the existing hardware and software related to the Reservation System, it will be allowed to enter into a lease or finance arrangement in connection with the lease or purchase of such hardware and software.
		    			 				 (i) 			The Servicer shall comply in all material respects with the Collection Policy in effect on the Closing Date (or, as amended from time to time with the consent of the Noteholders representing at least 66-2/3% of the Adjusted Note Balance of each Class of Notes) and with the terms of the Timeshare Loans.
		    			 				 (j) 			At the written request of a Rating Agency, the Servicer shall prepare and deliver to such Rating Agency, updated replines in the format set forth in the Offering Circular.

		    			 				 (ii)			any failure by the Servicer to provide any required report within five Business Days of when such report is required to be delivered hereunder; provided,  however, that the period within which the Servicer shall provide any report shall be extended to such longer period as is appropriate in the event of a Force Majeure Delay, provided,  further, that such longer period shall not exceed ten Business Days;
		    			 				 (iii)			any failure by the Servicer to observe or perform in any material respect any other covenant or agreement which has a material adverse effect on the Noteholders and such failure is not remedied within 30 days (or, if the Servicer shall have provided evidence satisfactory to the Indenture Trustee that such covenant cannot be cured in the 30-day period and that it is diligently pursuing a cure, 60 days), after the earlier of (x) the Servicer first acquiring Knowledge thereof and (y) the Indenture Trustee's giving written notice thereof to the Servicer;
		    			 				 (iv)			any representation or warranty made by the Servicer in this Indenture shall prove to be incorrect in any material respect as of the time when the same shall have been made, and such breach is not remedied within 30 days (or, if the Servicer shall have provided evidence satisfactory to the Indenture Trustee that such breach 				    		 			38				 			 		
		 cannot be cured in the 30-day period and that it is diligently pursuing a cure, 60 days) after the earlier of (x) the Servicer first acquiring Knowledge thereof and (y) the Indenture Trustee's giving written notice thereof to the Servicer;
		    			 				 (v)			the entry by a court having competent jurisdiction in respect of the Servicer of (i) a decree or order for relief in respect of the Servicer in an involuntary case or proceeding under any applicable federal or state bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, or other similar law or (ii) a decree or order adjudging the Servicer a bankrupt or insolvent, or approving as properly filed a petition seeking reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, or composition of or in respect of the Servicer under any applicable federal or state law, or appointing a custodian, receiver, liquidator, assignee, trustee, sequestrator, or other similar official of the Servicer, or of any substantial part of its property, or ordering the winding up or liquidation of its affairs, and the continuance of any such decree or order for relief or any such other decree or order unstayed and in effect for a period of 60 consecutive days;
		    			 				 (vi)			the commencement by the Servicer of a voluntary case or proceeding under any applicable federal or state bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, or other similar law or of any other case or proceeding to be adjudicated a bankrupt or insolvent, or the consent by either to the entry of a decree or order for relief in respect of the Servicer in an involuntary case or proceeding under any applicable federal or state bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, or other similar law or to the commencement of any bankruptcy or insolvency case or proceeding against it, or the filing by it of a petition or answer or consent seeking reorganization or relief under any applicable federal or state law, or the consent by it to the filing of such petition or to the appointment of or taking possession by a custodian, receiver, liquidator, assignee, trustee, sequestrator, or similar official of the Servicer or of any substantial part of its property, or the making by it of an assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the Servicer's failure to pay its debts generally as they become due, or the taking of corporate action by the Servicer in furtherance of any such action; or
		    			 				 (vii)			a Trigger Event that remains uncured for three consecutive Due Periods.
		 			If any Servicer Event of Default shall have occurred and not been waived hereunder or there shall have been a material default by the Servicer of a material obligation of the Servicer for which (i) the Servicer has received written notice of such default, (ii) such default has not been cured by the Servicer or waived in writing and the period for cure has expired and (iii) such default would result in a liability to the Servicer in excess of 5% of the Servicer's consolidated equity at such time as determined in accordance with GAAP, the Indenture Trustee may, and upon notice from Noteholders representing at least 66-2/3% of the Adjusted Note Balance of each Class of Notes shall, terminate, on behalf of the Noteholders, by notice in writing to the Servicer, all of the rights and obligations of the Servicer (other than any obligations of the Servicer that, pursuant to the Transaction Documents, are intended to survive termination), as Servicer under this Indenture.  The Indenture Trustee shall immediately give written notice of such termination to the Backup Servicer. 		
		 		
				 			 		
		 Unless consented to by the Noteholders representing at least 66-2/3% of the Adjusted Note Balance of each Class of Notes, the Issuer may not waive any Servicer Event of Default. 		
		    			 				 (b) 			Replacement of Servicer.  From and after the receipt by the Servicer of such written termination notice or the resignation of the Servicer pursuant to Section 5.10 hereof, all authority and power of the Servicer under this Indenture, whether with respect to the Timeshare Loans or otherwise, shall, pass to and be vested in the Indenture Trustee, and the Indenture Trustee shall be the successor Servicer hereunder and the duties and obligations of the Servicer shall terminate.  The Servicer shall perform such actions as are reasonably necessary to assist the Indenture Trustee and the Backup Servicer in such transfer.  If the Servicer fails to undertake such action as is reasonably necessary to effectuate such a transfer, the Indenture Trustee is hereby authorized and empowered to execute and deliver, on behalf of and at the expense of the Servicer, as attorney-in-fact or otherwise, any and all documents and other instruments, and to do or accomplish all other acts or things reasonably necessary to effect the purposes of such notice of termination.  The Servicer agrees that if it is terminated pursuant to this Section 5.4, it shall promptly (and, in any event, no later than five Business Days subsequent to its receipt of the notice of termination from the Indenture Trustee) provide the Indenture Trustee, the Backup Servicer or their respective designees (with reasonable costs being borne by the Servicer) with all documents and records (including, without limitation, those in electronic form) reasonably requested by it to enable the Indenture Trustee to assume the Servicer's functions hereunder and for the Backup Servicer to assume the functions required by the Backup Servicing Agreement, and the Servicer shall cooperate with the Indenture Trustee in effecting the termination of the Servicer's responsibilities and rights hereunder and the assumption by a successor of the Servicer's obligations hereunder, including, without limitation, the transfer within one Business Day to the Indenture Trustee or its designee for administration by it of all cash amounts which shall at the time or thereafter received by it with respect to the Timeshare Loans (provided,  however, that the Servicer shall continue to be entitled to receive all amounts accrued or owing to it under this Indenture on or prior to the date of such termination).  The Indenture Trustee shall be entitled to renegotiate the Servicing Fee; provided,  however, no change to the Servicing Fee may be made unless the Indenture Trustee shall have received the written consent of Noteholders representing at least 66-2/3% of the Adjusted Note Balance of each Class of Notes.  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in no event shall the Indenture Trustee or Bluegreen be liable for any Servicing Fee or for any differential in the amount of the Servicing Fee paid hereunder and the amount necessary to induce any successor Servicer to assume the obligations of Servicer under this Indenture.
		 			The Indenture Trustee shall be entitled to be reimbursed by the Servicer, (or by the Trust Estate to the extent set forth in Section 3.4(a)(i) or Section 6.6(a)(i) hereof) if the Servicer is unable to fulfill its obligations hereunder for all Servicer Termination Costs.		
		 			The successor Servicer shall have (i) no liability with respect to any obligation which was required to be performed by the terminated Servicer prior to the date that the successor Servicer becomes the Servicer or any claim of a third party based on any alleged action or inaction of the terminated Servicer, (ii) no obligation to perform any repurchase obligations, if any, of the Servicer, (iii) no obligation to pay any taxes required to be paid by the Servicer, (iv) no obligation to pay any of the fees and expenses of any other party involved in this transaction 		
				 			 		
		 that were incurred by the prior Servicer and (v) no liability or obligation with respect to any Servicer indemnification obligations of any prior Servicer including the original Servicer.		
		 			Notwithstanding anything contained in this Indenture to the contrary, any successor Servicer is authorized to accept and rely on all of the accounting, records (including computer records) and work of the prior Servicer relating to the Timeshare Loans (collectively, the "Predecessor Servicer Work Product";), without any audit or other examination thereof, and such successor Servicer shall have no duty, responsibility, obligation or liability for the acts and omissions of the prior Servicer.  If any error, inaccuracy, omission or incorrect or non-standard practice or procedure (collectively, "Errors";) exist in any Predecessor Servicer Work Product and such Errors make it materially more difficult to service or should cause or materially contribute to the successor Servicer making or continuing any Errors (collectively, "Continued Errors";), the successor Servicer shall have no duty, responsibility, obligation or liability for such Continued Errors; provided, however, that each successor Servicer shall agree to use its best efforts to prevent further Continued Errors.  In the event that the successor Servicer becomes aware of Errors or Continued Errors, the successor Servicer shall, with the prior consent of the Indenture Trustee, use its best efforts to reconstruct and reconcile such data as is commercially reasonable to correct such Errors and Continued Errors and to prevent future Continued Errors and to recover its costs thereby.		
		 			The Indenture Trustee may appoint an Affiliate or the Backup Servicer as the successor Servicer and the provisions of this Section 5.4(b) related to the Indenture Trustee shall apply to such Affiliate or Backup Servicer.		
		    			 				 (c) 			Any successor Servicer, including the Indenture Trustee, shall not be deemed to be in default or to have breached its duties as successor Servicer hereunder if the predecessor Servicer shall fail to deliver any required deposit into the Collection Account or otherwise fail to cooperate with, or take any actions required by such successor Servicer related to the transfer of servicing hereunder.
		    			 				 (d) 			Any successor Servicer appointed pursuant to this Indenture (i) as a condition to any such appointment (other than the Indenture Trustee), shall be a nationally recognized and licensed servicer of timeshare loan receivables that (A) is actively servicing a portfolio of timeshare loans with an aggregate principal balance of not less than $200,000,000, (B) has servicing and collection capabilities for all categories of delinquent and defaulted timeshare loans (including through foreclosure) and (C) is not an Affiliate of any Noteholder, and (ii) shall be subject to all of the terms and conditions of the Servicer under this Indenture (other than such terms and conditions as are unique to the initial Servicer), including, without limitation, the requirement to adhere to the Servicing Standard in the performance of the services to be furnished by it under this Indenture.
		    			 				 SECTION 5.5. 			Accountings; Statements and Reports.
		    			 				 (a) 			Monthly Servicer Report.  Not later than two Business Days prior to the Payment Date, the Servicer shall deliver to the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee, each Rating Agency and the Initial Purchasers, a report (the "Monthly Servicer Report";) substantially in the form of Exhibit H hereto, detailing certain activity relating to the Timeshare Loans.  The Monthly 				    		 			41				 			 		
		 Servicer Report shall be completed with the information specified therein for the related Due Period and shall contain such other information as may be reasonably requested by the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee or the Initial Purchasers in writing at least five Business Days prior to such Determination Date.  Each such Monthly Servicer Report shall be accompanied by an Officer's Certificate of the Servicer in the form of Exhibit I hereto, certifying the accuracy of the computations reflected in such Monthly Servicer Report.
		    			 				 (b) 			Certification as to Compliance. The Servicer shall deliver to the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee, each Rating Agency and the Initial Purchasers, an Officer's Certificate on or before June 30 of each year commencing in 2016: (x) to the effect that a review of the activities of the Servicer during the preceding calendar year, and of its performance under this Indenture during such period has been made under the supervision of the officer executing such Officer's Certificate with a view to determining whether during such period, to the best of such officer's knowledge, the Servicer had performed and observed all of its obligations under this Indenture, and (y) either (A) stating that based on such review, no Servicer Event of Default is known to have occurred and is continuing, or (B) if such a Servicer Event of Default is known to have occurred and is continuing, specifying such Servicer Event of Default and the nature and status thereof.
		    			 				 (c) 			Annual Accountants' Reports.  On or before each June 30 of each year commencing in 2016, the Servicer shall, at its own expense, (i) cause a firm of independent public accountants to furnish a certificate or statement (and the Servicer shall provide a copy of such certificate or statement to the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee, each Rating Agency and the Initial Purchasers), to the effect that (1) such firm has examined and audited the Servicer's servicing controls and procedures for the previous calendar year and that such independent public accountants have examined certain documents and records (including computer records) and servicing procedures of the Servicer relating to the Timeshare Loans, (2) they have examined the most recent Monthly Servicer Report prepared by the Servicer and three other Monthly Servicer Reports chosen at random by such firm and compared such Monthly Servicer Reports with the information contained in such documents and records, (3) their examination included such tests and procedures as they considered necessary in the circumstances, (4) their examinations and comparisons described under clauses (1) and (2) above disclosed no exceptions which, in their opinion, were material, relating to such Timeshare Loans or such Monthly Servicer Reports, or, if any such exceptions were disclosed thereby, setting forth such exceptions which, in their opinion, were material and (5) on the basis of such examinations and comparisons, such firm is of the opinion that the Servicer has, during the relevant period, serviced the Timeshare Loans in compliance with this Indenture and the other Transaction Documents in all material respects and that such documents and records have been maintained in accordance with this Indenture and the other Transaction Documents in all material respects, except in each case for (A) such exceptions as such firm shall believe to be immaterial and (B) such other exceptions as shall be set forth in such written report. The report will also indicate that such firm is independent of the Servicer within the meaning of the Code of Professional Ethics of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants.  In the event such independent public accountants require the Indenture Trustee to agree to the procedures to be performed by such firm in any of the reports required to be prepared pursuant to this Section 5.5(c), the Servicer shall direct the Indenture Trustee in writing to so agree; it being understood and agreed that the Indenture Trustee will deliver such letter of agreement in conclusive reliance upon the direction 				    		 			42				 			 		
		 of the Servicer, and the Indenture Trustee has not made any independent inquiry or investigation as to, and shall have no obligation or liability in respect of, the sufficiency, validity or correctness of such procedures.
		    			 				 (d) 			Report on Proceedings and Servicer Event of Default. (i) Promptly upon a Responsible Officer of the Servicer's obtaining Knowledge of any proposed or pending investigation of it by any Governmental Authority or any court or administrative proceeding which involves or is reasonably likely to have a material and adverse effect affecting the properties, business, prospects, profits or conditions (financial or otherwise) of the Servicer and its subsidiaries, as a whole, the Servicer shall send written notice specifying the nature of such investigation or proceeding and what action the Servicer is taking or proposes to take with respect thereto and evaluating its merits, or (ii) immediately upon obtaining Knowledge of the existence of any condition or event which constitutes a Servicer Event of Default, the Servicer shall send written notice to the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee and the Initial Purchasers describing its nature and period of existence and what action the Servicer is taking or proposes to take with respect thereto.  The Issuer, the Indenture Trustee and the Initial Purchasers acknowledge that if any condition or event referred to in subparagraph (i) above has been disclosed on a timely basis in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission relating to the Servicer, that such disclosure will satisfy the requirements of subparagraph (i) above.
		    			 				 SECTION 5.6. 			Records.
		 			The Servicer shall maintain all data for which it is responsible (including, without limitation, computerized tapes or disks) relating directly to or maintained in connection with the servicing of the Timeshare Loans (which data and records shall be clearly marked to reflect that the Timeshare Loans have been Granted to the Indenture Trustee on behalf of the Noteholders and constitute part of the Trust Estate) at the address specified in Section 13.3 hereof or, upon 15 days' notice to the Issuer and the Indenture Trustee, at such other place where any Servicing Officer of the Servicer is located (or upon 24 hours' written notice if an Event of Default or Servicer Event of Default shall have occurred).		
		    			 				 SECTION 5.7. 			Fidelity Bond and Errors and Omissions Insurance.
		 			The Servicer shall maintain or cause to be maintained fidelity bond and errors and omissions insurance with respect to the Servicer in such form and in amounts as is customary for institutions acting as custodian of funds in respect of timeshare loans or receivables on behalf of institutional investors; provided that such insurance shall be in a minimum amount of $1,000,000 per policy and shall name the Indenture Trustee as a certificate holder.  No provision of this Section 5.7 requiring such fidelity bond and errors and omissions insurance shall diminish or relieve the Servicer from its duties and obligations as set forth in this Indenture.  The Servicer shall be deemed to have complied with this provision if one of its respective Affiliates has such fidelity bond and errors and omissions insurance coverage and, by the terms of such fidelity bond and errors and omissions insurance policy, the coverage afforded thereunder extends to the Servicer.  Upon a request of the Indenture Trustee, the Servicer shall deliver to the Indenture Trustee, a certification evidencing coverage under such fidelity bond and the errors and omissions insurance.  Any such fidelity bond and errors and omissions insurance policy shall not be canceled or modified in a materially adverse manner without ten Business Days' prior written 		
				 			 		
		 notice to the Indenture Trustee, provided, that the Servicer agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to require the applicable insurer to provide ten days' prior written notice of any cancellation or modification initiated by such insurer.		
		    			 				 SECTION 5.8. 			Merger or Consolidation of the Servicer.
		    			 				 (a) 			The Servicer shall promptly provide written notice to the Indenture Trustee and each Rating Agency of any merger or consolidation of the Servicer.  The Servicer shall keep in full effect its existence, rights and franchise as a corporation under the laws of the state of its incorporation except as permitted herein, and shall obtain and preserve its qualification to do business as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction in which such qualification is or shall be necessary to protect the validity and enforceability of this Indenture or any of the Timeshare Loans and to perform its duties under this Indenture.
		    			 				 (b) 			Any Person into which the Servicer may be merged or consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which the Servicer shall be a party, or any Person succeeding to the business of the Servicer, shall be the successor of the Servicer hereunder, without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of any of the parties hereto, anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding; provided,  however, that the successor or surviving Person (i) is a company whose business includes the servicing of assets similar to the Timeshare Loans and shall be authorized to lawfully transact business in the state or states in which the related Timeshare Properties it is to service are situated; (ii) is a UxxPDSxxPD Person, and (iii) delivers to the Indenture Trustee (A) an agreement, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Indenture Trustee, which contains an assumption by such successor entity of the due and punctual performance and observance of each covenant and condition to be performed or observed by the Servicer under this Indenture and the other Transaction Documents to which the Servicer is a party and (B) an Opinion of Counsel as to the enforceability of such agreement.  The Servicer shall provide prior written notice of such merger or consolidation to each Rating Agency.
		    			 				 SECTION 5.9. 			Sub-Servicing.
		    			 				 (a) 			The Servicer may enter into one or more sub-servicing agreements with a sub-servicer upon delivery to the Indenture Trustee of a written confirmation from each Rating Agency that the execution of such sub-servicing agreement and the retention of such sub-servicer would not result in the qualification, downgrade or withdrawal of any rating assigned to a Class of Notes.  References herein to actions taken or to be taken by the Servicer in servicing the Timeshare Loans include actions taken or to be taken by a sub-servicer on behalf of the Servicer.  Any sub-servicing agreement will be upon such terms and conditions as the Servicer may reasonably agree and as are not inconsistent with this Indenture.  The Servicer shall be solely responsible for any sub-servicing fees due and payable to such sub-servicer.
		    			 				 (b) 			Notwithstanding any sub-servicing agreement, the Servicer shall remain obligated and liable for the servicing and administering of the Timeshare Loans in accordance with this Indenture, without diminution of such obligation or liability by virtue of such sub-servicing agreement, and to the same extent and under the same terms and conditions as if the Servicer alone were servicing and administering the Timeshare Loans.
				 			 		
		    			 				 SECTION 5.10. 			Servicer Resignation.
		 			The Servicer shall not resign from the duties and obligations hereby imposed on it under this Indenture unless and until (i) a successor servicer, acceptable to the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee and the Noteholders representing at least 66-2/3% of the Adjusted Note Balance of each Class of Notes, enters into an agreement in form and substance satisfactory to the Indenture Trustee and the Noteholders representing at least 66-2/3% of the Adjusted Note Balance of each Class of Notes, which contains an assumption by such successor servicer of the due and punctual performance and observance of each covenant and condition to be performed or observed by the Servicer under this Indenture from and after the date of assumption, (ii) the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee and Noteholders representing at least 66-2/3% of the Adjusted Note Balance of each Class of Notes consent to the assumption of the duties, obligations and liabilities of this Indenture by such successor Servicer, and (iii) the ratings of the Notes will not be qualified, downgraded or withdrawn (as evidenced by a letter from each Rating Agency to the Indenture Trustee to such effect, which letter shall be obtained at the expense of the Servicer, without right of reimbursement).  Upon such resignation, the Servicer shall comply with Section 5.4(b) hereof. 		
		 			Except as provided in the immediately preceding paragraph or elsewhere in this Indenture, or as provided with respect to the survival of indemnifications herein, the duties and obligations of a Servicer under this Indenture shall continue until this Indenture shall have been terminated as provided herein.  The duties and obligations of a Servicer hereunder shall survive the exercise by the Indenture Trustee of any right or remedy under this Indenture or the enforcement by the Indenture Trustee of any provision of this Indenture.		
		    			 				 SECTION 5.11. 			Fees and Expenses.
		 			As compensation for the performance of its obligations under this Indenture, the Servicer shall be entitled to receive on each Payment Date, from amounts on deposit in the Collection Account and in the priorities described in Sections 3.4 and 6.6 hereof, the Servicing Fee and any Additional Servicing Compensation.  Other than Liquidation Expenses, the Servicer shall pay all expenses incurred by it in connection with its servicing activities hereunder.   		
		    			 				 SECTION 5.12. 			Access to Certain Documentation.
		 			Upon ten Business Days' prior written notice (or, one Business Day's prior written notice after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default or a Servicer Event of Default), the Servicer will, from time to time during regular business hours, as requested by the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee or any Noteholder and, prior to the occurrence of a Servicer Event of Default, at the expense of the Issuer or such Noteholder and upon the occurrence and continuance of a Servicer Event of Default, at the expense of the Servicer, permit the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee or any Noteholder or its agents or representatives (i) to examine and make copies of and abstracts from all books, records and documents (including, without limitation, computer tapes and disks) in the possession or under the control of the Servicer relating to the servicing of the Timeshare Loans serviced by it and (ii) to visit the offices and properties of the Servicer for the purpose of examining such materials described in clause (i) above, and to discuss matters relating to the Timeshare Loans with any of the officers, 		
				 			 		
		 employees or accountants of the Servicer having knowledge of such matters.  Nothing in this Section 5.12 shall affect the obligation of the Servicer to observe any applicable law prohibiting disclosure of information regarding the Obligors, and the failure of the Servicer to provide access to information as a result of such obligation shall not constitute a breach of this Section 5.12.  The Servicer may require the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee or any Noteholder or its agents or representatives to execute certain agreements in order to comply with applicable privacy laws.		
		    			 				 SECTION 5.13. 			No Offset.
		 			Prior to the termination of this Indenture, the obligations of the Servicer under this Indenture shall not be subject to any defense, counterclaim or right of offset which the Servicer has or may have against the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee or any Noteholder, whether in respect of this Indenture, any Timeshare Loan or otherwise.		
		    			 				 SECTION 5.14. 			Account Statements.
		 			In connection with the Servicer's preparation of the Monthly Servicer Reports, the Indenture Trustee agrees to deliver to the Servicer a monthly statement providing account balances of each of the Trust Accounts.		
		    			 				 SECTION 5.15. 			Indemnification; Third Party Claim.
		 			The Servicer agrees to indemnify the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee and the Noteholders from and against any and all actual damages (excluding economic losses related to the collectibility of any Timeshare Loan), claims, reasonable attorneys' fees and related costs, judgments, and any other costs, fees and expenses that each may sustain because of the failure of the Servicer to service the Timeshare Loans in accordance with the Servicing Standard or otherwise perform its obligations and duties hereunder in compliance with the terms of this Indenture, or because of any act or omission by the Servicer due to its negligence or willful misconduct in connection with its maintenance and custody of any funds, documents and records under this Indenture, or its release thereof except as contemplated by this Indenture.  The Servicer shall immediately notify the Issuer and the Indenture Trustee if it has Knowledge of a claim made by a third party with respect to the Timeshare Loans, and, if such claim relates to the servicing of the Timeshare Loans by the Servicer, the Servicer shall assume, with the consent of the Indenture Trustee, the defense of any such claim and pay all expenses in connection therewith, including reasonable counsel fees, and promptly pay, discharge and satisfy any judgment or decree which may be entered against it.

It is further understood and intended that so long as any portion of the Notes remains Outstanding, the Servicer shall not have any right to institute any proceeding, judicial or otherwise, with respect to this Indenture (other than for the enforcement of Section 3.4 hereof) or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee (including without limitation a proceeding under the Bankruptcy Code), or for any other remedy hereunder.  Nothing in this Section 6.7 shall be construed as limiting the rights of otherwise qualified Noteholders to petition a court for the removal of an Indenture Trustee pursuant to Section 7.8 hereof.		
		    			 				 SECTION 6.8. 			Unconditional Right of Noteholders to Receive Principal and Interest.
		 			Notwithstanding any other provision in this Indenture, other than the provisions hereof limiting the right to recover amounts due on the Notes to recoveries from the property comprising the Trust Estate, each Noteholder shall have the absolute and unconditional right to receive payment of the principal of, and interest on, such Note as such payments of principal and interest become due, including on the Stated Maturity, and such right shall not be impaired without the consent of such Noteholder; provided, however, that notwithstanding any other provision of this Indenture to the contrary, the obligation to pay principal and interest on the Notes or any other amount payable to any Noteholder will be without recourse to the Originators, the Administrator, the Servicer, the Backup Servicer, the Indenture Trustee or any Affiliate (other than the Issuer), officer employee or director of any of them, and the obligation of the Issuer to pay principal of or interest on the Notes or any other amount payable to any Noteholder will be subject to the allocation and payment provisions of this Indenture and limited to amounts available from the Trust Estate.  Notwithstanding any other terms of this Indenture, the Notes, any Transaction Documents or otherwise, the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes, this Indenture and each other Transaction Document to which it is a party are limited recourse obligations of the Issuer, payable solely from the Trust Estate, and following realization of the Trust Estate and application of the proceeds thereof in accordance with the terms of this Indenture, none of the Noteholders, the Indenture Trustee or any of the other parties to the Transaction Documents shall be entitled to take any further steps to recover any sums due but still unpaid hereunder or thereunder, all claims in respect of which shall be extinguished and shall not thereafter revive.  It is understood that the foregoing provisions of this paragraph shall not (i) prevent recourse to the Trust Estate for sums due or to become due under any security, instrument or agreement which is part of the Trust Estate, (ii) save as specifically provided therein, constitute a waiver, release or discharge of any indebtedness or obligation evidenced by the Notes or secured by this Indenture.  It is further understood that the foregoing provisions of this paragraph shall not limit the right of any Person, to name the Issuer as a party defendant in any proceeding or in the exercise of any other remedy under the Notes or this Indenture, so long 		
				 			 		
		 as no judgment in the nature of a deficiency judgment or seeking personal liability shall be asked for or (if obtained) enforced against the Issuer.		
		    			 				 SECTION 6.9. 			Restoration of Rights and Remedies.
		 			If the Indenture Trustee or any Noteholder has instituted any proceeding to enforce any right or remedy under this Indenture and such proceeding has been discontinued or abandoned for any reason, or has been determined adversely to the Indenture Trustee or to such Noteholder, then and, in every such case, subject to any determination in such proceeding, the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee and the Noteholders shall be restored severally and respectively to their former positions hereunder and thereafter all rights and remedies of the Indenture Trustee and the Noteholders continue as though no such proceeding had been instituted.		
		    			 				 SECTION 6.10. 			Rights and Remedies Cumulative.
		 			Except as otherwise provided with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost, or stolen Notes in Section 2.5(f) hereof, no right or remedy herein conferred upon or reserved to the Indenture Trustee or to the Noteholders is intended to be exclusive of any other right or remedy, and every right and remedy shall, to the extent permitted by law, be cumulative and in addition to every other right and remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or otherwise.  The assertion or employment of any right or remedy hereunder, or otherwise, shall not prevent the concurrent assertion or employment of any other appropriate right or remedy.		
		    			 				 SECTION 6.11. 			Delay or Omission Not Waiver.
		 			No delay or omission of the Indenture Trustee or of any Noteholder to exercise any right or remedy accruing upon any Event of Default shall impair any such right or remedy or constitute a waiver of any such Event of Default or an acquiescence therein.  Every right and remedy given by this Article VI or by law to the Indenture Trustee or to the Noteholders may be exercised from time to time, and as often as may be deemed expedient, by the Indenture Trustee or by the Noteholders, as the case may be.		
		    			 				 SECTION 6.12. 			Control by Noteholders.
		 			Except as may otherwise be provided in this Indenture, until such time as the conditions specified in Sections 11.1(a)(i) and (ii) hereof have been satisfied in full, the Noteholders representing at least 66-2/3% of the Adjusted Note Balance of each Class of Notes shall have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Indenture Trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred on the Indenture Trustee, with respect to the Notes.  Notwithstanding the foregoing: 		
		    			 				 (i)			no such direction shall be in conflict with any rule of law or with this Indenture;
		    			 				 (ii)			the Indenture Trustee shall not be required to follow any such direction which the Indenture Trustee reasonably believes might result in any 				    		 			57				 			 		
		 personal liability on the part of the Indenture Trustee for which the Indenture Trustee is not adequately indemnified; and
		    			 				 (iii)			the Indenture Trustee may take any other action deemed proper by the Indenture Trustee which is not inconsistent with any such direction; provided that the Indenture Trustee shall give notice of any such action to each Noteholder.
		    			 				 SECTION 6.13. 			Waiver of Events of Default.
		    			 				 (a) 			Unless a Sequential Pay Event shall have occurred, the Noteholders representing at least 66-2/3% of the Adjusted Note Balance of each Class of Notes may, by one or more instruments in writing, waive any Event of Default hereunder and its consequences, except a continuing Event of Default:
		    			 				 (i)			in respect of the payment of the principal of or interest on any Note (which may only be waived by such Noteholder), or
		    			 				 (ii)			in respect of a covenant or provision hereof which under Article IX hereof cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the Noteholder of each Outstanding Note affected (which only may be waived by the Noteholders of all Outstanding Notes affected).
		    			 				 (b) 			A copy of each waiver pursuant to Section 6.13(a) hereof shall be furnished by the Issuer to the Indenture Trustee and each Noteholder.  Upon any such waiver, such Event of Default shall cease to exist and shall be deemed to have been cured, for every purpose of this Indenture; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Event of Default or impair any right consequent thereon.
		    			 				 SECTION 6.14. 			Undertaking for Costs.
		 			All parties to this Indenture agree (and each Noteholder by its acceptance thereof shall be deemed to have agreed) that any court may in its discretion require, in any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under this Indenture, or in any suit against the Indenture Trustee for any action taken, suffered or omitted by it as Indenture Trustee, the filing by any party litigant in such suit of an undertaking to pay the costs of such suit, and that such court may in its discretion assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees, against any party litigant in such suit, having due regard to the merits and good faith of the claims or defenses made by such party litigant; but the provisions of this Section 6.14 shall not apply to (i) any suit instituted by the Indenture Trustee, (ii) to any suit instituted by any Noteholder, or group of Noteholders representing at least 66-2/3% of the Adjusted Note Balance of each Class of Notes Outstanding, or (iii) to any suit instituted by any Noteholder for the enforcement of the payment of the principal of or interest on any Note on or after the maturities for such payments, including the Stated Maturity, as applicable. 		
		    			 				 SECTION 6.15. 			Waiver of Stay or Extension Laws.
		 			The Issuer covenants (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) that it will not at any time insist upon, or plead, or in any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit or 		
				 			 		
		 advantage of, any stay or extension law wherever enacted, now or at any time hereafter in force, which may affect the covenants or the performance of this Indenture; and the Issuer (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) hereby expressly waives all benefit or advantage of any such law and covenants that it will not hinder, delay or impede the execution of any power herein granted to the Indenture Trustee, but will suffer and permit the execution of every such power as though no such law had been enacted.		
		    			 				 SECTION 6.16. 			Sale of Trust Estate.
		    			 				 (a) 			The power to effect the sale of the Trust Estate pursuant to Section 6.3 hereof shall continue unimpaired until the entire Trust Estate shall have been sold or all amounts payable on the Notes shall have been paid or losses allocated thereto and borne thereby.  The Indenture Trustee may from time to time, upon directions in accordance with Section 6.12 hereof, postpone any public sale by public announcement made at the time and place of such sale.
		    			 				 (b) 			Unless required by applicable law, the Indenture Trustee shall not sell to a third party the Trust Estate, or any portion thereof except as permitted under Section 6.3(e) hereof.
		    			 				 (c) 			In connection with a sale of the Trust Estate:
		    			 				 (i)			 any one or more Noteholders (other than Bluegreen or any Affiliates thereof) may bid for and purchase the property offered for sale, and upon compliance with the terms of sale may hold, retain, and possess and dispose of such property, without further accountability, and any Noteholder (other than Bluegreen or any Affiliates thereof) may, in paying the purchase money therefor, deliver in lieu of cash any Outstanding Notes or claims for interest thereon for credit in the amount that shall, upon distribution of the net proceeds of such sale, be payable thereon, and the Notes, in case the amounts so payable thereon shall be less than the amount due thereon, shall be returned to the Noteholders after being appropriately stamped to show such partial payment;
		    			 				 (ii)			the Indenture Trustee shall execute and deliver an appropriate instrument of conveyance prepared by the Servicer transferring the Indenture Trustee's interest in the Trust Estate without recourse, representation or warranty in any portion of the Trust Estate in connection with a sale thereof;
		    			 				 (iii)			the Indenture Trustee is hereby irrevocably appointed the agent and attorney-in-fact of the Issuer to transfer and convey the Issuer's interest in any portion of the Trust Estate in connection with a sale thereof, and to take all action necessary to effect such sale;
		    			 				 (iv)			no purchaser or transferee at such a sale shall be bound to ascertain the Indenture Trustee's authority, inquire into the satisfaction of any conditions precedent or see to the application of any moneys;
				 			 		
		    			 				 (v)			the method, manner, time, place and terms of any sale of the Trust Estate shall be commercially reasonable; and
		    			 				 (vi)			none of Bluegreen or its Affiliates may bid for and purchase the Timeshare Loans offered for sale by the Indenture Trustee in Section 6.16(c)(i) hereof.
		    			 				 SECTION 6.17. 			Action on Notes.
		 			The Indenture Trustee's right to seek and recover judgment on the Notes or under this Indenture or any other Transaction Document shall not be affected by the seeking, obtaining or application of any other relief under or with respect to this Indenture or any other Transaction Document.  Neither the Lien of this Indenture nor any rights or remedies of the Indenture Trustee or the Noteholders shall be impaired by the recovery of any judgment by the Indenture Trustee against the Issuer or by the levy of any execution under such judgment upon any portion of the Trust Estate or upon any of the assets of the Issuer.  Any money or property collected by the Indenture Trustee shall be applied in accordance with the provisions of this Indenture.		
		    			 				 SECTION 6.18. 			Performance and Enforcement of Certain Obligations.
		 			Promptly following a request from the Indenture Trustee, the Issuer shall take all such lawful action as the Indenture Trustee may request to compel or secure the performance and observance by the Depositor, the Club Originator and the Servicer, as applicable, of each of their respective obligations to the Issuer under or in connection with the Sale Agreement and any other Transaction Document and to exercise any and all rights, remedies, powers and privileges lawfully available to the Issuer under or in connection with the Sale Agreement or any other Transaction Document to the extent and in the manner directed by the Indenture Trustee, including the transmission of notices of default on the part of the Depositor, the Club Originator or the Servicer thereunder and the institution of legal or administrative actions or proceedings to compel or secure performance by the Depositor, the Club Originator or the Servicer of each of their obligations under the Sale Agreement and the other Transaction Documents.

		    			 				 SECTION 7.1. 			Certain Duties.
		    			 				 (a) 			The Indenture Trustee undertakes to perform such duties and only such duties as are specifically set forth in this Indenture, and no implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this Indenture against the Indenture Trustee; except as expressly set forth herein, the Indenture Trustee shall have no obligation to monitor the performance of the Servicer under the Transaction Documents.
		    			 				 (b) 			In the absence of bad faith on its part, the Indenture Trustee may conclusively rely, as to the truth of the statements and the correctness of the opinions expressed therein, upon certificates or opinions furnished to the Indenture Trustee and conforming to the requirements of this Indenture; but in the case of any such certificates or opinions which by any 				    		 			60				 			 		
		 provision hereof are specifically required to be furnished to the Indenture Trustee, the Indenture Trustee shall be under a duty to examine the same to determine whether or not they conform to the requirements of this Indenture; provided,  however, the Indenture Trustee shall not be required to verify or recalculate the contents thereof.
		    			 				 (c) 			In case an Event of Default or a Servicer Event of Default (resulting in the appointment of the Indenture Trustee as successor Servicer) has occurred and is continuing, the Indenture Trustee shall exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it by this Indenture, and use the same degree of care and skill in their exercise, as a prudent Person would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of such Person's own affairs; provided,  however, that no provision in this Indenture shall be construed to limit the obligations of the Indenture Trustee to provide notices under Section 7.2 hereof.
		    			 				 (d) 			The Indenture Trustee shall be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers vested in it by this Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Noteholders pursuant to this Indenture, unless such Noteholders shall have offered to the Indenture Trustee reasonable security or indemnity acceptable to the Indenture Trustee (which may be in the form of written assurances) against the costs, expenses and liabilities which might be incurred by it in compliance with such request or direction.
		    			 				 (e) 			No provision of this Indenture shall be construed to relieve the Indenture Trustee from liability for its own negligent action, its own negligent failure to act, or its own willful misconduct, except that:
		    			 				 (i)			this Section 7.1(e) shall not be construed to limit the effect of Section 7.1(a) and (b) hereof;
		    			 				 (ii)			the Indenture Trustee shall not be liable for any error of judgment made in good faith by a Responsible Officer unless it shall be proved that the Indenture Trustee shall have been negligent in ascertaining the pertinent facts; and
		    			 				 (iii)			the Indenture Trustee shall not be liable with respect to any action taken or omitted to be taken by it in good faith in accordance with the written direction of the holders of the requisite principal amount of the outstanding Notes, or in accordance with any written direction delivered to it under Sections 6.2(a), (b) or (c) hereof relating to the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Indenture Trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred upon the Indenture Trustee, under this Indenture.
		    			 				 (f) 			Whether or not therein expressly so provided, every provision of this Indenture relating to the conduct or affecting the liability of or affording protection to the Indenture Trustee shall be subject to the provisions of this Section 7.1.
		    			 				 (g) 			The Indenture Trustee makes no representations or warranties with respect to the Timeshare Loans or the Notes or the validity or sufficiency of any assignment of the Timeshare Loans to the Issuer or to the Trust Estate.
				 			 		
		    			 				 (h) 			Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Indenture Trustee is not required to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur financial liability in the performance of any of its duties hereunder or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers, if it shall have reasonable grounds to believe that repayment of such funds or adequate indemnity against such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to it.
		    			 				 SECTION 7.2. 			Notice of Events of Default.
		 			The Indenture Trustee shall promptly (but, in any event, within three Business Days) notify the Issuer, the Servicer, each Rating Agency and the Noteholders upon a Responsible Officer obtaining actual knowledge of any event which constitutes an Event of Default or a Servicer Event of Default or would constitute an Event of Default or a Servicer Event of Default but for the requirement that notice be given or time elapse or both.		
		    			 				 SECTION 7.3. 			Certain Matters Affecting the Indenture Trustee.
		 			Subject to the provisions of Section 7.1 hereof:		
		    			 				 (a) 			The Indenture Trustee may rely and shall be protected in acting or refraining from acting upon any resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, direction, consent, order, bond, debenture, note, other evidence of indebtedness or other paper or document believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties;
		    			 				 (b) 			Any request or direction of any Noteholders, the Issuer, or the Servicer mentioned herein shall be in writing;
		    			 				 (c) 			Whenever in the performance of its duties hereunder the Indenture Trustee shall deem it desirable that a matter be proved or established prior to taking, suffering or omitting any action hereunder, the Indenture Trustee (unless other evidence be herein specifically prescribed) may, in the absence of bad faith on its part, rely upon an Officer's Certificate or an Opinion of Counsel;
		    			 				 (d) 			The Indenture Trustee may consult with counsel, and the advice of such counsel or any Opinion of Counsel shall be deemed authorization in respect of any action taken, suffered, or omitted by it hereunder in good faith and in reliance thereon;
		    			 				 (e) 			Prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default or after the curing of all Events of Default which may have occurred, the Indenture Trustee shall not be bound to make any investigation into the facts or matters stated in any resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, consent, order, approval, bond or other paper document, unless requested in writing so to do by Noteholders representing at least 66-2/3% of the Adjusted Note Balance of each Class of Notes; provided,  however, that if the payment within a reasonable time to the Indenture Trustee of the costs, expenses or liabilities likely to be incurred by it in the making of such investigation is, in the reasonable opinion of the Indenture Trustee, not reasonably assured to the Indenture Trustee by the security afforded to it by the terms of this Indenture, the Indenture Trustee may require reasonable indemnity against such cost, expense or liability as a condition to so proceeding.  The reasonable expense of every such 				    		 			62				 			 		
		 examination shall be paid by the Servicer or, if paid by the Indenture Trustee, shall be reimbursed by the Servicer upon demand;
		    			 				 (f) 			The Indenture Trustee may execute any of the trusts or powers hereunder or perform any duties hereunder either directly or by or through agents or attorneys or a custodian (which may be an Affiliate of the Indenture Trustee), and the Indenture Trustee shall not be liable for any acts or omissions of such agents, attorneys or custodians appointed with due care by it hereunder; and
		    			 				 (g) 			Delivery of any reports, information and documents to the Indenture Trustee provided for herein or any other Transaction Document is for informational purposes only (unless otherwise expressly stated), and the Indenture Trustee's receipt of such shall not constitute constructive knowledge of any information contained therein or determinable from information contained therein, including the Servicer's or the Issuer's compliance with any of its representations, warranties or covenants hereunder (as to which the Indenture Trustee is entitled to rely exclusively on Officer's Certificates).
		    			 				 SECTION 7.4. 			Indenture Trustee Not Liable for Notes or Timeshare Loans.
		    			 				 (a) 			The Indenture Trustee makes no representations as to the validity or sufficiency of this Indenture or any Transaction Document, the Notes (other than the authentication thereof) or of any Timeshare Loan.

		    			 				 (b) 			The Indenture Trustee (in its capacity as Indenture Trustee) shall have no responsibility or liability for or with respect to the validity of any security interest in any property securing a Timeshare Loan; the existence or validity of any Timeshare Loan, the validity of the assignment of any Timeshare Loan to the Trust Estate or of any intervening assignment; the review of any Timeshare Loan, any Timeshare Loan File, the completeness of any Timeshare Loan File, the receipt by the Custodian of any Timeshare Loan, Timeshare Loan File, (it being understood that the Indenture Trustee has not reviewed and does not intend to review such matters); the performance or enforcement of any Timeshare Loan; the compliance by the Servicer or the Issuer with any covenant or the breach by the Servicer or the Issuer of any warranty or representation made hereunder or in any Transaction Document or the accuracy of any such warranty or representation; the acts or omissions of the Servicer, the Issuer or any Obligor; or any action of the Servicer or the Issuer taken in the name of the Indenture Trustee.
		    			 				 SECTION 7.5. 			Indenture Trustee May Own Notes.
		 			The Indenture Trustee in its individual or any other capacity may become the owner or pledgee of Notes with the same rights as it would have if it were not the Indenture Trustee. Any Paying Agent, Note Registrar, co-registrar or co-paying agent may become the owner or pledgee of Notes with the same rights as it would have if it were not the Paying Agent, Note Registrar, co-registrar or co-paying agent.		
				 			 		
		    			 				 SECTION 7.6. 			Indenture Trustee's Fees and Expenses.
		 			On each Payment Date, the Indenture Trustee shall be entitled to the Indenture Trustee Fee and reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses incurred by it in connection with its responsibilities hereunder in the priorities provided in Sections 3.4 or 6.6 hereof, as applicable.		
		    			 				 SECTION 7.7. 			Eligibility Requirements for Indenture Trustee.
		 			The Indenture Trustee, hereunder shall at all times (a) be a corporation, depository institution, national banking association or trust company organized and doing business under the laws of the United States of America or any state thereof authorized under such laws to exercise corporate trust powers, having a combined capital and surplus of at least $100,000,000, (b) be subject to supervision or examination by federal or state authority, (c) be capable of maintaining an Eligible Bank Account, (d) have a long-term unsecured debt rating of not less than "Baa2"; from Moody's and "BBB"; from S&P, and (e) shall be acceptable to Noteholders representing at least 66-2/3% of the Adjusted Note Balance of each Class of Notes.

In case at any time the Indenture Trustee shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section 7.7, the Indenture Trustee shall resign in the manner and with the effect specified in Section 7.8 hereof. 		
		    			 				 SECTION 7.8. 			Resignation or Removal of Indenture Trustee.
		    			 				 (a) 			The Indenture Trustee may at any time resign and be discharged with respect to the Notes by giving 60 days' written notice thereof to the Servicer, the Issuer, each Rating Agency and the Noteholders.  Upon receiving such notice of resignation, the Issuer shall promptly appoint a successor Indenture Trustee not objected to by Noteholders representing at least 66-2/3% of the Adjusted Note Balance of each Class of Notes within 30 days after prior written notice, by written instrument, in sextuplicate, one counterpart of which instrument shall be delivered to each of the Issuer, the Servicer, each Rating Agency, the Noteholders, the successor Indenture Trustee and the predecessor Indenture Trustee.  If no successor Indenture Trustee shall have been so appointed and have accepted appointment within 60 days after the giving of such notice of resignation, the resigning Indenture Trustee may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Indenture Trustee.
		    			 				 (b) 			If at any time the Indenture Trustee shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of Section 7.7 hereof and shall fail to resign after written request therefor by the Issuer, or if at any time the Indenture Trustee shall be legally unable to act, fails to perform in any material respect its obligations under this Indenture, or shall be adjudged as bankrupt or insolvent, or a receiver of the Indenture Trustee or of its property shall be appointed, or any public officer shall take charge or control of the Indenture Trustee or of its property or affairs for the purpose of rehabilitation, conservation or liquidation, then the Issuer or Noteholders representing at least 66-2/3% of the Adjusted Note Balance of each Class of Notes may direct the Issuer to remove the Indenture Trustee.  If it removes the Indenture Trustee under the authority 				    		 			64				 			 		
		 of the immediately preceding sentence, the Issuer shall promptly appoint a successor Indenture Trustee not objected to by Noteholders representing at least 66-2/3% of the Adjusted Note Balance of each Class of Notes, within 30 days after prior written notice, by written instrument, in sextuplicate, one counterpart of which instrument shall be delivered to each of the Issuer, the Servicer, the Noteholders, each Rating Agency, the successor Indenture Trustee and the predecessor Indenture Trustee.
		    			 				 (c) 			Any resignation or removal of the Indenture Trustee and appointment of a successor Indenture Trustee pursuant to any of the provisions of this Section 7.8 shall not become effective until acceptance of appointment by the successor Indenture Trustee as provided in Section 7.9 hereof.
		    			 				 SECTION 7.9. 			Successor Indenture Trustee.
		    			 				 (a) 			Any successor Indenture Trustee appointed as provided in Section 7.8 hereof shall execute, acknowledge and deliver to each of the Servicer, the Issuer, each Rating Agency, the Noteholders and to its predecessor Indenture Trustee an instrument accepting such appointment hereunder, and thereupon the resignation or removal of the predecessor Indenture Trustee shall become effective and such successor Indenture Trustee, without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become fully vested with all the rights, powers, duties and obligations of its predecessor Indenture Trustee hereunder with like effect as if originally named a Indenture Trustee.  The predecessor Indenture Trustee shall deliver or cause to be delivered to the successor Indenture Trustee or its custodian any Transaction Documents and statements held by it or its custodian hereunder; and the Servicer and the Issuer and the predecessor Indenture Trustee shall execute and deliver such instruments and do such other things as may reasonably be required for the full and certain vesting and confirmation in the successor Indenture Trustee of all such rights, powers, duties and obligations.
		    			 				 (b) 			In case of the appointment hereunder of a successor Indenture Trustee with respect to the Notes, the Issuer, the retiring Indenture Trustee and each successor Indenture Trustee with respect to the Notes shall execute and deliver an indenture supplemental hereto wherein each successor Indenture Trustee shall accept such appointment and which (i) shall contain such provisions as shall be necessary or desirable to transfer and confirm to, and to vest in, each successor Indenture Trustee all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Indenture Trustee with respect to the Notes to which the appointment of such successor Indenture Trustee relates, (ii) if the retiring Indenture Trustee is not retiring with respect to all Notes, shall contain such provisions as shall be deemed necessary or desirable to confirm that all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Indenture Trustee with respect to the Notes as to which the retiring Indenture Trustee is not retiring shall continue to be vested in the retiring Indenture Trustee, and (iii) shall add to or change any of the provisions of this Indenture as shall be necessary to provide for or facilitate the administration of the Trust Estate hereunder by more than one Indenture Trustee, it being understood that nothing herein or in such supplemental indenture shall constitute such Indenture Trustees co-trustees of the same allocated trust and that each such Indenture Trustee shall be trustee of a trust or trusts hereunder separate and apart from any trust or trusts hereunder administered by any other such Indenture Trustee; and upon the execution and delivery of such supplemental indenture the resignation or removal of the retiring Indenture Trustee shall become effective to the extent provided therein and each such successor 				    		 			65				 			 		
		 Indenture Trustee, without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Indenture Trustee with respect to the Notes to which the appointment of such successor Indenture Trustee relates; but, on request of the Issuer or any successor Indenture Trustee, such retiring Indenture Trustee shall duly assign, transfer and deliver to such successor Indenture Trustee all property and money held by such retiring Indenture Trustee hereunder with respect to the Notes of that or those to which the appointment of such successor Indenture Trustee relates.
		 			Upon request of any such successor Indenture Trustee, the Issuer shall execute any and all instruments for more fully and certainly vesting in and confirming to such successor indenture trustee all such rights, powers and trusts referred to in the preceding paragraph.		
		    			 				 (c) 			No successor Indenture Trustee shall accept appointment as provided in this Section 7.9 unless at the time of such acceptance such successor Indenture Trustee shall be eligible under the provisions of Section 7.7 hereof.
		    			 				 (d) 			Upon acceptance of appointment by a successor Indenture Trustee as provided in this Section 7.9, the Servicer shall mail notice of the succession of such Indenture Trustee hereunder to each Noteholder at its address as shown in the Note Register.  If the Servicer fails to mail such notice within ten days after acceptance of appointment by the successor Indenture Trustee, the successor Indenture Trustee shall cause such notice to be mailed at the expense of the Issuer and the Servicer.
		    			 				 SECTION 7.10. 			Merger or Consolidation of Indenture Trustee.
		 			Any Person into which the Indenture Trustee may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any Person resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which the Indenture Trustee shall be a party, or any Person succeeding to the corporate trust business of the Indenture Trustee, shall be the successor of the Indenture Trustee hereunder, provided such Person shall be eligible under the provisions of Section 7.7 hereof, without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of any of the parties hereto, anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding.		
		    			 				 SECTION 7.11. 			Appointment of Co-Indenture Trustee or Separate Indenture Trustee.
		    			 				 (a) 			At any time or times for the purpose of meeting any legal requirement of any jurisdiction in which any part of the Trust Estate may at the time be located or in which any action of the Indenture Trustee may be required to be performed or taken, the Indenture Trustee, the Servicer or the Noteholders representing at least 66-2/3% of the Adjusted Note Balance of each Class of Notes, by an instrument in writing signed by it or them, may appoint, at the reasonable expense of the Issuer and the Servicer, one or more Persons to act as separate trustee or separate trustees or co-trustee, acting jointly with the Indenture Trustee, of all or any part of the Trust Estate, to the full extent that local law makes it necessary for such separate trustee or separate trustees or co-trustee acting jointly with the Indenture Trustee to act.  Notwithstanding the appointment of any separate or co-trustee, the Indenture Trustee shall remain obligated and liable for the obligations of the Indenture Trustee under this Indenture.
				 			 		
		    			 				 (b) 			The Indenture Trustee and, at the request of the Indenture Trustee, the Issuer shall execute, acknowledge and deliver all such instruments as may be required by the legal requirements of any jurisdiction or by any such separate trustee or separate trustees or co-trustee for the purpose of more fully confirming such title, rights, or duties to such separate trustee or separate trustees or co-trustee.  Upon the acceptance in writing of such appointment by any such separate trustee or separate trustees or co-trustee, it, he, she or they shall be vested with such title to the Trust Estate or any part thereof, and with such rights, powers, duties and obligations as shall be specified in the instrument of appointment, and such rights, powers, duties and obligations shall be conferred or imposed upon and exercised or performed by the Indenture Trustee, or the Indenture Trustee and such separate trustee or separate trustees or co-trustees jointly with the Indenture Trustee subject to all the terms of this Indenture, except to the extent that under any law of any jurisdiction in which any particular act or acts are to be performed the Indenture Trustee shall be incompetent or unqualified to perform such act or acts, in which event such rights, powers, duties and obligations shall be exercised and performed by such separate trustee or separate trustees or co-trustee, as the case may be.  Any separate trustee or separate trustees or co-trustee may, at any time by an instrument in writing, constitute the Indenture Trustee its attorney-in-fact and agent with full power and authority to do all acts and things and to exercise all discretion on its behalf and in its name.  In any case, if any such separate trustee or co-trustee shall die, become incapable of acting, resign or be removed, the title to the Trust Estate and all assets, property, rights, power duties and obligations and duties of such separate trustee or co-trustee shall, so far as permitted by law, vest in and be exercised by the Indenture Trustee, without the appointment of a successor to such separate trustee or co-trustee unless and until a successor is appointed.
		    			 				 (c) 			All provisions of this Indenture which are for the benefit of the Indenture Trustee shall extend to and apply to each separate trustee or co-trustee appointed pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 7.11.

		 If at any time, the Indenture Trustee shall deem it no longer necessary or prudent in order to conform to such law, the Indenture Trustee shall execute and deliver all instruments and agreements necessary or proper to remove any additional trustee or separate trustee.		
		    			 				 (e) 			Any request, approval or consent in writing by the Indenture Trustee to any additional trustee or separate trustee shall be sufficient warrant to such additional trustee or separate trustee, as the case may be, to take such action as may be so requested, approved or consented to.
		    			 				 (f) 			Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 7.11, the powers of any additional trustee or separate trustee shall not exceed those of the Indenture Trustee hereunder.
		    			 				 SECTION 7.12. 			Paying Agent and Note Registrar Rights.
		 			So long as the Indenture Trustee is the Paying Agent and Note Registrar, the Paying Agent and Note Registrar shall be entitled to the rights, benefits and immunities of the Indenture Trustee as set forth in this Article VII to the same extent and as fully as though named in place of the Indenture Trustee herein.

		 			The Issuer hereby authorizes and directs the Indenture Trustee to enter into the Lockbox Agreement.  Pursuant to the Lockbox Agreement, the Indenture Trustee agrees to cause to be established and maintained an account (the "Lockbox Account";) for the benefit of the Noteholders.  The Lockbox Account will be titled as required by the Lockbox Bank.  The Indenture Trustee is authorized and directed to act as titleholder of the Lockbox Account in accordance with the terms of the Lockbox Agreement for the benefit of the Noteholders with interests in the funds on deposit in such account.  In addition, the Indenture Trustee is hereby authorized to enter into, execute, deliver and perform under, each of the applicable Transaction Documents and the Depository Agreement.  The Lockbox Bank will be required to transfer and will be permitted to withdraw funds from the Lockbox Account in accordance with the Lockbox Agreement.

		    			 				 (d) 			The Issuer shall not become an "investment company"; or under the "control"; of an "investment company"; as such terms are defined in the '40 Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder (taking into account not only the general definition of the term "investment company"; but also any available exceptions to such general definition); provided,  however, that the Issuer shall be in compliance with this Section 8.4 if it shall have obtained an order exempting it from regulation as an "investment company"; so long as it is in compliance with the conditions imposed in such order.

		 of the Indenture Trustee to monitor the compliance of the Issuer with the foregoing covenants, and provided,  further, that the duty of the Indenture Trustee or the Servicer to execute any instrument required pursuant to this Section 8.5 shall arise only if a Responsible Officer of the Indenture Trustee or the Servicer, as applicable, has Knowledge of any failure of the Issuer to comply with the provisions of this Section 8.5.

The execution, delivery and performance by the Backup Servicer of the Transaction Documents to which it is a party do not and will not (i) conflict with or violate the organizational documents of the Backup Servicer, (ii) conflict with or result in a breach of any of the terms, conditions or provisions of, or constitute a default under, or result in the creation of any Lien on any of the properties or assets of the Backup Servicer pursuant to the terms of any instrument or agreement to which the Backup Servicer is a party or by which it is bound where such conflict would have a material adverse effect on the Backup Servicer's activities or its ability to perform its obligations under the Transaction Documents or (iii) require any consent of or other action by any trustee or any creditor of, any lessor to or any investor in the Backup Servicer.
		    			 				 (h) 			Compliance with Law.  The Backup Servicer is in material compliance with all statutes, laws and ordinances and all governmental rules and regulations to which it is subject, the violation of which, either individually or in the aggregate, could materially adversely affect its business, earnings, properties or condition (financial or other).  The internal policies and procedures employed by the Backup Servicer are in material compliance with all applicable statutes, laws and ordinances and all governmental rules and regulations.  The execution, delivery and performance of the Transaction Documents to which it is a party do not and will not cause the Backup Servicer to be in violation of any law or ordinance, or any order, rule or regulation, of any federal, state, municipal or other governmental or public authority or agency where such violation would, either individually or in the aggregate, materially adversely affect its business, earnings, properties or condition (financial or other).
		    			 				 (i) 			Pending Litigation or Other Proceedings.  There is no pending or, to the best of the Backup Servicer's Knowledge, threatened action, suit, proceeding or investigation before any court, administrative agency, arbitrator or governmental body against or affecting the Backup Servicer which, if decided adversely, would materially and adversely affect (i) the condition (financial or otherwise), business or operations of the Backup Servicer, (ii) the ability of the Backup Servicer to perform its obligations under, or the validity or enforceability of this Indenture or any other documents or transactions contemplated under this Indenture, (iii) any property or title of any Obligor to any property or (iv) the Indenture Trustee's ability to foreclose or otherwise enforce the Liens of the Timeshare Loans.

The Backup Servicer is not in default under any material agreement, contract, instrument or indenture to which it is a party or by which it or its properties is or are bound, or with respect to any order of any court, administrative agency, arbitrator or governmental body, which default would have a material adverse effect on the transactions contemplated hereunder; and to the Backup Servicer's Knowledge, no event has occurred which with notice or lapse of time or both would constitute such a default with respect to any such agreement, contract, instrument or indenture, or with respect to any such order of any court, administrative agency, arbitrator or governmental body.
		    			 				 (o) 			Insolvency.  The Backup Servicer is solvent.  Prior to the date hereof, the Backup Servicer did not, and is not about to, engage in any business or transaction for which any property remaining with the Backup Servicer would constitute an unreasonably small amount of capital.

There are no facts relating to the Backup Servicer as of the Closing Date which when taken as a 				    		 			92				 			 		
		 whole, materially adversely affect the financial condition or assets or business of the Backup Servicer, or which may impair the ability of the Backup Servicer to perform its obligations under this Indenture or any other Transaction Document to which it is a party, which have not been disclosed herein or in the certificates and other documents furnished by or on behalf of the Backup Servicer pursuant hereto or thereto specifically for use in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.
