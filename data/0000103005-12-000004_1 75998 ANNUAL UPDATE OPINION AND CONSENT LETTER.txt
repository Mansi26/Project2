   Post-Effective Amendment No. 31 to Registration Statement on Form N-4



   Prospectus Title: Individual Nonqualified Variable Annuity Contracts



   File Nos.: 033-75998 and 811-02512



   Ladies and Gentlemen:



   The undersigned serves as counsel to ING Life Insurance and Annuity Company, a Connecticut



   life insurance company (the "Company"). It is my understanding that the Company, as depositor,



   has registered an indefinite amount of securities (the "Securities") under the Securities Act of



   1933 (the "Securities Act") as provided in Rule 24f-2 under the Investment Company Act of 1940



   (the "Investment Company Act").



   In connection with this opinion, I have reviewed the N-4 Registration, as amended to the date



   hereof, and this Post-Effective Amendment No. 31. I have also examined originals or copies,



   certified or otherwise identified to my satisfaction, of such documents, trust records and other



   instruments I have deemed necessary or appropriate for the purpose of rendering this opinion. For



   purposes of such examination, I have assumed the genuineness of all signatures on original



   documents and the conformity to the original of all copies.

I am admitted to practice law in Connecticut, and do not purport to be an expert on the laws of


	
any other state. My opinion herein as to any other law is based upon a limited inquiry thereof


	
which I have deemed appropriate under the circumstances.


	
Based upon the foregoing, and, assuming the Securities are sold in accordance with the provisions


	
of the prospectus, I am of the opinion that the Securities being registered will be legally issued


	
and will represent binding obligations of the Company.


	
I consent to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit to the Registration Statement.


	
Sincerely,


	
/s/ J. Neil McMurdie
