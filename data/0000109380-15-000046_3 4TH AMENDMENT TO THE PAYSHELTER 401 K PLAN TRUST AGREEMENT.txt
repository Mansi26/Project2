 EXHIBIT 10.25 FOURTH AMENDMENT TO TRUST AGREEMENT BETWEEN FIDELITY MANAGEMENT TRUST COMPANY AND ZIONS BANCORPORATION THIS FOURTH AMENDMENT, dated and effective as of the first day of October, 2014, by and between Fidelity Management Trust Company (the "Trustee") and Zions Bancorporation (the "Sponsor"); WITNESSETH: WHEREAS, the Trustee and the Sponsor heretofore entered into a Trust Agreement dated July 3, 2006, with regard to the Zions Bancorporation Payshelter 401(k) and Employee Stock Ownership Plan (the "Plan"); and WHEREAS, the Trustee and the Sponsor now desire to amend said Trust Agreement as provided for in Section 13 thereof; NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the above premises, the Trustee and the Sponsor hereby amend the Trust Agreement by: (1)   Restating Section 6(c), Inspection and Audit, in its entirety, as follows: (c)    Inspection and Audit The Trustee will provide to auditors (including third-party auditors and Sponsor's internal audit staff) as Sponsor may designate in writing, access to any Trustee owned or managed facility at which the services are being performed, to appropriate Trustee management personnel, and to the data and records (and other documentation reasonably requested by the Sponsor) maintained by the Trustee with respect to the services solely for the purpose of examining (i) transactional books and records maintained by the Trustee in order to provide the services, (ii) documentation of service level performance, and (iii) invoices to the Sponsor. Any such audits will be conducted at the Sponsor's expense. The Sponsor and its auditors will first look to the most recent Service Organization Control I Report Type II ("Type II SOC"), formerly referred to as a Service Auditor's Report or SAS 70 Report, before conducting further audits. Type II SOC reports will be issued by the Trustee or its affiliate's independent public accounting firm in accordance with Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements No. 16 ("SSAE 16"), Reporting on Controls at a Service Organization, or superseding standards set forth by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. Excepting audit requests from governmental or regulatory agencies, if a matter is not covered in such Type II SOC, then the Sponsor will provide the Trustee not less than ninety (90) days prior written notice of an audit and will provide a proposed detailed scope and timeframe of the audit requested by the Sponsor to the Trustee in writing at least sixty (60) days prior to date of the audit. The Sponsor and its auditors will conduct such audits in a manner that will result in a minimum of inconvenience and disruption to the Trustee's operations. Audits may be conducted only during normal business hours and no more frequently than annually unless otherwise required as a matter of law or for compliance with regulatory or contractual requirements. Any audit assistance provided by the Trustee in excess of thirty-five audit hours per annum shall be provided on a fee-for-service basis. The Sponsor will reimburse the Trustee for any out of pocket expenses incurred by the Trustee in connection with an audit conducted pursuant to this section. The Sponsor and its auditors will not be entitled to review or audit (i) data or information of other customers or clients of the Trustee, (ii) any of Trustee's proprietary data, or (iii) any other Confidential Information of the Trustee that is not relevant for the purposes of the audit. The Sponsor and its auditors will not be entitled to logical access to the Trustee's networks and systems, nor unrestricted physical access to Trustee's facilities and personnel. Reviews of processes, controls, and support documentation will be facilitated with appropriate Trustee's personnel. The Trustee will use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate in the audit, will make available on a timely basis the information reasonably required to conduct the audit and will assist the designated employees of the Sponsor or its auditors as reasonably necessary. To the maximum extent possible, audits will be designed and conducted (in such manner and with such frequency) so as not to interfere with the provision of the services. The Sponsor will not use any competitors of the Trustee (or any significant subcontractor of Trustee under this Agreement) to conduct such audits. The auditors and other representatives of the Sponsor will execute and deliver such confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements and comply with such security and confidentiality requirements as the Trustee may reasonably request in connection with such audits. (2)   Amending Section 7, Compensation and Expenses, by replacing the first paragraph in its entirety with the following: Sponsor shall cause the Plan to pay or shall itself pay to Trustee, within thirty (30) days of receipt of the Trustee's bill, the fees for services in accordance with Schedule B. Fees for services are specifically outlined in Schedule B and are based on all of the assumptions identified therein. The Trustee shall maintain its fees for five years; provided, however, in the event the Plan characteristics referenced in the assumptions outlined in Schedule B change significantly by either falling below or exceeding current or projected levels, such fees may be subject to revision, upon mutual renegotiation. To reflect increased operating costs, Trustee may once each calendar year, but not prior to October 1, 2019, amend Schedule B without the Sponsor's consent upon one hundred eighty (180) days prior notice to the Sponsor. Any overcharge by the Trustee, or underpayment of fees or expenses by the Sponsor that is the result of a good-faith fee dispute, shall bear interest until paid by the appropriate party with such interest determined by calculating the average of the prime rates reported in the Wall Street Journal from the date of overpayment or underpayment until such corrective payment is made by the appropriate party. Any underpayment of fees or expenses by the Sponsor that is not the subject of a good-faith fee dispute shall bear interest until paid at the rate of the lesser of (i) 1&#189;% per month, or (ii) the maximum amount permitted by law. (3)   Amending to add a new Section 22, Use of Omnibus Accounts, as follows: Section 23.    Use of Omnibus Accounts. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, Sponsor understands, acknowledges and agrees that, (i) the Trustee utilizes omnibus accounts at unaffiliated banks to facilitate transactions for the defined contribution plans it services and commingles funds in transit to or from the Plan, including other funds similarly in transit to or from other plans and (ii) if markets permit, omnibus account balances may be invested in short-term investments with the aim of earning a rate approximating the Target Federal Funds Rate and/or money market rates (such earnings are referred to as "float earnings"); and (iii) the Trustee will use these earnings to pay bank fees associated with the above-referenced defined contribution plan transactions and make other required adjustments and will retain any float earnings that exceed such fees and adjustments as compensation for its services. The Trustee shall pay bank fees to the extent they exceed float earnings. The amount of float earnings generated depends on market conditions, as well as on the length of time that funds are held in the omnibus accounts. The following time frames apply with respect to funds held in these accounts: &#8226;   If contributions and instructions to purchase investment options are received by the Trustee In Good Order before the close of trading, the Trustee executes transactions in the investment options as of that day's closing price (the "transaction date" or "T"). Contributions are held in the omnibus account until the following business day ("T+1") for the vast majority of investment options. For share accounted company stock transactions, contributions may be held in the omnibus account until T+3. &#8226;   Instructions to exchange investment options received by the Trustee In Good Order before the close of trading are processed in that day's nightly cycle. For the vast majority of investment options, exchanges generate no overnight balances, as money is received from one investment option and conveyed to another investment option on the same business day.  The limited exceptions to this would occur if investment options have different settlement rules and Fidelity Management Trust Company serves as trustee of the Plan, in which case balances attributable to the exchange may remain in an omnibus account for a few days. &#8226;   Instructions to make disbursements received In Good Order before the close of trading are processed in that day's nightly cycle and reflected as debits from participant accounts as of that date ("T").  Proceeds attributable to the disbursement are received into the omnibus account based on the settlement period for the investment options, which in the substantial majority of investment options is T+1. After the deduction of tax withholding, if applicable, disbursements are typically made on T+2 or T+3 either through electronic funds transfers or by mailing a check.  Disbursement proceeds distributed by check, net of any tax withholdings, remain in the omnibus account until the check is presented for payment. Neither the Sponsor nor the Plan shall be liable for any diminution in the value of such overnight investments. Provided that the Sponsor has provided timely funding, neither the Sponsor nor the Plan shall be responsible for any failure to settle or clear from such omnibus accounts any proper or timely trade or disbursement if such failure results from a decrease in the value, or temporary inaccessibility of funds attributable to either the use of a specific bank or the overnight investment of balances from such accounts. (4)   Restating Schedule B, Fee Schedule, in its entirety, as attached herein. (5)   Amending to add Schedule B-1 as attached hereto.



 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Trustee and the Sponsor have caused this Fourth Amendment to be executed by their duly authorized officers effective as of the day and year first above written.  By signing below, the undersigned represent that they are authorized to execute this document on behalf of the respective parties. Notwithstanding any contradictory provision of the agreement that this document amends, each party may rely without duty of inquiry on the foregoing representation. ZIONS BANCORPORATION   FIDELITY MANAGEMENT TRUST COMPANY By: /s/ Diana Andersen 12/5/2014     By: /s/ Greg Gardiner 12/5/2014       Authorized Signatory Date        FMTC Authorized Signatory Date Schedule B - Fee Schedule
