As provided in the Indenture, the bonds may be issued in series for various principal amounts, may bear different dates and mature at different times, may bear interest at different rates and may otherwise vary as in the Indenture provided or permitted. This bond is one of the bonds described in the Forty-ninth Supplemental Indenture (the "Forty-ninth Supplemental Indenture";) dated as of December 1, 2014, and designated therein as "First Mortgage Bond,  4.06% Series due 2045";  in the aggregate principal amount of $13,000,000 (the "Bonds";).

Two Business Days prior to such prepayment, the Company shall deliver to each holder of Bonds a certificate of a Senior Financial Officer specifying the calculation of such Make-Whole Amount as of the specified redemption date.		
		 			If this bond or any portion hereof is called for redemption and payment thereof is duly provided for as specified in the Indenture, interest shall cease to accrue hereon or on such portion, as the case may be, from and after the redemption date. In the event of redemption of this bond in part only, a new bond for the unredeemed portion hereof shall be issued in the name of the holder hereof upon the surrender hereof.		
		 			The principal hereof may be declared or may become due prior to its Maturity Date on the conditions, in the manner and with the effect set forth in the Indenture upon the happening of an event of default, as in the Indenture provided; subject, however, to the right, under certain circumstances, of the registered owners of a majority in principal amount of bonds then outstanding, including the Bonds, to annul such declaration.		
		 			The Company, the Trustee and any Paying Agent may deem and treat the registered owner of this bond as the absolute owner hereof for the purpose of receiving payment of or on account of the principal hereof and the interest hereon, and for all other purposes, and shall not be affected by any notice to the contrary.		
		 			This bond is transferable by the registered owner hereof in person or by attorney duly authorized in writing, on books of the Company to be kept for that purpose at the designated  office of the Trustee in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania upon surrender hereof for cancellation at such office and upon presentation of a written instrument of transfer duly executed, and thereupon the

Two Business Days prior to such prepayment, the Company shall deliver to each holder of Bonds a certificate of a Senior Financial Officer specifying the calculation of such Make-Whole Amount as of the specified redemption date.

		 			The principal hereof may be declared or may become due prior to its Maturity Date on the conditions, in the manner and with the effect set forth in the Indenture upon the happening of an event of default, as in the Indenture provided; subject, however, to the right, under certain circumstances, of the registered owners of a majority in principal amount of bonds then outstanding, including the Bonds, to annul such declaration.		
		 			The Company, the Trustee and any Paying Agent may deem and treat the registered owner of this bond as the absolute owner hereof for the purpose of receiving payment of or on account of the principal hereof and the interest hereon, and for all other purposes, and shall not be affected by any notice to the contrary.		
		 			This bond is transferable by the registered owner hereof in person or by attorney duly authorized in writing, on books of the Company to be kept for that purpose at the designated  office of the Trustee in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania upon surrender hereof for cancellation at such office and upon presentation of a written instrument of transfer duly executed, and thereupon the

		 			No recourse shall be had for the payment of the principal of or interest on this bond or for any claim based hereon or otherwise in respect hereof or of the Indenture or of any indenture supplemental thereto against any incorporator or any past, present or future stockholder, officer or director of the Company or of any predecessor or successor corporation, as such, either directly or through the Company, or through any such predecessor or successor corporation or through any receiver or trustee in bankruptcy, by virtue of any constitutional provision, statute or rule of law or equity, or by the enforcement of any assessment or penalty or otherwise; all such liability being, by the acceptance hereof and as part of the consideration for the issue hereof, expressly waived and released by every holder or registered owner hereof, as more fully provided in the Indenture.		
		 			This bond shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture or any indenture supplemental thereto, or become valid or obligatory for any purpose, until The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.  A., as Trustee under the Indenture, or a successor trustee thereunder, shall have signed the certificate of authentication endorsed hereon.

		 			Provided that no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing, within one hundred and eighty days (180) days of the stated maturity date of any series of Bonds (the period from such date to the stated maturity of such series of Bonds being referred to herein as the "Prepayment Period";), the Company may, at its option, upon prior written notice as provided below, prepay all Bonds of such series at 100% of the principal amount so prepaid, together with interest on such principal amount accrued to the date of prepayment and without any Make-Whole Amount.		
		 			The Company will give each holder of Bonds and the Trustee written notice of each optional redemption under this Section 2 not less than 30 days and not more than 45 days prior to the date fixed for such prepayment. Each such notice shall specify such date (which shall be a Business Day), the aggregate principal amount of the Bonds to be redeemed on such date, the principal amount of each Bond held by such holder to be redeemed (determined in accordance with Section 3 below), and the interest to be paid on the redemption date with respect to such principal amount being redeemed, and shall be accompanied by a certificate of the chief financial officer, principal accounting officer, treasurer or comptroller (each, for purposes of this Article I, a "Senior Financial Officer";) of the Company as to the estimated Make-Whole Amount due in connection with such redemption (calculated as if the date of such notice were the date of the redemption), setting forth the details of such computation. Two Business Days prior to such prepayment, the Company shall deliver to each holder of Bonds and the Trustee a certificate of a Senior Financial Officer specifying the calculation of such Make-Whole Amount as of the specified redemption date.		
		 			The term "Make-Whole Amount"; means, with respect to any Bond, an amount equal to the excess, if any, of the Discounted Value of the Remaining Scheduled Payments with respect to the Called Principal of such Bond over the amount of such Called Principal, provided that the Make-Whole Amount may in no event be less than zero. For the purposes of determining the Make-Whole Amount, the following terms have the following meanings:		
		 			"Called Principal"; means, with respect to any Bond, the principal of such Bond that is to be prepaid pursuant to this Section 2.		
		 			"Discounted Value"; means, with respect to the Called Principal of any Bond, the amount obtained by discounting all Remaining Scheduled Payments with respect to such Called 		
				 			118027225_1		 		 			 		
		 Principal from their respective scheduled due dates to the Settlement Date with respect to such Called Principal, in accordance with accepted financial practice and at a discount factor (applied on the same periodic basis as that on which interest on the Bonds is payable) equal to the Reinvestment Yield with respect to such Called Principal.		
		 			"Reinvestment Yield"; means, with respect to the Called Principal of any Bond, 0.50% over the yield to maturity implied by (i) the yields reported, as of 10:00 AxxPDMxxPD (New York City time) on the second Business Day preceding the Settlement Date with respect to such Called Principal, on the display designated as "Page PX1"; (or such other display as may replace Page PX1) on Bloomberg Financial Markets for the most recently issued actively traded on-the-run UxxPDSxxPD Treasury securities ("Reported";) having a maturity equal to the Remaining Average Life of such Called Principal as of such Settlement Date. If there are no such UxxPDSxxPD Treasury securities Reported having a maturity equal to such Remaining Average Life, then such implied yield to maturity will be determined by (a) converting UxxPDSxxPD Treasury bill quotations to bond equivalent yields in accordance with accepted financial practice and (b) interpolating linearly between the yields Reported for the applicable most recently issued actively traded on-the-run U. S. Treasury securities with the maturities (1) closest to and greater than such Remaining Average Life and (2) closest to and less than such Remaining Average Life. The Reinvestment Yield shall be rounded to the number of decimal places as appears in the interest rate of the applicable Bond.		
		 			If such yields are not Reported or the yields Reported as of such time are not ascertainable (including by way of interpolation), then "Reinvestment Yield"; means, with respect to the Called Principal of any Bond, 0.50% over the yield to maturity implied by the UxxPDSxxPD Treasury constant maturity yields reported, for the latest day for which such yields have been so reported as of the second Business Day preceding the Settlement Date with respect to such Called Principal, in Federal Reserve Statistical Release H.15 (or any comparable successor publication) for the UxxPDSxxPD Treasury constant maturity having a term equal to the Remaining Average Life of such Called Principal as of such Settlement Date.  If there is no such UxxPDSxxPD Treasury constant maturity having a term equal to such Remaining Average Life, such implied yield to maturity will be determined by interpolating linearly between (1) the UxxPDSxxPD Treasury constant maturity so reported with the term closest to and greater than such Remaining Average Life and (2) the UxxPDSxxPD Treasury constant maturity so reported with the term closest to and less than such Remaining Average Life.  The Reinvestment Yield shall be rounded to the number of decimal places as appears in the interest rate of the applicable Note.		
		 			"Remaining Average Life"; means, with respect to any Called Principal, the number of years obtained by dividing (i) such Called Principal into (ii) the sum of the products obtained by multiplying (a) the principal component of each Remaining Scheduled Payment with respect to such Called Principal by (b) the number of years, computed on the basis of a 360 day year composed of twelve 30 day months and calculated to two decimal places, that will elapse between the Settlement Date with respect to such Called Principal and the scheduled due date of such Remaining Scheduled Payment.		
		 			"Remaining Scheduled Payments"; means, with respect to the Called Principal of any Bond, all payments of such Called Principal and interest thereon that would be due after the Settlement Date with respect to such Called Principal if no payment of such Called Principal were made prior to its scheduled due date, provided that if such Settlement Date is not a date on which interest payments are due to be made under the Bonds, then the amount of the next succeeding 		
				 			118027225_1		 		 			 		
		 scheduled interest payment will be reduced by the amount of interest accrued to such Settlement Date and required to be paid on such Settlement Date pursuant to this Section 2.  		
		 			"Settlement Date"; means, with respect to the Called Principal of any Bond, the date on which such Called Principal is to be redeemed pursuant to this Section 2.		
		 			SECTION 3.   In the case of each partial redemption of the Bonds, the principal amount of the Bonds to be redeemed shall be allocated among all of the Bonds at the time outstanding in proportion, as nearly as practicable, to their respective unpaid principal amounts thereof.		
		 			SECTION 4.  Any redemption of the Bonds shall be effected in accordance with the provisions of Article V of the Original Indenture.		
		 			SECTION 5.  All Bonds deemed to have been paid in full as provided in Section 2 and 3 of this Article I of this Forty-ninth Supplemental Indenture shall be surrendered to the Trustee for cancellation, and the Trustee shall forthwith cancel the same and, in accordance with applicable laws and regulations and the Trustee's policies and procedures, and on the written request of the Company, deliver the same to the Company. Any Bond paid in full, whether at maturity or earlier redemption, shall be surrendered to the Company and cancelled and shall not be reissued, and no Bond shall be issued in lieu of the principal amount of such Bond paid at maturity or redemption. In case part of an outstanding Bond shall be deemed to have been partially paid as provided in said Section 2 or Section 3, upon presentation of such Bond at the designated office of the Trustee, the Trustee shall make a notation thereon of the payment of the portion of the principal amount of such Bond so deemed to have been paid unless the registered owner shall elect to surrender such Bond to the Trustee, in which case the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, without charge to the registered owner, Bonds in such authorized denominations as shall be specified by the registered owner for the unpaid balance of the principal amount of such outstanding Bond. The holder of a Bond that has been partially paid, shall not be required to surrender such Bond to the Trustee or the Company; provided, however, prior to any sale or other disposition of any Bond by a holder thereof, such holder will either endorse thereon the amount of principal paid thereon and the last date to which interest has been paid thereon or surrender such Bond to the Company in exchange for a new Bond or Bonds pursuant to Article II of the Original Indenture.  		
		 			SECTION 6.The 3.64% Series due 2035 in the aggregate principal amount of $25,000,000, the 4.01% Series due 2040 in the aggregate principal amount of $15,000,000, the 4.06% Series due 2045 in the aggregate principal amount of $13,000,000 and the 4.11% Series due 2054 in the aggregate principal amount of $12,000,000 may be issued under the provisions of Article IV of the Original Indenture and may forthwith be executed by the Company and delivered to the Trustee and shall be authenticated by the Trustee and delivered to or upon the order of the Company, upon receipt by the Trustee of the resolutions, certificates, opinions or other instruments or all of the foregoing required to be delivered upon the issue of bonds pursuant to the provisions of the Original Indenture.
