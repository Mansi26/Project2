   Dear Sir or Madam:



   The undersigned serves as counsel to ING Life Insurance and Annuity Company, a Connecticut life



   insurance company (the "Company"). It is my understanding that the Company, as depositor, has



   registered an indefinite amount of securities (the "Securities") under the Securities Act of 1933 (the



   "Securities Act") as provided in Rule 24f-2 under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "Investment



   Company Act").



   In connection with this opinion, I or those for whom I have supervisory responsibility, have reviewed the



   N-4 Registration Statement, as amended to the date hereof, and this Post-Effective Amendment No. 27.



   I have also examined originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to my satisfaction, of such



   documents, trust records and other instruments I have deemed necessary or appropriate for the purpose of



   rendering this opinion. For purposes of such examination, I have assumed the genuineness of all signatures



   on original documents and the conformity to the original of all copies.



   * Pursuant to Rule 429(a) under the Securities Act of 1933, Registrant has included a combined prospectus under



   this Registration Statement which includes all the information which would currently be required in a prospectus



   relating to the securities covered by Registration Statement No. 33-75984.

   Windsor, CT 06095-4774



	
I am admitted to practice law in Connecticut, and do not purport to be an expert on the laws of any other


	
state. My opinion herein as to any other law is based upon a limited inquiry thereof which I have deemed


	
appropriate under the circumstances.


	
Based upon the foregoing, and, assuming the Securities are sold in accordance with the provisions of the


	
prospectus, I am of the opinion that the Securities being registered will be legally issued and will represent


	
binding obligations of the Company.


	
I consent to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit to the Registration Statement.


	
Sincerely,


	
/s/ J Neil McMurdie
