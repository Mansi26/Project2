Except as otherwise defined herein, capitalized terms in this Warrant shall have the meanings set forth in Section 16. This Warrant is one of the Warrants to Purchase Common Stock (the "Lender Warrants") issued pursuant to Section 3.4.1 of that certain Second Amendment to Credit Agreement dated as of June 1, 2012, by and among the Company, the other Obligors, the Administrative Agent, and the Lenders (the "Lenders") referred to therein (the "Loan Agreement"). 1    The warrants were issued to the lenders in the following allocations: Lender   Percent of Common Stock Outstanding Fifth Third Bank   4.7810% Associated Bank, NxxPDAxxPD   3.7905% Bank of America, NxxPDAxxPD   7.5810% Private Bank and Trust Company   3.7905% 1.   EXERCISE OF WARRANT. (a)Mechanics of Exercise . Subject to the terms and conditions hereof (including, without limitation, the limitations set forth in Section 1(e)), this Warrant may be exercised by the Holder on any Business Day on or after the Initial Exercise Date (an "Exercise Date"), in whole or in part, by delivery (whether via facsimile or otherwise) of a duly completed written notice, in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A (the "Exercise Notice"), of the Holder's election to exercise this Warrant. Within one (1) Trading Day following an exercise of this Warrant as aforesaid, the Holder shall deliver payment to the Company of an amount equal to the Exercise Price in effect on the date of such exercise multiplied by the number of Warrant Shares as to which this Warrant was so exercised (the "Aggregate Exercise Price") in cash or via wire transfer of immediately available funds if the Holder did not notify the Company in such Exercise Notice that such exercise was made pursuant to a Cashless Exercise (as defined in Section 1(c)). The Holder shall not be required to deliver the original of this Warrant in order to effect an exercise hereunder. Execution and delivery of an Exercise Notice with respect to less than all of the Warrant Shares shall have the same effect as cancellation of the original of this Warrant and issuance of a new Warrant evidencing the right to purchase the remaining number of Warrant Shares. Execution and delivery of an Exercise Notice for all of the then-remaining Warrant Shares shall have the same effect as cancellation of the original of this Warrant after delivery of the Warrant Shares in accordance with the terms hereof. On or before the second (2nd) Trading Day following the date on which the Company has received an Exercise Notice, the Company shall transmit by facsimile an acknowledgment of confirmation of receipt of such Exercise Notice, in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B, to the Holder and the Company's transfer agent (the "Transfer Agent"). On or before the fifth (5th) Trading Day following the date on which the Company has received such Exercise Notice, the Company shall (X) provided that the Transfer Agent is participating in The Depository Trust Company ("DTC") Fast Automated Securities Transfer Program, upon the request of the Holder, credit such aggregate number of shares of Common Stock to which the Holder is entitled pursuant to such exercise to the Holder's or its designee's balance account with DTC through its Deposit/ Withdrawal at Custodian system, or (Y) if the Transfer Agent is not participating in the DTC Fast Automated Securities Transfer Program, issue and deliver to the Holder or, at the Holder's instruction pursuant to the Exercise Notice, the Holder's agent or designee, in each case, sent by reputable overnight courier to the address as specified in the applicable Exercise Notice, a certificate, registered in the Company's share register in the name of the Holder or its designee (as indicated in the applicable Exercise Notice), for the number of shares of Common Stock to which the Holder is entitled pursuant to such exercise. The Company may issue the Warrant Shares from its treasury stock or from its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock. Upon delivery of an Exercise Notice and delivery of the Aggregate Purchase Price, the Holder shall be deemed for all corporate purposes to have become the holder of record of the Warrant Shares with respect to which this Warrant has been exercised, irrespective of the date such Warrant Shares are credited to the Holder's DTC account or the date of delivery of the certificates evidencing such Warrant Shares (as the case may be). If this Warrant is submitted in connection with any exercise pursuant to this Section 1(a) and the number of Warrant Shares represented by this Warrant submitted for exercise is greater than the number of Warrant Shares being acquired upon an exercise, then, at the request of the Holder, the Company shall as soon as practicable and in no event later than three (3) Business Days after any exercise and at its own expense, issue and deliver to the Holder (or its designee) a new Warrant (in accordance with Section 7(d)) representing the right to purchase the number of Warrant Shares purchasable immediately prior to such exercise under this Warrant, less the number of Warrant Shares with respect to which this Warrant is exercised. No fractional shares of Common Stock are to be issued upon the exercise of this Warrant, but rather Company will pay to such Holder an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the fraction multiplied by (ii) the Fair Market Value (as defined below) of one share of Common Stock. The Company shall pay any and all documentary stamp taxes and fees which may be payable with respect to the issuance and delivery of Warrant Shares upon exercise of this Warrant provided, that, the Company will not be required to pay any tax or taxes that may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issue of any Warrants or any shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise thereof in a name other than the Holder of such Warrant. (b)Exercise Price . For purposes of this Warrant, "Exercise Price" means $0.40, subject to adjustment as provided herein. (c)Cashless Exercise . Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary (other than Section 1(e) below), the Holder may, in its sole discretion, exercise this Warrant in whole or in part and, in lieu of making the cash payment otherwise contemplated to be made to the Company upon such exercise in payment of the Aggregate Exercise Price, elect instead to receive upon such exercise the "Net Number" of shares of Common Stock determined according to the following formula (a "Cashless Exercise"): Net Number = (A x B) - (A x C) B For purposes of the foregoing formula: A= the total number of shares with respect to which this Warrant is then being exercised. B= the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock on the Exercise Date. C= the Exercise Price then in effect for the applicable Warrant Shares at the time of such exercise. (d)Disputes . In the case of a dispute as to the determination of the Exercise Price or the arithmetic calculation of the number of Warrant Shares to be issued pursuant to the terms hereof, the Company shall promptly issue to the Holder the number of Warrant Shares that are not disputed and resolve such dispute in accordance with Section 13. (e)Limitations on Exercises. (i)Beneficial Ownership. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Warrant, this Warrant shall not be exercisable by the Holder hereof to the extent (but only to the extent) that the Holder or any of its affiliates would, individually or jointly, beneficially own in excess of  4.99% (the "Maximum Percentage") of the Common Stock. To the extent the above limitation applies, the determination of whether this Warrant shall be exercisable (vis-&#224;-vis other convertible, exercisable or exchangeable securities owned by the Holder or any of its affiliates) and of which such securities shall be exercisable (as among all such securities owned by the Holder) shall, subject to such Maximum Percentage limitation, be determined on the basis of the first submission to the Company for conversion, exercise or exchange (as the case may be). No prior inability to exercise this Warrant pursuant to this paragraph shall have any effect on the applicability of the provisions of this paragraph with respect to any subsequent determination of exercisability. For the purposes of this paragraph, beneficial ownership and all determinations and calculations (including, without limitation, with respect to calculations of percentage ownership) shall be determined in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Act, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the "1934 Act"). The provisions of this paragraph shall be implemented in a manner otherwise than in strict conformity with the terms of this paragraph to correct this paragraph (or any portion hereof) which may be defective or inconsistent with the intended Maximum Percentage beneficial ownership limitation herein contained or to make changes or supplements necessary or desirable to properly give effect to such Maximum Percentage limitation. The limitations contained in this paragraph shall apply to a successor Holder of this Warrant. The holders of Common Stock shall be third party beneficiaries of this paragraph and the Company may not waive this paragraph without the consent of holders of a majority of its Common Stock. For any reason at any time, upon the written or oral request of the Holder, the Company shall within two (2) Business Days confirm orally and in writing to the Holder the number of shares of Common Stock then outstanding, including by virtue of any prior conversion or exercise of convertible or exercisable securities into Common Stock, including, without limitation, pursuant to this Warrant or securities issued pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement. By written notice to the Company, any Holder may increase or decrease the Maximum Percentage to any other percentage not in excess of 9.99% specified in such notice; provided that (i) any such increase will not be effective until the 61st day after such notice is delivered to the Company, and (ii) any such increase or decrease will apply only to the Holder sending such notice and not to any other holder of Lender Warrants. For the avoidance of doubt, solely with respect to the calculations in this Section 1(e)(i), shares of Common Stock that may not be issued to the Holder pursuant to Sections 1(e)(ii) or 1(f) hereof shall be disregarded for purposes of determining the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon a conversion or other issuance hereunder until such time, if any, as such applicable restrictions or prohibitions no longer apply. (ii)Principal Market Regulation. The Company shall not issue any shares of Common Stock upon exercise of this Warrant if the issuance of such shares of Common Stock would exceed the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock which the Company may issue upon exercise of the Lender Warrants without breaching the Company's obligations under the rules or regulations of the Principal Market (the number of shares which may be issued without violating such rules and regulations, the "Exchange Cap"), except that such limitation shall not apply in the event that the Company (A) obtains the approval of its stockholders as required by the applicable rules of the Principal Market for issuances of shares of Common Stock in excess of such amount or (B) obtains a written opinion from outside counsel to the Company that such approval is not required, which opinion shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Holder. Until such approval or such written opinion is obtained, no Lender shall be issued in the aggregate, upon exercise of any Lender Warrants, shares of Common Stock in an amount greater than the product of the Exchange Cap multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the total number of shares of Common Stock underlying the Lender Warrants issued to such Lender pursuant to the Loan Agreement on the Initial Issuance Date and the denominator of which is the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock underlying the Lender Warrants issued to the Lenders pursuant to the Loan Agreement on the Initial Issuance Date (with respect to each Lender, the "Exchange Cap Allocation"). In the event that any Lender shall sell or otherwise transfer any of such Lender's Lender Warrants, the transferee shall be allocated a pro rata portion of such Lender's Exchange Cap Allocation, and the restrictions of the prior sentence shall apply to such transferee with respect to the portion of the Exchange Cap Allocation allocated to such transferee. In the event that any holder of Lender Warrants shall exercise all of such holder's Lender Warrants into a number of shares of Common Stock which, in the aggregate, is less than such holder's Exchange Cap Allocation, then the difference between such holder's Exchange Cap Allocation and the number of shares of Common Stock actually issued to such holder shall be allocated to the respective Exchange Cap Allocations of the remaining holders of Lender Warrants on a pro rata basis in proportion to the shares of Common Stock underlying the Lender Warrants then held by each such holder. In the event that the Company is prohibited from issuing any Warrant Shares ninety (90) days after the date for which an Exercise Notice has been received, as a result of the operation of this Section 1(e)(ii), the Company shall pay cash in exchange for cancellation of such Warrant Shares, at a price per Warrant Share equal to the difference between the Fair Market Value and the Exercise Price as of the date of the attempted exercise. (f)Insufficient Authorized Shares . The Company shall at all times keep reserved for issuance under this Warrant a number of shares of Common Stock as shall be necessary to satisfy the Company's obligation to issue shares of Common Stock hereunder (without regard to any limitation otherwise contained herein with respect to the number of shares of Common Stock that may be acquirable upon exercise of this Warrant). If, notwithstanding the foregoing, and not in limitation thereof, at any time while any of the Lender Warrants remain outstanding the Company does not have a sufficient number of authorized and unreserved shares of Common Stock to satisfy its obligation to reserve for issuance upon exercise of the Lender Warrants at least a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the number of shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be necessary to effect the exercise of all of the Lender Warrants then outstanding (the "Required Reserve Amount") (an "Authorized Share Failure"), then the Company shall immediately take all action necessary to increase the Company's authorized shares of Common Stock to an amount sufficient to allow the Company to reserve the Required Reserve Amount for all the Lender Warrants then outstanding. 2.   ADJUSTMENT OF EXERCISE PRICE AND NUMBER OF WARRANT SHARES. (a)Exercise Price; Par Value. In the event the Company takes any action that reduces the par value of its Common Stock, whether by amendment of its Certificate of Incorporation or otherwise in connection with any subdivision, combination, reorganization or reclassification of Common Stock that does not involve a Fundamental Transaction, the Exercise Price shall be automatically reduced to such lower par value. The Company shall not take any action to increase the par value of its Common Stock, whether by amendment of its Certificate of Incorporation or otherwise in connection with any subdivision, combination, reorganization or reclassification of Common Stock that does not involve a Fundamental Transaction. (b)Other Actions that have the effect of a Dilutive Issuance. In the event that the Company shall take any action which would operate to cause the Holder's right to purchase the percentage of Common Stock Deemed Outstanding in accordance herewith to be effectively diluted (including, without limitation, the granting of stock appreciation rights, phantom stock rights or other rights with equity features), then the Company's board of directors shall in good faith determine and implement an appropriate adjustment in the number of Warrant Shares so as to protect the rights of the Holder, provided that no such adjustment pursuant to this Section 2(b) will decrease the Exercise Price below the par value of the Common Stock, provided further that if the Holder does not accept such adjustments as appropriately protecting its interests hereunder against such dilution, then the Company's board of directors and the Holder shall agree, in good faith, upon an independent investment bank of nationally recognized standing to make such appropriate adjustments, whose determination shall be final and binding and whose fees and expenses shall be borne by the Company. 3.[INTENTIONALLY OMITTED] 4.   FUNDAMENTAL TRANSACTIONS. (a)Fundamental Transaction. The Company shall not enter into or be party to a Fundamental Transaction unless (i)  the Successor Entity assumes in writing all of the obligations of the Company under this Warrant in accordance with the provisions of this Section 4 pursuant to written agreements in form and substance satisfactory to the Holder and approved by the Holder prior to such Fundamental Transaction, including agreements to deliver to the Holder in exchange for this Warrant a security of the Successor Entity evidenced by a written instrument substantially similar in form and substance to this Warrant, including, without limitation, which is exercisable for a corresponding number of shares of capital stock equivalent to the shares of Common Stock acquirable and receivable upon exercise of this Warrant (without regard to any limitations on the exercise of this Warrant) prior to such Fundamental Transaction, and with an exercise price which applies the exercise price hereunder to such shares of capital stock (but taking into account the relative value of the shares of Common Stock pursuant to such Fundamental Transaction and the value of such shares of capital stock, such adjustments to the number of shares of capital stock and such exercise price being for the purpose of protecting the economic value of this Warrant immediately prior to the consummation of such Fundamental Transaction) and (ii) the Successor Entity (including its Parent Entity) is a publicly traded corporation whose common stock is quoted on or listed for trading on an Eligible Market. Upon the consummation of each Fundamental Transaction, the Successor Entity shall succeed to, and be substituted for (so that from and after the date of the applicable Fundamental Transaction, the provisions of this Warrant referring to the "Company" shall refer instead to the Successor Entity), and may exercise every right and power of the Company and shall assume all of the obligations of the Company under this Warrant with the same effect as if such Successor Entity had been named as the Company herein. Upon consummation of each Fundamental Transaction, the Successor Entity shall deliver to the Holder confirmation that there shall be issued upon exercise of this Warrant at any time after the consummation of the applicable Fundamental Transaction, in lieu of the shares of Common Stock (or other securities, cash, assets or other property (except such items still issuable under Section 3 above, which shall continue to be receivable thereafter)) issuable upon the exercise of this Warrant prior to the applicable Fundamental Transaction, such shares of publicly traded common stock (or its equivalent) of the Successor Entity (including its Parent Entity) which the Holder would have been entitled to receive upon the happening of the applicable Fundamental Transaction had this Warrant been exercised immediately prior to the applicable Fundamental Transaction (without regard to any limitations on the exercise of this Warrant), as adjusted in accordance with the provisions of this Warrant. In addition to and not in substitution for any other rights hereunder, prior to the consummation of each Fundamental Transaction pursuant to which holders of shares of Common Stock are entitled to receive securities or other assets with respect to or in exchange for shares of Common Stock (a "Corporate Event"), the Company shall make appropriate provision to insure that the Holder will thereafter have the right to receive upon an exercise of this Warrant at any time after the consummation of the applicable Fundamental Transaction but prior to the Expiration Date, in lieu of the shares of the Common Stock (or other securities, cash, assets or other property (except such items still issuable under Section 3 above, which shall continue to be receivable thereafter)) issuable upon the exercise of the Warrant prior to such Fundamental Transaction, such shares of stock, securities, cash, assets or any other property whatsoever (including warrants or other purchase or subscription rights) which the Holder would have been entitled to receive upon the happening of the applicable Fundamental Transaction had this Warrant been exercised immediately prior to the applicable Fundamental Transaction (without regard to any limitations on the exercise of this Warrant). Provision made pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be in a form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Holder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, and without limiting Section 1(e) hereof, (i) the Holder may elect, at its sole option, by delivery of written notice to the Company to waive this Section 4 to permit the Fundamental Transaction without the assumption of this Warrant and (ii) in connection with the closing of a Fundamental Transaction, the Company may require the Holder to exercise its Warrant immediately prior to the closing of a Fundamental Transaction. (b)Application. The provisions of this Section 4 shall apply similarly and equally to successive Fundamental Transactions and shall be applied as if this Warrant (and any such subsequent warrants) were fully exercisable and without regard to any limitations on the exercise of this Warrant (provided that the Holder shall continue to be entitled to the benefit of the Maximum Percentage and Exchange Cap, applied however with respect to shares of capital stock registered under the 1934 Act and thereafter receivable upon exercise of this Warrant (or any such other warrant)). 5.NONCIRCUMVENTION. The Company hereby covenants and agrees that the Company will not, by amendment of its Certificate of Incorporation, bylaws, or through any reorganization, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, scheme of arrangement, dissolution, issue or sale of securities, or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms of this Warrant, and will at all times in good faith carry out all the provisions of this Warrant and take all action as may be required to protect the rights of the Holder. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company (i) shall not increase the par value of any shares of Common Stock receivable upon the exercise of this Warrant above the Exercise Price then in effect, (ii) shall take all such actions as may be necessary or appropriate in order that the Company may validly and legally issue fully paid and non-assessable shares of Common Stock upon the exercise of this Warrant, and (iii) shall, so long as any of the Lender Warrants are outstanding, take all action necessary to reserve and keep available out of its authorized and unissued shares of Common Stock, solely for the purpose of effecting the exercise of the Lender Warrants, the maximum number of shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be necessary to effect the exercise of the Lender Warrants then outstanding (without regard to any limitations on exercise). 6.WARRANT HOLDER NOT DEEMED A STOCKHOLDER. Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, the Holder, solely in its capacity as a holder of this Warrant, shall not be entitled to vote or receive dividends or be deemed the holder of share capital of the Company for any purpose, nor shall anything contained in this Warrant be construed to confer upon the Holder, solely in its capacity as the Holder of this Warrant, any of the rights of a stockholder of the Company or any right to vote, give or withhold consent to any corporate action (whether any reorganization, issue of stock, reclassification of stock, consolidation, merger, conveyance or otherwise), receive notice of meetings, receive dividends or subscription rights, or otherwise, prior to the issuance to the Holder of the Warrant Shares which it is then entitled to receive upon the due exercise of this Warrant. In addition, nothing contained in this Warrant shall be construed as imposing any liabilities on the Holder to purchase any securities (upon exercise of this Warrant or otherwise) or as a stockholder of the Company, whether such liabilities are asserted by the Company or by creditors of the Company. Notwithstanding this Section 6, the Company shall provide the Holder with copies of the same notices and other information given to the stockholders of the Company generally, contemporaneously with the giving thereof to the stockholders. 7.REISSUANCE OF WARRANTS. (a)Transfer of Warrant . If this Warrant is to be transferred, the Holder shall surrender this Warrant to the Company, whereupon the Company will forthwith issue and deliver upon the order of the Holder a new Warrant (in accordance with Section 7(d)), registered as the Holder may request, representing the right to purchase the number of Warrant Shares being transferred by the Holder and, if less than the total number of Warrant Shares then underlying this Warrant is being transferred, a new Warrant (in accordance with Section 7(d)) to the Holder representing the right to purchase the number of Warrant Shares not being transferred. (b)Lost, Stolen or Mutilated Warrant . Upon receipt by the Company of evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Company of the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of this Warrant (as to which a written certification and the indemnification contemplated below shall suffice as such evidence), and, in the case of loss, theft or destruction, of any indemnification undertaking by the Holder to the Company in customary and reasonable form and, in the case of mutilation, upon surrender and cancellation of this Warrant, the Company shall execute and deliver to the Holder a new Warrant (in accordance with Section 7(d)) representing the right to purchase the Warrant Shares then underlying this Warrant. (c)Exchangeable for Multiple Warrants . This Warrant is exchangeable, upon the surrender hereof by the Holder at the principal office of the Company, for a new Warrant or Warrants (in accordance with Section 7(d)) representing in the aggregate the right to purchase the number of Warrant Shares then underlying this Warrant, and each such new Warrant will represent the right to purchase such portion of such Warrant Shares as is designated by the Holder at the time of such surrender; provided, however, no warrants for fractional shares of Common Stock shall be given. (d)Issuance of New Warrants . Whenever the Company is required to issue a new Warrant pursuant to the terms of this Warrant, such new Warrant (i) shall be of like tenor with this Warrant, (ii) shall represent, as indicated on the face of such new Warrant, the right to purchase the Warrant Shares then underlying this Warrant (or in the case of a new Warrant being issued pursuant to Section 7(a) or Section 7(c), the Warrant Shares designated by the Holder which, when added to the number of shares of Common Stock underlying the other new Warrants issued in connection with such issuance, does not exceed the number of Warrant Shares then underlying this Warrant), (iii) shall have an issuance date, as indicated on the face of such new Warrant which is the same as the Issuance Date, and (iv) shall have the same rights and conditions as this Warrant. 8.   NOTICES. Whenever notice is required to be given under this Warrant, unless otherwise provided herein, such notice shall be given in accordance with the Loan Agreement. The Company shall provide the Holder with prompt written notice of all actions taken pursuant to this Warrant, including in reasonable detail a description of such action and the reason therefor. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company will give written notice to the Holder (i) immediately upon each adjustment of the Exercise Price and the number of Warrant Shares, setting forth in reasonable detail, and certifying, the calculation of such adjustment(s) and (ii) at least fifteen (15) days prior to the date on which the Company closes its books or takes a record (A) with respect to any dividend or distribution upon the shares of Common Stock, (B) with respect to any grants, issuances or sales of any Options, Convertible Securities or rights to purchase stock, warrants, securities or other property to holders of shares of Common Stock or (C) for determining rights to vote with respect to any Fundamental Transaction, dissolution or liquidation, provided in each case that such information shall be made known to the public prior to or in conjunction with such notice being provided to the Holder and (iii) at least ten (10) Trading Days prior to the consummation of any Fundamental Transaction. To the extent that any notice provided hereunder constitutes, or contains, material, non-public information regarding the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, the Company shall simultaneously file such notice with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to a Current Report on Form 8-K. It is expressly understood and agreed that the time of execution specified by the Holder in each Exercise Notice shall be definitive and may not be disputed or challenged by the Company. 9.AMENDMENT AND WAIVER. Except as otherwise provided herein, the provisions of this Warrant (other than Section 1(e)) may be amended and the Company may take any action herein prohibited, or omit to perform any act herein required to be performed by it, only if the Company has obtained the written consent of the Holder. The Holder shall be entitled, at its option, to the benefit of any amendment of (i) any other similar warrant issued under the Loan Agreement or (ii) any other similar warrant. No waiver shall be effective unless it is in writing and signed by an authorized representative of the waiving party. 10.SEVERABILITY. If any provision of this Warrant is prohibited by law or otherwise determined to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, the provision that would otherwise be prohibited, invalid or unenforceable shall be deemed amended to apply to the broadest extent that it would be valid and enforceable, and the invalidity or unenforceability of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of this Warrant so long as this Warrant as so modified continues to express, without material change, the original intentions of the parties as to the subject matter hereof and the prohibited nature, invalidity or unenforceability of the provision(s) in question does not substantially impair the respective expectations or reciprocal obligations of the parties or the practical realization of the benefits that would otherwise be conferred upon the parties. The parties will endeavor in good faith negotiations to replace the prohibited, invalid or unenforceable provision(s) with a valid provision(s), the effect of which comes as close as possible to that of the prohibited, invalid or unenforceable provision(s). 11.GOVERNING LAW. This Warrant shall be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with, and all questions concerning the construction, validity, interpretation and performance of this Warrant shall be governed by, the internal laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to any choice of law or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of New York or any other jurisdictions) that would cause the application of the laws of any jurisdictions other than the State of New York. The Company hereby irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts sitting in The City of New York, Borough of Manhattan, for the adjudication of any dispute hereunder or in connection herewith or with any transaction contemplated hereby or discussed herein, and hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert in any suit, action or proceeding, any claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of any such court, that such suit, action or proceeding is brought in an inconvenient forum or that the venue of such suit, action or proceeding is improper. Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to limit in any way any right to serve process in any manner permitted by law.

THE COMPANY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO, AND AGREES NOT TO REQUEST, A JURY TRIAL FOR THE ADJUDICATION OF ANY DISPUTE HEREUNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH OR ARISING OUT OF THIS WARRANT OR ANY TRANSACTION CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. 12.CONSTRUCTION; HEADINGS. This Warrant shall be deemed to be jointly drafted by the Company and the Holder and shall not be construed against any Person as the drafter hereof. The headings of this Warrant are for convenience of reference and shall not form part of, or affect the interpretation of, this Warrant. 13.DISPUTE RESOLUTION. In the case of a dispute as to the determination of the Exercise Price, the Closing Sale Price, the or Fair Market Value or the arithmetic calculation of the Warrant Shares (as the case may be), the Company or the Holder (as the case may be) shall submit the disputed determination or arithmetic calculation (as the case may be) via facsimile (i) within two (2) Business Days after delivery of the applicable notice giving rise to such dispute to the Company or the Holder (as the case may be) or (ii) if no notice gave rise to such dispute, at any time after the Holder learned of the circumstances giving rise to such dispute. If the Holder and the Company are unable to agree upon such determination or calculation (as the case may be) of the Exercise Price, the Closing Sale Price, or Fair Market Value or the number of Warrant Shares (as the case may be) by 5:00 pxxPDmxxPD (New York time) on the third (3rd) Business Day following the delivery by the Company or the Holder (as the case may be) of such disputed determination or arithmetic calculation to the Company or the Holder (as the case may be), then the Company shall, no later than 5:00 pxxPDmxxPD (New York time) on the second (2nd) Business Day immediately following such third (3rd) Business Day, submit (via facsimile) (a) the disputed determination of the Exercise Price, the Closing Sale Price, or Fair Market Value (as the case may be) to an independent, reputable investment bank selected by the Holder or (b) the disputed arithmetic calculation of the Warrant Shares to an independent, reputable accountant selected by the Holder (it being understood and agreed that the Holder shall be entitled to submit the disputed determination or arithmetic calculation (as the case may be) at any time after the Company fails to so submit the disputed determination or arithmetic calculation (as the case may be) by 5:00 pxxPDmxxPD (New York time) on such second (2nd) Business Day). The Company shall cause at its expense the investment bank or the accountant (as the case may be) to perform the determination or calculation (as the case may be) and notify the Company and the Holder of the results no later than ten (10) Business Days from the time it receives such disputed determination or calculation (as the case may be). Such investment bank's or accountant's determination or calculation (as the case may be) shall be binding upon all parties absent demonstrable error. 14.REMEDIES, CHARACTERIZATION, OTHER OBLIGATIONS, BREACHES AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF. The remedies provided in this Warrant shall be cumulative and in addition to all other remedies available under this Warrant and the Loan Agreement, at law or in equity (including a decree of specific performance and/or other injunctive relief), and nothing herein shall limit the right of the Holder to pursue actual and consequential damages for any failure by the Company to comply with the terms of this Warrant. The Company covenants to the Holder that there shall be no characterization concerning this instrument other than as expressly provided herein.
