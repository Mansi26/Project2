   Ladies and Gentlemen:



   The undersigned serves as counsel to ING Life Insurance and Annuity Company, a Connecticut life



   insurance company (the "Company"). It is my understanding that the Company, as depositor, has



   registered an indefinite amount of securities (the "Securities") under the Securities Act of 1933 (the



   "Securities Act") as provided in Rule 24f-2 under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "Investment



   Company Act").



   In connection with this opinion, I have reviewed the N-4 Registration, as amended to the date hereof, and



   this Post-Effective Amendment No. 6. I have also examined originals or copies, certified or otherwise



   identified to my satisfaction, of such documents, trust records and other instruments I have deemed



   necessary or appropriate for the purpose of rendering this opinion. For purpose of such examination, I



   have assumed the genuineness of all signatures on original documents and the conformity to the original



   of all copies.



   I am admitted to practice law in Connecticut, and do not purport to be an expert on the laws of any other



   state. My opinion herein as to any other law is based upon a limited inquiry thereof which I have deemed



   appropriate under the circumstances.

represent binding obligations of the Company.


	



	
I consent to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit to the Registration Statement.



Sincerely,
