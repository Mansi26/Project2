I have alsoexamined originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to my satisfaction, of such documents, trustrecords and other instruments I have deemed necessary or appropriate for the purpose of rendering thisopinion. For purposes of such examination, I have assumed the genuineness of all signatures on originaldocuments and the conformity to the original of all copies.I am admitted to practice law in Connecticut, and do not purport to be an expert on the laws of any otherstate. My opinion herein as to any other law is based upon a limited inquiry thereof which I have deemedappropriate under the circumstances.Based upon the foregoing, and, assuming the Securities are sold in accordance with the provisions of theprospectus, I am of the opinion that the Securities being registered will be legally issued and willrepresent binding obligations of the Company.I consent to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit to the Registration Statement.Sincerely,/s/ J.
