CAPITALIZED TERMS. Capitalized terms used herein without definition shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture. 2.    AGREEMENT TO GUARANTEE. The Guaranteeing Subsidiary hereby, jointly and severally, agrees to unconditionally guarantee on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Note Guarantee and in the Indenture including but not limited to Article 11 thereof. 3.
