		    			 				 (c)			Delivery of Timeshare Loan Documents.

		    			 				 (e)			Limitation of Liability.  None of the Issuer, the Depositor or any subsequent assignee of the Issuer shall have any obligation or liability with respect to any Timeshare Loan nor shall the Issuer, the Depositor or any subsequent assignee have any liability to any Obligor in respect of any Timeshare Loan.  No such obligation or liability is intended to be assumed by the Issuer, the Depositor or any subsequent assignee herewith and any such liability is hereby expressly disclaimed.
		    			 				 SECTION 3.			Intended Characterization; Grant of Security Interest.  It is the intention of the parties hereto that each transfer of the Timeshare Loans to be made pursuant to the terms hereof shall constitute a sale by the Depositor to the Issuer and not a loan secured by the Timeshare Loans.  In the event, however, that a court of competent jurisdiction were to hold 				    		 			3				 			 		
		 that any such transfer constitutes a loan and not a sale, it is the intention of the parties hereto that the Depositor shall be deemed to have granted to the Issuer as of the date hereof a first priority perfected security interest in all of the Depositor's right, title and interest in, to and under the Assets and the QSTL Assets (as hereinafter defined) specified in Section 2 hereof and Section 6(f) hereof, respectively, and the proceeds thereof and that with respect to such transfer, this Agreement shall constitute a security agreement under applicable law.  In the event of the characterization of any such transfer as a loan, the amount of interest payable or paid with respect to such loan under the terms of this Agreement shall be limited to an amount which shall not exceed the maximum non-usurious rate of interest allowed by the applicable state law or any applicable law of the United States permitting a higher maximum non-usurious rate that preempts such applicable state law, which could lawfully be contracted for, charged or received (the "Highest Lawful Rate";).  In the event any payment of interest on any such loan exceeds the Highest Lawful Rate, the parties hereto stipulate that (a) to the extent possible given the term of such loan, such excess amount previously paid or to be paid with respect to such loan be applied to reduce the principal balance of such loan, and the provisions thereof immediately be deemed reformed and the amounts thereafter collectible thereunder reduced, without the necessity of the execution of any new document, so as to comply with the then applicable law, but so as to permit the recovery of the fullest amount otherwise called for thereunder and (b) to the extent that the reduction of the principal balance of, and the amounts collectible under, such loan and the reformation of the provisions thereof described in the immediately preceding clause (a) is not possible given the term of such loan, such excess amount will be deemed to have been paid with respect to such loan as a result of an error and upon discovery of such error or upon notice thereof by any party hereto such amount shall be refunded by the recipient thereof.
		 			The characterization of the Depositor as "debtor"; and the Issuer as "secured party"; in any such security agreement and any related financing statements required hereunder is solely for protective purposes and shall in no way be construed as being contrary to the intent of the parties that this transaction be treated as a sale to the Issuer of the Depositor's entire right, title and interest in and to the Assets and the QSTL Assets.		
		 			Each of the Depositor, the Club, the Club Trustee and any of their Affiliates, hereby agrees to make the appropriate entries in its general accounting records to indicate that the Timeshare Loans have been transferred to the Issuer, pledged to the Indenture Trustee and constitute a part of the Issuer's estate in accordance with the terms of the Trust created under the Trust Agreement.		
		    			 				 SECTION 4.			Conditions Precedent to Acquisition of Timeshare Loans by the Issuer.  The obligations of the Issuer to purchase any Timeshare Loans hereunder shall be subject to the satisfaction of the following conditions:
		    			 				 (a)			All representations and warranties of the Depositor contained in Section 5 and in Schedule I hereof, and all information provided in the Schedule of Timeshare Loans or as updated with respect to the related Subsequent Transfer Notice shall be true and correct as of the Closing Date or Transfer Date, as applicable, and the Depositor shall have delivered to the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee and the Initial Purchasers an Officer's Certificate to such effect.

		    			 				 (c)			The Depositor shall have delivered or caused to be delivered all other information theretofore required or reasonably requested by the Issuer to be delivered by the Depositor or performed or caused to be performed all other obligations required to be performed as of the Closing Date or the Transfer Date, as the case may be, including all filings, recordings and/or registrations as may be necessary in the reasonable opinion of the Issuer or the Indenture Trustee to establish and preserve the right, title and interest of the Issuer or the Indenture Trustee, as the case may be, in the related Timeshare Loans.

		    			 				 SECTION 5.			Representations and Warranties and Certain Covenants of the Depositor.
		    			 				 (a)			The Depositor represents and warrants to the Issuer and the Indenture Trustee for the benefit of the Noteholders, on the Closing Date (with respect to the Initial Timeshare Loans) and on each Transfer Date (with respect to only the 				    		 			5

		    			 				 (xviii)			The Depositor hereby represents and warrants to the Issuer and the Indenture Trustee that it has entered into the Transfer Agreement and the Bluegreen Purchase Agreement, that the Club Originator has made the representations and warranties in the Transfer Agreement and the Bluegreen Purchase Agreement as set forth therein, that such representations and warranties run to and are for the benefit of the Depositor, the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee and the Noteholders, and that pursuant to Section 2 hereof, the Depositor has transferred and assigned to the Issuer all rights and remedies under the Transfer Agreement and the Bluegreen Purchase Agreement.
		    			 				 (b)			The Transfer Agreement, the Bluegreen Purchase Agreement, and the other Transaction Documents contemplated thereby, are the only agreements pursuant to which the Depositor acquires ownership of the Timeshare Loans.  To the Knowledge of the Depositor, the representations and warranties of the Club Originator under the Transfer Agreement and the Bluegreen Purchase Agreement are true and correct.
		    			 				 (c)			In consideration of Sections 5(b) and (c) hereof, the Depositor hereby makes the representations and warranties relating to the Timeshare Loans contained in Schedule I hereto for the benefit of the Issuer and the Indenture Trustee for the benefit of the Noteholders as of the Closing Date (with respect to each Initial Timeshare Loan transferred on the Closing Date) and as of each Transfer Date (with respect to each Subsequent Timeshare Loan or Qualified Substitute Timeshare Loan transferred on such Transfer Date), as applicable.
		    			 				 (d)			It is understood and agreed that the representations and warranties set forth in this Section 5 shall survive the sale of each Timeshare Loan sold hereunder to the Issuer and any assignment of such Timeshare Loan by the Issuer to the Indenture Trustee on behalf of the Noteholders and shall continue so long as any such Timeshare Loans shall remain outstanding or until such time as such Timeshare Loans are repurchased, purchased or a Qualified Substitute Timeshare Loan is provided pursuant to Section 6 hereof.  The Depositor acknowledges that it has been advised that the Issuer intends to assign all of its right, title and interest in and to each Timeshare Loan sold hereunder and its rights and remedies under this Agreement to the Indenture Trustee on behalf of the Noteholders.  The Depositor agrees that, upon any such assignment, the Indenture Trustee may enforce directly, without joinder of the Issuer (but subject to any defense that the Depositor may have under this Agreement) all rights and remedies hereunder.
		    			 				 (e)			With respect to any representations and warranties contained in this Section 5 which are made to the Depositor's Knowledge, if it is discovered that any representation and warranty is inaccurate and such inaccuracy materially and adversely affects the value of a Timeshare Loan or the interests of the Issuer or any subsequent assignee thereof, then notwithstanding such lack of Knowledge of the accuracy of such representation and warranty at the time such representation or warranty was made (without regard to any Knowledge qualifiers), such inaccuracy shall be deemed a breach of such representation or warranty for purposes of the repurchase or substitution obligations described in Sections 6(a)(i) or (ii) hereof.

It is understood and agreed that the Depositor shall have the right and will enforce such right to require the Club Originator to repurchase or substitute a Defective Timeshare Loan in the event of a breach of any of the representations and warranties in Section 5 hereof which materially and adversely affects the value of a Timeshare Loan or the interests of the Issuer or any subsequent assignee of the Issuer (including the Indenture Trustee on behalf of the Noteholders) in accordance with the provisions of the Transfer Agreement and Bluegreen Purchase Agreement, as applicable.
		    			 				 (b)			Optional Purchases or Substitutions of Club Loans.  The Issuer hereby acknowledges that pursuant to the Transfer Agreement and the Bluegreen Purchase Agreement, the Depositor has irrevocably granted to the Club Originator an option to repurchase or substitute Original Club Loans it has thereunder and as described in the following sentence.  The Issuer acknowledges that with respect to any Original Club Loans for which the related Obligor has elected to effect and the Club Originator has agreed to effect an Upgrade, the Club Originator will (at its option) either (i) pay the Repurchase Price for such Original Club Loan or (ii) substitute one or more Qualified Substitute Timeshare Loans for such Original Club Loan and pay the related Substitution Shortfall Amounts, if any; provided,  however, that the Club Originator's option to substitute one or more Qualified Substitute Timeshare Loans for an Original Club Loan is limited on any date to (x) 12.5% of the Aggregate Closing Date Collateral Balance less (y) the aggregate Loan Balances of all Original Club Loans previously substituted by the Club Originator on prior Transfer Dates pursuant to this Agreement, the Transfer Agreement or the Bluegreen Purchase Agreement.  In addition, the Issuer acknowledges that the Club Originator shall use its best efforts to exercise its substitution option with respect to Original Club Loans prior to exercise of its repurchase option.  To the extent that the Club Originator shall elect to substitute Qualified Substitute Timeshare Loans for an Original Club Loan, the Club Originator shall use its best efforts to cause each such Qualified Substitute Timeshare Loan to be, in the following order of priority, (i) the Upgrade Club Loan related to such Original Club Loan and (ii) an Upgrade Club Loan unrelated to such Original Club Loan.
		    			 				 (c)			Optional Purchases or Substitutions of Defaulted Timeshare Loans.  The Issuer acknowledges that pursuant to the Transfer Agreement and the Bluegreen 				    		 			15

The Club Originator may irrevocably waive its option to purchase or substitute a Defaulted Timeshare Loan by delivering or causing to deliver to the Indenture Trustee a Waiver Letter in the form of Exhibit A attached hereto.
		    			 				 (d)			Payment of Repurchase Prices and Substitution Shortfall Amounts.  The Issuer hereby directs and the Depositor hereby agrees to remit or cause to be remitted all amounts in respect of Repurchase Prices and Substitution Shortfall Amounts payable during the related Due Period in immediately available funds to the Indenture Trustee to be deposited in the Collection Account on the Business Day immediately preceding the related Payment Date for such Due Period in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture.  In the event that more than one Timeshare Loan is replaced pursuant to Sections 6(a), (b) or (c) hereof on any Transfer Date, the Substitution Shortfall Amounts and the Loan Balances of Qualified Substitute Timeshare Loans shall be calculated on an aggregate basis for all substitutions made on such Transfer Date.

The Issuer and the Indenture Trustee shall cause the Custodian to release the related Timeshare Loan Files to the Depositor or its designee and the Servicer to release the related Timeshare Loan Servicing Files to the Depositor or its designee; provided,  however, that with respect to any Timeshare Loan File or Timeshare Loan Servicing File related to a Timeshare Loan that has been substituted by a Qualified Substitute Timeshare Loan, the Issuer and the Indenture Trustee shall not cause the Custodian and the Servicer to release the related Timeshare Loan File and the Timeshare Loan Servicing File, respectively, 				    		 			17

It is understood and agreed that the obligations of the Depositor contained in Section 6(a) hereof to cure a breach, or to repurchase or substitute Defective Timeshare Loans and the obligation of the Depositor to indemnify pursuant to Section 8 hereof , shall constitute the sole remedies available to the Issuer or its subsequent assignees for the breaches of any representation or warranty contained in Section 5 hereof and such remedies are not intended to and do not constitute "credit recourse"; to the Depositor.
		    			 				 SECTION 7.			Additional Covenants of the Depositor.  The Depositor hereby covenants and agrees with the Issuer as follows:
		    			 				 (a)			It shall comply with all laws, rules, regulations and orders applicable to it and its business and properties except where the failure to comply will not have a material adverse effect on its business or its ability to perform its obligations under this Agreement or any other Transaction Document to which it is a party or under the transactions contemplated hereunder or thereunder or the validity or enforceability of the Timeshare Loans.
		    			 				 (b)			It shall preserve and maintain its existence (corporate or otherwise), rights, franchises and privileges in the jurisdiction of its organization and except where the failure to so preserve and maintain will not have a material adverse effect on its business or its ability to perform its obligations under this Agreement or any other Transaction Document to which it is a party or under the transactions contemplated hereunder or thereunder or the validity or enforceability of the Timeshare Loans.
		    			 				 (c)			On the Closing Date and each Transfer Date, as applicable, it shall indicate in its and its Affiliates' computer files and other records that each Timeshare Loan has been sold to the Issuer.

		 hereunder or under any Timeshare Loan including, but not limited to, powers of attorney, UCC financing statements and assignments of mortgage.

A photocopy or other reproduction of this Agreement shall be sufficient as a financing statement where permitted by law.  The Issuer confirms that it is not its present intention to file a photocopy or other reproduction of this Agreement as a financing statement, but reserves the right to do so if, in its good faith determination, there is at such time no reasonable alternative remaining to it.
