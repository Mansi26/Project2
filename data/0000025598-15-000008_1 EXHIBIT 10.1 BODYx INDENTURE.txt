All things necessary have been done to make the Notes, when executed by the Issuer and authenticated and delivered by the Indenture Trustee hereunder and duly issued by the Issuer, the valid obligations of the Issuer, and to make this Indenture a valid agreement of the Issuer, in accordance with their and its terms. Simultaneously with the delivery of this Indenture, the Issuer is entering into the Sale and Servicing Agreement pursuant to which (a) the Depositor will convey to the Issuer all of its right, title and interest in, to and under the Loans and (b) the Servicer will agree to service the Loans and make collections thereon. GRANTING CLAUSES To secure the Issuer's obligations under the Notes, the Issuer hereby Grants to the Indenture Trustee, for the benefit of the Indenture Trustee and the Noteholders, all of the Issuer's right, title and interest, whether now owned or hereafter acquired, in, to and under the following: (i)   the Loans, whether now existing or hereafter acquired, and all rights to payment and amounts due or to become due with respect to all of the foregoing and the other Sold Assets; (ii)   all money, instruments, investment property and other property (together with all earnings, dividends, distributions, income, issues, and profits relating thereto) distributed or distributable in respect of the Loans; (iii)   the Note Accounts and all Eligible Investments and all money, investment property, instruments and other property from time to time on deposit in or credited to the Note Accounts, together with all earnings, dividends, distributions, income, issues and profits relating thereto; (iv)   all rights, remedies, powers, privileges and claims of the Issuer under or with respect to the Sale and Servicing Agreement, the Loan Purchase Agreement and each other Transaction Document (whether arising pursuant to the terms of the Sale and Servicing Agreement, the Loan Purchase Agreement or any other Transaction Document or otherwise available to the Issuer at law or in equity), including, without limitation, the rights of the Issuer to enforce the Sale and Servicing Agreement, the Loan Purchase Agreement or any other Transaction Document, and to give or withhold any and all consents, requests, notices, directions, approvals, extensions or waivers under or with respect to the Sale and Servicing Agreement, the Loan Purchase Agreement or any other Transaction Document to the same extent as the Issuer could but for the assignment and security interest granted hereunder; (v)   all proceeds of any credit insurance policies or collateral protection insurance policies relating to any Loans, to the extent of the applicable Seller's interest therein; (vi)   all accounts, chattel paper, deposit accounts, documents, general intangibles, goods, instruments, investment property, letter-of-credit rights, letters of credit, money, and oil, gas, and other minerals, consisting of, arising from, purporting to secure, or relating to, any of the foregoing; (vii)   all present and future claims, demands, causes and choses in action in respect of any or all of the foregoing and all payments on or under and all proceeds of every kind and nature whatsoever in respect of any or all of the foregoing, including all proceeds, products, rents, receipts or profits of the conversion, voluntary or involuntary, into cash or other property, all cash and non-cash proceeds, and other property consisting of, arising from or relating to all or any part of any of the foregoing or any proceeds thereof; and (viii)   all proceeds of the foregoing. The property described in the preceding sentence shall constitute the "Trust Estate"; provided, however, that the Trust Estate shall not include, and the lien of this Indenture shall not extend to, any assets or amounts released from the Lien of this Indenture in accordance with the express terms hereof. Such Grants are made in trust to secure the Notes equally and ratably without prejudice, priority or distinction between any Note and any other Notes of the same Class. The Indenture Trustee, as Indenture Trustee on behalf of the Noteholders, acknowledges such Grants, accepts the trusts hereunder in accordance with the provisions hereof. LIMITED RECOURSE The obligation of the Issuer to make payments of principal of and interest on the Notes are limited recourse obligations of the Issuer that are secured solely by and are payable solely from the related Trust Estate and only to the extent proceeds and distributions on such Trust Estate are allocated for their benefit under the terms of this Indenture. The holders of the Notes shall have no recourse to any other assets of the Issuer. In the event the Trust Estate has been exhausted and any of the Notes have not been paid in full, then any and all amounts that are still due on such Notes shall be extinguished and shall not revive, and such Notes shall be cancelled.          ARTICLE I Definitions SECTION 1.01    Definitions. Certain capitalized terms in this Indenture are defined in and shall have the respective meanings assigned to them in Part A of Schedule II (together with Part B of such Schedule II, the "Definitions Schedule") to the Sale and Servicing Agreement of even date herewith among Twenty-Second Street Funding LLC, as the Depositor, the Servicer and the Issuer. The rules of construction set forth in Part B of the Definitions Schedule shall be applicable to this Indenture.                   ARTICLE II The Notes SECTION 2.01    Form Generally. The Notes shall be designated as the "Springleaf Funding Trust 2015-A Notes." The Notes shall be in substantially the form attached as Exhibit A hereto.

The terms of the Notes set forth in Exhibit A to this Indenture are part of the terms of this Indenture.

At any time and from time to time after the execution and delivery of this Indenture, the Issuer may deliver Notes executed by the Issuer to the Indenture Trustee for authentication and delivery, and the Indenture Trustee, upon Issuer Order, shall authenticate and deliver such Notes as provided in this Indenture and not otherwise. No Note shall be entitled to any benefit under this Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose, unless there appears on such Note a certificate of authentication substantially in the form provided for herein executed by or on behalf of the Indenture Trustee by the manual signature of a duly authorized signatory, and such certificate upon any Note shall be conclusive evidence, and the only evidence, that such Note has been duly authenticated and delivered hereunder. SECTION 2.04    Book-Entry Notes. The Class A Notes, the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes and the Class D Notes upon original issuance, shall be issued in the form of one or more Notes representing the Book-Entry Notes, to be delivered to the Indenture Trustee as custodian for the Clearing Agency on behalf of the Issuer. The Class A Notes, the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes and the Class D Notes shall initially be registered on the Note Register in the name of the Clearing Agency of its nominee, and no Beneficial Owner will receive a Definitive Note representing such Beneficial Owner's interest in such Note, except as provided in Section 2.10. Unless and until Definitive Notes have been issued to the applicable Beneficial Owners pursuant to Section 2.10: (a)    the provisions of this Section 2.04 shall be in full force and effect; (b)    the Issuer, the Depositor, the Note Registrar and the Indenture Trustee shall be entitled to communicate directly with the Clearing Agency and the Clearing Agency Participants for all purposes of this Indenture (including distributions) as the authorized representatives of the Beneficial Owners of the Notes; (c)    to the extent that the provisions of this Section 2.04 conflict with any other provisions of this Indenture, the provisions of this Section 2.04 shall control; (d)    the rights of Beneficial Owners shall be exercised only through the Clearing Agency and the applicable Clearing Agency Participants and shall be limited to those established by law and agreements between such owners and the Clearing Agency and/or the Clearing Agency Participants. Unless and until Definitive Notes of such Class are issued pursuant to Section 2.10, the initial Clearing Agency shall make book-entry transfers among the Clearing Agency Participants and receive and transmit distributions of principal and interest on the related Notes to such Clearing Agency Participants and, without limiting the Issuer's or the Indenture Trustee's duties and obligations set forth elsewhere herein, neither the Issuer nor the Indenture Trustee shall have any responsibility therefor; and (e)    whenever this Indenture requires or permits actions to be taken based upon instructions or directions of Holders of Notes evidencing a specified percentage of the Aggregate Note Principal Balance, the Class A Note Balance or the Class B Note Balance, as applicable, the Clearing Agency shall be deemed to represent such percentage with respect to the Notes only to the extent that it has received instructions to such effect from Beneficial Owners and/or Clearing Agency Participants owning or representing, respectively, such required percentage of the beneficial interest in such Notes and has delivered such instructions to the Indenture Trustee. For the avoidance of doubt, irrespective of whether such Clearing Agency has received such instructions, the determination as to whether such Clearing Agency has received such instructions, the determination as to whether any Note is "Outstanding" shall be made in accordance with the definition thereof. None of the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee or the Note Registrar shall have any liability for any aspect of the records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests in the Book-Entry Notes or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to beneficial ownership interests or transfers thereof. Except as provided in the next succeeding paragraph of this Section 2.04, the rights of Beneficial Owners with respect to the Book-Entry Notes shall be limited to those established by law and agreements between such Beneficial Owners and the Clearing Agency and Clearing Agency Participants. Except as provided in Section 2.10 hereof, Beneficial Owners shall not be entitled to Definitive Notes in exchange for the Book-Entry Notes as to which they are the Beneficial Owners. Requests and directions from, and votes of, the Clearing Agency as Holder of the Notes shall not be deemed inconsistent if they are made with respect to different Beneficial Owners. The Indenture Trustee may establish a reasonable record date in connection with solicitations of consents from or voting by Noteholders and give notice to the Clearing Agency of such record date. Other than pursuant to Section 2.10, without the consent of the Issuer and the Indenture Trustee, no Book-Entry Note may be transferred by the Clearing Agency except to a successor Clearing Agency that agrees to hold such Note for the account of the Beneficial Owners. The Depository Trust Company shall be the initial Clearing Agency. In the event that The Depository Trust Company resigns or is removed as Clearing Agency, the Indenture Trustee may designate a successor Clearing Agency. If no successor Clearing Agency has been designated within thirty (30) days of the effective date of the Clearing Agency's resignation or removal, each Beneficial Owner shall be entitled to Definitive Notes representing the Notes it beneficially owns in the manner prescribed in Section 2.10. SECTION 2.05    Registration of and Limitations on Transfer and Exchange of Notes; Appointment of Note Registrar. (a)    The Indenture Trustee shall act as, or shall appoint, a note registrar (in such capacity, the "Note Registrar") that shall provide for the registration of Notes, and transfers and exchanges of Notes as herein provided. The Note Registrar shall initially be the Indenture Trustee and any co-note registrar chosen by the Indenture Trustee and acceptable to the Issuer. The Note Registrar shall keep a register (the "Note Register") in which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, the registration of Notes and the registration of transfers of Notes shall be provided. The Note Registrar shall act solely for the purpose of maintaining the Note Register as an agent of the Issuer. Any transfer of an interest in a Definitive Note shall be reflected in the Note Register and entries in the Note Register shall be presumed correct. The Issuer hereby has the right to examine the Note Register at any time upon reasonable notice to the Note Registrar. Any reference in this Indenture to the Note Registrar shall include any co-note registrar unless the context requires otherwise. The Indenture Trustee may revoke such appointment and remove any Note Registrar if the Indenture Trustee determines in its sole discretion that such Note Registrar failed to perform its obligations under this Indenture in any material respect. Any Note Registrar shall be permitted to resign as Note Registrar upon thirty (30) days written notice to the Issuer and the Indenture Trustee; provided, however, that such resignation shall not be effective and such Note Registrar shall continue to perform its duties as Note Registrar until the Indenture Trustee has appointed a successor Note Registrar (which may be the Indenture Trustee) reasonably acceptable to the Issuer. (b)    No transfer, sale, pledge or other disposition of any Note or interest therein shall be made unless that transfer, sale, pledge or other disposition is exempt from the registration and/or qualification requirements of the Securities Act and any applicable state securities laws, or is otherwise made in accordance with the Securities Act and such state securities laws. None of the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee or the Note Registrar is obligated to register or qualify any Notes under the Securities Act or any other securities law or to take any action not otherwise required under this Indenture to permit the transfer of any Note or interest therein without registration or qualification. Any Noteholder desiring to effect a transfer of Notes or interests therein shall, and does hereby agree to, indemnify the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee and the Note Registrar against any liability that may result if the transfer is not so exempt or is not made in accordance with such federal and state laws. Any attempted transfer, sale, pledge or other disposition of any Note or interest therein in contravention of this Section 2.05 will be void ab initio and the purported transferor will continue to be treated as the owner of the Notes for all purposes. (c)    The Notes are being offered and sold by the Initial Purchasers only to QIBs in transactions meeting the requirements of Rule 144A or, in the case of the Class A and Class B Notes only, to persons (other than "UxxPDSxxPD persons" as defined in Regulation S) outside the United States pursuant to the requirements of Regulation S. The Class C Notes and Class D Notes may not be sold outside the United State in reliance on Regulation S. If it is acquiring any Class A Notes or Class B Notes or any interest or participation therein in an "offshore transaction" (as defined to Regulation S), the purchaser is deemed to acknowledge that those notes will initially be represented by a temporary global note with the applicable legends set forth in Exhibit A (the "Temporary Regulation S Global Note") in fully-registered form without interest coupons and that transfers thereof or any interest or participation therein are restricted as set forth in this Section 2.05.  The Class A Notes and Class B Notes that are not sold in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S and the Class C Notes and the Class D Notes shall initially be issued in the form of one or more permanent global notes with the applicable legends set forth in Exhibit A (each, a "Rule 144A Global Note") in fully-registered form without interest coupons. The principal amount of a Global Note may from time to time be increased or decreased by adjustments made on the records of the custodian for DTC, DTC's nominee or any other authorized person, to reflect the transfers of interest described in this Section or other transactions under this Indenture. Any ownership interest represented by a beneficial interest in a Rule 144A Global Note may be transferred to another entity who wishes to hold Series 2015-A Notes in the form of an interest in a Rule 144A Global Note; provided, that, the applicable transferor and transferee are deemed to have represented and warranted that such transfer is being made to a transferee that the transferor reasonably believes is a QIB in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A. Through and including the fortieth day after the later of the commencement of the offering of the Notes (which shall not include Class C Notes or Class D Notes) to persons other than distributors in reliance upon Regulation S and the Closing Date (that period through and including that fortieth day, the "Distribution Compliance Period"), any ownership interest represented by a beneficial interest in the Temporary Regulation S Global Note may be transferred to a person who wishes to hold Notes in the form of an interest in the Temporary Regulation S Global Note; provided, that, the applicable transferee is deemed to have represented and warranted that it is not a "UxxPDSxxPD person" (as defined in Regulation S) and such transfer is being made in accordance with Rule 903 or Rule 904 of Regulation S and all other applicable securities laws. All distributions in respect of Notes represented by a Temporary Regulation S Global Note will be made only with respect to that portion of the Temporary Regulation S Global Note in respect of which Euroclear or Clearstream shall have delivered to the Indenture Trustee a certificate or certificates substantially in the form of Exhibit B-4. The delivery to the Indenture Trustee by Euroclear or Clearstream of a certificate or certificates referred to above may be relied upon by the Issuer and the Indenture Trustee as conclusive evidence that the certificate or certificates referred to therein has or have been delivered to Euroclear or Clearstream pursuant to the terms of this Indenture and the Temporary Regulation S Global Note. Transfers of an interest in a Regulation S Global Note for an interest in a Rule 144A Global Note, and vice versa (except that no interest in a Class C Note or Class D Note may be transferred for an interest in a Regulation S Global Note), may be made at any time; provided that the intended transferor and transferee are each able to represent and warrant that such transferee satisfies the conditions set forth above to hold a beneficial interest in the applicable Global Note and the transferor provides a transfer certificate in the form of Exhibit B-1, Exhibit B-2 or Exhibit B-3, as applicable. Any interest in the Notes represented by an interest in a Rule 144A Global Note that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of an interest in a Regulation S Global Note, and vice versa, will, upon transfer, cease to be an interest in such original Rule 144A Global Note or Regulation S Global Note, as the case may be, and become an interest in a Regulation S Global Note or a Rule 144A Global Note, as applicable, and accordingly, will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions and other procedures applicable to an interest in the applicable form of Global Note. Interests in a Temporary Regulation S Global Note as to which the Indenture Trustee has received from Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, a certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit B-4 to the effect that Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, has received a certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit B-5 from the holder of a beneficial interest in such Note, will be exchanged on and after the last day of the Distribution Compliance Period for interests in a permanent global note with the applicable legends set forth in Exhibit A (a "Permanent Regulation S Global Note" and, together with the Temporary Regulation S Global Note, the "Regulation S Global Notes") in fully-registered form without interest coupons. The delivery of the certificate or certificates referred to above to the Indenture Trustee by Euroclear or Clearstream may be relied upon by the Issuer and the Indenture Trustee as conclusive evidence that the certificate or certificates referred to therein has or have been delivered to Euroclear or Clearstream pursuant to the terms of this Indenture and the Temporary Regulation S Global Note. In the event that a Rule 144A Global Note is exchanged for one or more Definitive Notes (a "Rule 144A Definitive Note") or a Regulation S Global Note is exchanged for one or more Definitive Notes (a "Regulation S Definitive Note") pursuant to Section 2.10 of this Indenture, the related Beneficial Owner shall be required to deliver a representation letter with respect to the matters described in this Section 2.05. Such Rule 144A Definitive Notes and Regulation S Definitive Notes may be exchanged for one another only upon delivery of a representation letter with respect to the matters described in Section 2.05 and in accordance with such procedures as are substantially consistent with the provisions above (including certification requirements intended to insure that such transfers comply with Rule 144A or, other than in the case of Class C Notes and Class D Notes, are to Persons who are not "UxxPDSxxPD persons" (as defined in Regulation S), or otherwise comply with Regulation S, as the case may be) and as may be from time to time adopted by the Issuer and the Indenture Trustee. The Indenture Trustee shall destroy the applicable Global Note upon its exchange in full for Definitive Notes. Each purchaser of a Note that represents a beneficial interest in a Global Note will be deemed to have represented and agreed, and each purchaser of a Definitive Note will be required to certify to the Indenture Trustee and Note Registrar in writing that: (i)    (1) the purchaser is a QIB and is acquiring such Notes for its own account or as a fiduciary or agent for others (which others are also QIBs) for investment purposes and not for distribution in violation of the Securities Act, and it is able to bear the economic risk of an investment in the Notes and has such knowledge and experience in financial and business matters so as to be capable of evaluating the merits and

resale pursuant to Rule 144A, to a person who the seller reasonably believes is a QIB acquiring the Notes for its own account or as a fiduciary or agent for others (which others must also be QIBs) to whom notice is given that the resale or other transfer is being made in reliance on Rule 144A, or, if applicable and solely in the case of Class A Notes and Class B Notes, (2) to a purchaser who is

In addition, with respect to the sale of a Later-Sold Note that is a Class A Note or Class B Note, such sale will not be effective unless the Issuer receives an Opinion of Counsel that such Class A Note or Class B Note will be characterized as indebtedness for UxxPDSxxPD federal income tax purposes, and with respect to the sale of a Later-Sold Note that is a Class C Note or a Class D Note, such sale will not be effective unless the Issuer receives an Opinion of Counsel that such Class C Note or Class D Note should be characterized as indebtedness for UxxPDSxxPD federal income tax purposes. Finally, to the extent that the Later-Sold Note is a Class C Note or Class D Note, such sale will not be effective unless the requirements of Section 2.05 are satisfied prior to such sale. SECTION 3.15    Notice of Events of Default. The Issuer agrees to give the Indenture Trustee, each Noteholder and each Rating Agency prompt written notice of each Event of Default hereunder and each default on the part of any party thereto of its obligations under the Loan Purchase Agreement. The Issuer shall deliver to the Indenture Trustee, within five (5) days after the occurrence of any Default or Insolvency Event with respect to the Issuer, written notice in the form of an Officer's Certificate of the Issuer of such Default or Insolvency Event, its status and what action the Issuer is taking or proposes to take with respect thereto. SECTION 3.16    No Other Business. The Issuer shall not engage in any business other than the purpose and powers set forth in Section 2.02 of the Trust Agreement and all activities incidental thereto. SECTION 3.17    Further Instruments and Acts. Upon written request of the Indenture Trustee, the Issuer will execute and deliver such further instruments and do such further acts as may be reasonably necessary or proper to carry out more effectively the purpose of this Indenture. SECTION 3.18    Maintenance of Separate Existence. The Issuer agrees to comply with the separateness covenants in Section 5.09 of the Trust Agreement. SECTION 3.19    Perfection Representations, Warranties and Covenants. The perfection representations, warranties and covenants attached hereto as Schedule I shall be deemed to be part of this Indenture for all purposes. SECTION 3.20    Other Representations of the Issuer. On the Closing Date, the Issuer makes the following representations and warranties for the benefit of the Noteholders: (a)    Binding Obligation.

Rescission and Annulment. (a)    If an Event of Default described in clauses (b) through (i) of Section 5.02 shall have occurred and be continuing, then in every such case the Indenture Trustee, at the direction of the Required Noteholders, shall declare all the Notes to be immediately due and payable, by a notice in writing to the Issuer, and upon any such declaration the unpaid principal amount of the Notes, together with accrued or accreted and unpaid interest thereon through the date of acceleration, shall become immediately due and payable. (b)    If an Event of Default described in clause (a) of Section 5.02 shall have occurred and be continuing, then the unpaid principal of all Notes, together with the accrued or accreted and unpaid interest thereon through the date of acceleration, shall automatically become, and shall be considered to be declared, due and payable. (c)    At any time after such declaration of acceleration of maturity has been made and before a judgment or decree for payment of the money due has been obtained by the Indenture Trustee as hereinafter in this Article V provided, the Required Noteholders, by written notice to the Issuer and the Indenture Trustee, may rescind and annul such declaration and its consequences if: (i)    the Issuer has paid or deposited with the Indenture Trustee a sum sufficient to pay: (A)    all payments of principal of and interest on the Notes and all other amounts that would then be due hereunder or upon the Notes if the Event of Default giving rise to such acceleration had not occurred;

Priorities. (a)    If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, and the Notes have been accelerated under Section 5.03, the Indenture Trustee shall, upon the written direction of the Required Noteholders (subject to Section 5.06), do one or more of the following: (i)    institute Proceedings in its own name and as trustee of an express trust for the collection of all amounts then payable on the Notes or under this Indenture with respect thereto, whether by declaration of acceleration or otherwise, enforce any judgment obtained, and collect from the Issuer the Trust Estate and from any other obligor upon such Notes monies adjudged due; (ii)    sell, on a servicing released basis, Loans, as shall constitute a part of the related Trust Estate (or rights or interest therein), at one or more public or private sales called and conducted in any manner permitted by law; (iii)    direct the Issuer to exercise rights, remedies, powers, privileges or claims under the Sale and Servicing Agreement, the Loan Purchase Agreement and the Performance Support Agreement pursuant to Section 5.18 hereof; and (iv)    take any other appropriate action to protect and enforce the rights and remedies of the Indenture Trustee or the Noteholders hereunder; provided, however, that the Indenture Trustee may not exercise the remedy in subparagraph (ii) above or otherwise sell or liquidate the Trust Estate substantially as a whole (in one or more sales), or institute Proceedings in furtherance thereof, unless (A) the Holders of 100% of the aggregate unpaid principal amount of the Outstanding Notes direct such remedy, (B) the Indenture Trustee determines that the anticipated proceeds of such sale distributable to the Noteholders are sufficient to discharge in full all amounts then due and unpaid upon the Notes for principal and interest (after giving effect to the payment of any amounts that are senior in priority to such principal and interest) or (C) the Indenture Trustee determines (based on the information provided to it by the Servicer) that the Trust Estate may not continue to provide sufficient funds for the payment of principal of and interest on the Notes as they would have become due if the Notes had not been declared due and payable, and the Indenture Trustee is directed to take such remedy by the Holders of not less than 66 2/3% of the aggregate unpaid principal amount of the Outstanding Notes. In determining such sufficiency or insufficiency with respect to clauses (B) and (C), the Indenture Trustee may, but need not, obtain and rely upon an opinion of an Independent investment banking or accounting firm of national reputation as to the feasibility of such proposed action and as to the sufficiency of the Trust Estate for such purpose. The cost of such opinion shall be reimbursed to the Indenture Trustee from amounts held in the Collection Account in accordance with Section 8.06. The remedies provided in this Section 5.05(a) are the exclusive remedies provided to the Noteholders with respect to the Trust Estate and each of the Noteholders (by their acceptance of their respective interests in the Notes) and the Indenture Trustee hereby expressly waive any other remedy that might have been available under the applicable UCC. (b)    If the Indenture Trustee collects any money or property pursuant to this Article V following the acceleration of the maturities of the Notes pursuant to Section 5.03 (so long as such declaration shall not have been rescinded or annulled), it shall pay out the money or property in accordance with Section 8.06 hereof or, in the case of an acceleration as a result of an Event of Default described in clause (a) of Section 5.02, as may otherwise be directed by a court of competent jurisdiction. (c)    Following the sale of the Trust Estate and the application of the proceeds of such sale and other amounts, if any, then held in the Collection Account in accordance with Section 8.06 hereof, any and all amounts remaining due on the Notes and all other Obligations shall be extinguished and shall not revive, the Notes shall be cancelled, and the Notes shall no longer be Outstanding. (d)    The Indenture Trustee may fix a record date and Payment Date for any payment to Noteholders pursuant to this Section.

provided, however, that, subject to Section 6.01 and Section 6.03(d): (a)    the Indenture Trustee shall have the right to decline any such direction if the Indenture Trustee, after being advised by counsel, determines that the action so directed is in conflict with any applicable Requirements of Law or with this Indenture; and (b)    the Indenture Trustee shall have the right to decline any such direction with respect to such Proceeding if the Indenture Trustee in good faith shall determine that the Proceedings so directed would be illegal or involve the Indenture Trustee in liability for which it has not been indemnified in accordance with Article VI or be unjustly prejudicial to the Noteholders not parties to such direction. SECTION 5.13    Waiver of Past Defaults. The Required Noteholders may, on behalf of all Noteholders, waive in writing any past default with respect to the Notes and its consequences (including an Event of Default), except that: (a)    a default in the payment of the principal or interest in respect of any Note cannot be waived without the consent of each Noteholder of each Outstanding Note affected thereby; (b)    a default as a result of an Insolvency Event with respect to the Issuer or the Depositor cannot be waived without the consent of each Noteholder; (c)    a default in respect of a covenant or provision hereof that under Section 9.02 hereof cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the Noteholder of each Outstanding Note or each Noteholder of each Outstanding Note affected thereby cannot be waived without the consent of each such Noteholder;

Any failure of the Indenture Trustee to mail such notice, or any defect therein, shall not, however, in any way impair or affect the validity of any such supplemental indenture. SECTION 9.03    Execution of Supplemental Indentures. In executing any supplemental indenture permitted by this Article IX or the modification thereby of the trusts created by this Indenture, the Indenture Trustee shall be entitled to receive, and subject to Sections 6.01 and 6.02, shall be fully protected in relying upon, an Opinion of Counsel stating that the execution of such supplemental indenture is authorized or permitted by this Indenture. The Indenture Trustee may, but shall not be obligated to, enter into any supplemental indenture that affects its (as such or in its individual capacity) own rights, duties, liabilities, benefits, protections, privileges or immunities under this Indenture or otherwise. SECTION 9.04    Effect of Supplemental Indenture. Upon the execution of any supplemental indenture under this Article IX, this Indenture shall be modified and amended in accordance therewith with respect to the Notes affected thereby, and the respective rights, limitations of rights, obligations, duties, liabilities and immunities under this Indenture of the Indenture Trustee, the Issuer, the Servicer and the Holders of the Notes shall thereafter be determined, exercised and enforced hereunder subject in all respects to such modifications and amendments, and the terms and conditions of any such supplemental indenture shall be deemed to be a part of this Indenture for any and all purposes. SECTION 9.05    Reference in Notes to Supplemental Indentures. Notes authenticated and delivered after the execution of any supplemental indenture pursuant to this Article IX may, and if required by the Issuer or the Indenture Trustee shall, bear a notation in form approved by the Indenture Trustee as to any matter provided for in such supplemental indenture. If the Issuer shall so determine, new Notes so modified as to conform, in the opinion of the Indenture Trustee and the Issuer, to any such supplemental indenture may be prepared and executed by the Issuer and authenticated and delivered by the Indenture Trustee in exchange for the Outstanding Notes. SECTION 9.06    Modification of Obligations of Owner Trustee. Notwithstanding anything in this Article IX to the contrary, no amendment may be made to this Indenture that would adversely affect the rights, indemnities, immunities, liabilities or duties of the Owner Trustee without the written consent of the Owner Trustee.          ARTICLE X Termination SECTION 10.01    Termination of Indenture. The respective obligations and responsibilities of the Issuer, the Servicer and the Indenture Trustee created hereby (other than those which by their terms survive) shall terminate upon payment in full of all Outstanding Notes and the satisfaction in full of all other obligations of the Issuer, the Servicer and the Indenture Trustee pursuant to this Indenture. SECTION 10.02    Final Distribution. (a)    The Servicer shall give the Indenture Trustee at least fifteen (15) days prior written notice of the Payment Date on which the Noteholders may surrender their Notes for payment of the final distribution on and cancellation of such Notes. Such notice shall be accompanied by an Officer's Certificate of the Servicer setting forth the information specified in Section 3.07 of the Sale and Servicing Agreement covering the period during the then-current calendar year through the date of such notice. To the extent practicable, not later than five (5) Business Days prior to such final Payment Date, the Indenture Trustee shall provide notice to Noteholders specifying (i) the date upon which final payment of the Notes will be made upon presentation and surrender of such Notes at the office or offices therein designated, (ii) the amount of any such final payment and (iii) that the Record Date otherwise applicable to such Payment Date is not applicable, payments being made only upon presentation and surrender of such Notes at the office or offices therein specified. The Indenture Trustee shall give such notice to the Note Registrar (if other than the Indenture Trustee) at the time such notice is given to Noteholders. (b)    Notwithstanding a final distribution to the Noteholders (or the termination of the Issuer), except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, all funds then on deposit in the Collection Account, shall continue to be held in trust for the benefit of such Noteholders and the Indenture Trustee shall pay such funds to such Noteholders upon surrender of their Notes. In the event that all such Noteholders shall not surrender their Notes for cancellation within six (6) months after the date specified in the notice from the Indenture Trustee described in paragraph (a), the Indenture Trustee shall give a second notice to the remaining such Noteholders to surrender their Notes for cancellation and receive the final distribution with respect thereto. If within one (1) year after the second notice all such Notes shall not have been surrendered for cancellation, the Indenture Trustee may take appropriate steps, or may appoint an agent to take appropriate steps, to contact the remaining such Noteholders concerning surrender of their Notes pursuant to and as described in Section 3.03. The Indenture Trustee shall pay to the Issuer any monies held by them for the payment of principal or interest that remains unclaimed for two (2) years pursuant to and as described in Section 3.03. After payment to the Issuer, Noteholders entitled to the money must look to the Issuer for payment as general creditors unless an applicable abandoned property law designates another Person.               ARTICLE XI Miscellaneous SECTION 11.01    Compliance Certificates. Upon any application or request by the Issuer to the Indenture Trustee to take any action under any provision of this Indenture, the Issuer shall furnish to the Indenture Trustee an Officer's Certificate of the Issuer stating that all conditions precedent, if any, provided for in this Indenture relating to the proposed action have been complied with. Every certificate with respect to compliance with a condition or covenant provided for in this Indenture shall include: (i)    a statement that each signatory of such certificate has read or has caused to be read such covenant or condition and the definitions herein relating thereto; (ii)    a brief statement as to the nature and scope of the examination or investigation upon which the statements contained in such certificate are based; (iii)    a statement that, in the opinion of each such signatory, such signatory has made such examination or investigation as is necessary to enable such signatory to express an informed opinion as to whether or not such covenant or condition has been complied with; and (iv)    a statement as to whether, in the opinion of each such signatory, such condition or covenant has been complied with. SECTION 11.02    Form of Documents Delivered to Indenture Trustee. In any case where several matters are required to be certified by, or covered by an opinion of, any specified Person, it is not necessary that all such matters be certified by, or covered by the opinion of, only one such Person, or that they be so certified or covered by only one document, but one such Person may certify or give an opinion with respect to some matters and one or more other such Persons as to other matters, and any such Person may certify or give an opinion as to such matters in one or several documents. Any certificate or opinion of an Authorized Officer of the Issuer may be based, insofar as it relates to legal matters, upon a certificate or opinion of, or representations by, counsel, unless such Authorized Officer knows, or in the exercise of reasonable care should know, that the certificate or opinion or representations with respect to the matters upon which such Authorized Officer's certificate or opinion is based are erroneous. Any such certificate of an Authorized Officer or Opinion of Counsel may be based, insofar as it relates to factual matters, upon a certificate or opinion of, or representations by, an officer or officers of the Servicer, the Depositor, the Issuer or the Administrator, stating that the information with respect to such factual matters is in the possession of the Servicer, the Depositor, the Issuer or the Administrator, unless such Authorized Officer or counsel knows, or in the exercise of reasonable care should know, that the certificate or opinion or representations with respect to such matters are erroneous. Where any Person is required to make, give or execute two (2) or more applications, requests, consents, certificates, statements, opinions or other instruments under this Indenture, they may, but need not, be consolidated and form one instrument. SECTION 11.03    Acts of Noteholders. (a)    Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action provided by this Indenture to be given or taken by Noteholders may be embodied in and evidenced by one or more instruments of substantially similar tenor signed by such Noteholders in person or by an agent duly appointed in writing and satisfying any requisite percentages as to minimum number or Dollar value of aggregate unpaid principal amount represented by such Noteholders; and, except as herein otherwise expressly provided, such action shall become effective when such instrument or instruments are delivered to the Indenture Trustee, and, where it is hereby expressly required, to the Issuer. Such instrument or instruments (and the action embodied therein and evidenced thereby) are herein sometimes referred to as the "Act" of the Noteholders signing such instrument or instruments. Proof of execution of any such instrument or of a writing appointing any such agent shall be sufficient for any purpose of this Indenture and conclusive in favor of the Indenture Trustee and the Issuer, if made in the manner provided in this Section 11.03. (b)    The fact and date of the execution by any Person of any such instrument or writing may be proved in any manner which the Indenture Trustee deems sufficient. (c)    The ownership of Notes shall be proved by the Note Register. (d)    Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action by the Holder of any Notes shall bind the Holder (and any transferee thereof) of every Note issued upon the registration thereof, in exchange therefor or in lieu thereof, in respect of anything done, omitted or suffered to be done by the Indenture Trustee or the Issuer in reliance thereon, whether or not notation of such action is made upon such Note. SECTION 11.04    Notices, Etc. Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or Act of Noteholders or other documents provided or permitted by the Indenture to be in writing and shall be made upon, given or furnished to, or filed with: (a)    the Indenture Trustee shall be sufficient for every purpose hereunder if made, given, furnished or filed in writing to a Responsible Officer, by facsimile transmission or by other means acceptable to the Indenture Trustee to or with the Indenture Trustee at its Corporate Trust Office; or (b)    the Issuer shall be sufficient for every purpose hereunder if in writing and mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to the Issuer addressed to it at Springleaf Funding Trust 2015-A, c/o Wilmington Trust, National Association, Rodney Square North, 1100 North Market Street, Wilmington, Delaware 19890, Attention: Corporate Trust Department, Facsimile No.: (302) 636-4140, with a copy to the Administrator at Springleaf Finance Corporation, 601 NW Second Street, Evansville Indiana 47708, Attention: General Counsel, Facsimile: (812) 468-5396, or at any other address previously furnished in writing to the Indenture Trustee by the Issuer. The Issuer shall promptly transmit any notice received by it from the Noteholders to the Indenture Trustee. SECTION 11.05    Notices to Noteholders; Waiver. Where this Indenture provides for notice to Noteholders of any event, such notice shall be sufficiently given (unless otherwise herein expressly provided), if in writing and mailed by first-class mail postage prepaid or national overnight courier service to each Noteholder affected by such event, at its address as it appears on the Note Register, not later than the latest date, and not earlier than the earliest date, prescribed for the giving of such notice. In any case where notice to Noteholders is given by mail, neither the failure to mail such notice, nor any defect in any notice so mailed, to any particular Noteholder shall affect the sufficiency of such notice with respect to other Noteholders and any notice which is mailed in the manner herein provided shall conclusively be presumed to have been duly given. Where this Indenture provides for notice in any manner, such notice may be waived in writing by any Person entitled to receive such notice, either before or after the event, and such waiver shall be the equivalent of such notice. Waivers of notice by Noteholders shall be filed with the Indenture Trustee but such filing shall not be a condition precedent to the validity of any action taken in reliance upon such waiver. In the event that, by reason of the suspension of regular mail service, it shall be impractical to mail notice of any event to Noteholders when such notice is required to be given pursuant to any provision of this Indenture, then any manner of giving such notice as shall be satisfactory to the Indenture Trustee shall be deemed to be a sufficient giving of such notice. Where this Indenture provides for notice to the Rating Agencies, failure to give such notice shall not affect any other rights or obligations created hereunder and shall not under any circumstances constitute a Default, an Event of Default or an Early Amortization Event. SECTION 11.06    Effect of Headings and Table of Contents. The Article and Section headings herein and the Table of Contents are for convenience only and shall not affect the construction hereof. SECTION 11.07    Successors and Assigns. All covenants and agreements in this Indenture by the Issuer and the Servicer shall bind their respective successors and assigns, whether so expressed or not. All covenants and agreements of the Indenture Trustee in this Indenture shall bind its successors and assigns. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no party hereto may assign its rights or obligations under this Indenture without the prior written consent of each other party hereto. SECTION 11.08    Separability. In case any provision in this Indenture or in the Notes shall be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the validity, legality, and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby. SECTION 11.09    Benefits of Indenture. Nothing in this Indenture or in the Notes, express or implied, shall give to any Person, other than the parties hereto, the Owner Trustee, the Noteholders, and their respective successors hereunder, any benefit or any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under this Indenture. The Owner Trustee is a third-party beneficiary to this Indenture and is entitled to the rights and benefits hereunder and may enforce the provisions hereof as if it were a party hereto. SECTION 11.10    Legal Holidays. In any case where the date on which any payment is due shall not be a Business Day, then (notwithstanding any other provision of the Notes or this Indenture) payment need not be made on such date, but may be made on the next succeeding Business Day with the same force and effect as if made on the date on which nominally due. SECTION 11.11    Governing Law. (a)    THIS INDENTURE SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK APPLICABLE TO AGREEMENTS MADE AND TO BE PERFORMED THEREIN WITHOUT REFERENCE TO ITS CONFLICT OF LAWS PROVISIONS (OTHER THAN SECTION 5-1401 OF THE GENERAL OBLIGATIONS LAW). (b)    Regardless of any provision in any other agreement, for purposes of the UCC, the State of New York shall be deemed to be the "bank's jurisdiction" (within the meaning of Section 9-304 of the UCC) and the "securities intermediary's jurisdiction" (within the meaning of Section 8-110 of the UCC). SECTION 11.12    Counterparts. This Indenture may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which so executed shall be deemed to be an original, but all such counterparts shall together constitute but one and the same instrument. SECTION 11.13    Recording of Indenture. If this Indenture is subject to recording in any appropriate public recording offices, such recording is to be effected by the Issuer and at its expense accompanied by an Opinion of Counsel (which shall be counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indenture Trustee) to the effect that such recording is necessary either for the protection of the Noteholders or any other Person secured hereunder or for the enforcement of any right or remedy granted to the Indenture Trustee under this Indenture. SECTION 11.14    Inspection. The Issuer agrees that, on reasonable prior notice, it will permit any representative of the Indenture Trustee, during the Issuer's normal business hours, to examine all the books of account, records, reports, and other papers of the Issuer, to make copies and extracts therefrom, to cause such books to be audited by Independent certified public accountants, and to discuss the Issuer's affairs, finances and accounts with the Issuer's officers, employees, and Independent certified public accountants, all at such reasonable times and as often as may be reasonably requested. The Indenture Trustee shall, and shall cause its representatives, to hold in confidence all such information except to the extent disclosure may be required by law (and all reasonable applications for confidential treatment are unavailing) and except to the extent that the Indenture Trustee may reasonably determine that such disclosure is consistent with its obligations hereunder or is required by the UCC. SECTION 11.15    Trust Obligation. No recourse may be taken, directly or indirectly, with respect to the obligations of the Issuer, the Owner Trustee or the Indenture Trustee on the Notes or under this Indenture or any certificate or other writing delivered in connection herewith or therewith, against (i) the Indenture Trustee or the Owner Trustee in their respective individual capacities, (ii) any owner of a beneficial interest in the Issuer or (iii) any partner, owner, beneficiary, agent, officer, director, employee or agent of the Indenture Trustee or the Owner Trustee in their individual capacities, any holder of a beneficial interest in the Issuer, the Owner Trustee or the Indenture Trustee or of any successor or assign of the Indenture Trustee or the Owner Trustee in their individual capacities. SECTION 11.16    Limitation of Liability of Owner Trustee. It is expressly understood and agreed by the parties hereto that (a) this Indenture is executed and delivered by Wilmington Trust, National Association, not individually or personally but solely as owner trustee of the Issuer, in the exercise of the powers and authority conferred and vested in it under the Trust Agreement, (b) each of the representations, undertakings and agreements herein made on the part of the Issuer is made and intended not as personal representations, undertakings and agreements by Wilmington Trust, National Association but is made and intended for the purpose of binding only the Issuer, (c) nothing herein contained shall be construed as creating any liability on Wilmington Trust, National Association, individually or personally, to perform any covenants, either expressed or implied, contained herein, all personal liability, if any, being expressly waived by the parties hereto and by any person claiming by, through or under the parties hereto, (d) Wilmington Trust, National Association has made no investigation as to the accuracy or completeness of any representations or warranties made by the Issuer in this Indenture and (e) under no circumstances shall Wilmington Trust, National Association be personally liable for the payment of any indebtedness or expenses of the Issuer or be liable for the breach or failure of any obligation, representation, warranty or covenant made or undertaken by the Issuer under this Indenture or the other Transaction Documents to which the Issuer is a party. SECTION 11.17    No Bankruptcy Petition; Disclaimer and Subordination. (a)    Each of the Servicer, the Indenture Trustee and each Noteholder and the holders of the Trust Certificates (by acceptance of the applicable Notes or Trust Certificates) covenants and agrees that it will not institute against the Depositor, or the Issuer, or solicit or join in or cooperate with or encourage any other Person in instituting against the Depositor or the Issuer, any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency or liquidation proceedings or other similar proceedings under the laws of the United States of America or any state of the United States of America.
