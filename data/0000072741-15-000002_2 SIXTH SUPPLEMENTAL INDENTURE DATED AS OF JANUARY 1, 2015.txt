Definitions Applicable to Redemption Provisions. As used in this Article Four: "Adjusted Treasury Rate" means, with respect to any redemption date, (i) the yield, under the heading which represents the average for the immediately preceding week, appearing in the most recently published statistical release designated "H.15 (519)" or any successor publication which is published weekly by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and which establishes yields on actively traded United States Treasury securities adjusted to constant maturity under the caption "Treasury Constant Maturities," for the maturity corresponding to the Comparable Treasury Issue (defined below) (if no maturity is within three months before or after the remaining term from the redemption date to the stated maturity of the 2018 Notes, in the case of the 2018 Notes, or the Par Call Date, in the case of the 2025 Notes, then yields for the two published maturities most closely corresponding to the Comparable Treasury Issue shall be determined and the Adjusted Treasury Rate shall be interpolated or extrapolated from such yields on a straight line basis, rounding to the nearest month) or (ii) if such release (or any successor release) is not published during the week preceding the calculation date or does not contain such yields, the rate per year equal to the semi-annual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue assuming a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such redemption date, in each case calculated on the third business day preceding the redemption date, plus 12.5 basis points in respect of the 2018 Notes or 20 basis points in respect of the 2025 Notes. "Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security selected by the Quotation Agent as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term from the redemption date to the stated maturity of the 2018 Notes, in the case of the 2018 Notes, or the Par Call Date, in the case of the 2025 Notes, that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of the Notes. "Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to any redemption date, if clause (ii) of the definition of Adjusted Treasury Rate is applicable, the average of four, or such lesser number as is obtained by the Quotation Agent, Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such redemption date. "Par Call Date" means the date that is three months prior to the maturity date of the 2025 Notes. "Quotation Agent" means one Reference Treasury Dealer selected by the Company. "Reference Treasury Dealer" means (i) each of Barclays Capital Inc., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, RBC Capital Markets, LLC and JxxPDPxxPD Morgan Securities LLC (or their respective affiliates that are Primary Treasury Dealers, as defined herein) and their respective successors; and (ii) one Primary Treasury Dealer selected by Mitsubishi UFJ Securities (USA), Inc. or its successor; provided, however, that if any of the foregoing shall cease to be a primary UxxPDSxxPD Government securities dealer in the United States (a "Primary Treasury Dealer"), we will substitute therefor another Primary Treasury Dealer, and (iii) any other Primary Treasury Dealer selected by us. "Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any redemption date, the average, as determined by a Reference Treasury Dealer, of the bid and asking prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue, expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount, quoted in writing to the Quotation Agent by such Reference Treasury Dealer at 5:00 pxxPDmxxPD, New York City time, on the third business day preceding such redemption date. If less than all of the Notes are to be redeemed, the Notes will be selected in accordance with the procedures of the depositary and which may provide for the selection for the redemption of portions (equal to $1,000 or any multiple thereof) of the principal amount of the Notes larger than $2,000.  Notice of redemption will be sent to each holder of Notes to be redeemed at the holder's address in the Security Register for the Notes or in accordance with the applicable procedures of the depositary.  If any Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that Note will state the portion of the principal amount of that Note to be redeemed.  In that case, the Company will issue a new Note of any authorized denomination, as requested, in an aggregate principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of such Note, in the name of the holder upon cancellation of the original Note. The Company will deliver notice of any redemption to holders of the Notes, not more than sixty (60) nor less than thirty (30) days before the redemption date. Unless the Company defaults in payment of the redemption price, on and after the redemption date, interest will cease to accrue on the Notes called for redemption. The Notes are not subject to any sinking fund. ARTICLE FIVE Provisions of the Original Indenture Not Applicable to the Notes SECTION 501. Section 401 of the Original Indenture. Section 401 of the Original Indenture shall not apply to the Notes.

This Security is one of the series designated on the face hereof, initially limited in aggregate principal amount to $150,000,000.  The provisions of this Security, together with the provisions of the Indenture, shall govern the rights, obligations, duties and immunities of the Holder, the Company and the Trustee with respect to this Security, provided that, if any provision of this Security conflicts with any provision of the Indenture, the provision of this Security shall be controlling to the fullest extent permitted under the Indenture. The Securities of this series are subject to redemption upon not less than thirty (30) or more than sixty (60) days' notice by mail to the Holders of such securities at their addresses in the Security Register, at the option of the Company, in whole or in part, from time to time.  If the Company elects to redeem the Securities, it will do so at a Redemption Price set forth in Section 401 of the Sixth Supplemental Indenture between the Company and the Trustee, dated January 1, 2015, which established the terms of the Securities. Except as otherwise provided in the Indenture, if notice has been given as provided in the Indenture and funds for the redemption of any Securities (or any portion thereof) called for redemption shall have been made available on the Redemption Date referred to in such notice, such Securities (or any portion thereof) will cease to bear interest on the date fixed for such redemption specified in such notice and the only right of the Holders of such Securities will be to receive payment of the Redemption Price. In the event of redemption of this Security in part only, a new Security or Securities of this series and of like tenor for the unredeemed portion hereof will be issued in the name of the Holder hereof upon the cancellation hereof. The Securities of this series will not be subject to any sinking fund. If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of this series shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Securities of this series may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture. The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the Holders of the Securities of each series to be affected under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding of all series to be affected (voting as one class).  The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of specified percentages in principal amount of the Securities of each series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences.  Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Security and of any Security issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security. No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Security or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and any premium and interest on this Security at the time, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed. This Security shall be exchangeable for Securities registered in the names of Persons other than the Depositary with respect to such series or its nominee only as provided in this paragraph.  This Security shall be so exchangeable if (x) the Depositary notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary for such series or at any time ceases to be a clearing agency registered as such under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, (y) the Company executes and delivers to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate providing that this Security shall be so exchangeable or (z) there shall have occurred and be continuing an Event of Default with respect to the Securities of the series of which this Security is a part.  Securities so issued in exchange for this Security shall be of the same series, having the same interest rate, if any, and maturity and having the same terms as this Security, in authorized denominations and in the aggregate having the same principal amount as this Security and registered in such names as the Depositary for such Global Security shall direct. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of a Security of the series of which this Security is a part is registrable in the Security Register, upon surrender of this Security for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Company in any place where the principal of and any premium and interest on this Security are payable, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Security Registrar duly executed by, the Holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Securities of this series and of like tenor, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees. The Securities of the series of which this Security is a part are issuable only in registered form without coupons in minimum denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 thereafter.  As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Securities of this series are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Securities of this series and of like tenor of a different authorized denomination, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same. No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith. Prior to due presentment of this Security for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Security is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Security be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary. For so long as this Security is issued in the form of a Global Security, neither the Company nor the Trustee will have any responsibility with respect to the policies and procedures of the Depositary or for any notices or other communications among the Depositary, its direct and indirect participants or the beneficial owners of this Security. Neither the failure to give any notice nor any defect in any notice given to the Holder of this Security or any other Security of this series will affect the sufficiency of any notice given to any other Holder of any Securities of this series. The Indenture provides that the Company, at its option (a) will be discharged from any and all obligations in respect of the Securities (except for certain obligations to register the transfer or exchange of Securities, replace stolen, lost or mutilated Securities, maintain paying agencies and hold moneys for payment in trust) or (b) need not comply with certain restrictive covenants of the Indenture, in each case if the Company deposits, in trust, with the Trustee money or UxxPDSxxPD Government Obligations which, through the payment of interest thereon and principal thereof in accordance with their terms, will provide money, in an amount sufficient to pay all the principal of and premium, if any and interest, if any, on the Securities on the dates such payments are due in accordance with the terms of such Securities, and certain other conditions are satisfied. No recourse shall be had for the payment of the principal of or the interest on this Security, or for any claim based hereon, or otherwise in respect hereof, or based on or in respect of the Indenture or any indenture supplemental thereto, against any trustee, incorporator, stockholder, officer or director, as such, past, present or future, of the Company or any successor corporation, either directly or through the Company or any successor corporation, whether by virtue of any constitution, statute or rule of law, or by the enforcement of any assessment or penalty or otherwise, all such liability being, by the acceptance hereof and as part of the consideration for the issuance hereof, expressly waived and released. The Declaration of Trust of the Company provides that no shareholder of the Company shall be held to any liability whatsoever for the payment of any sum of money, or for damages or otherwise under any contract, obligation or undertaking made, entered into or issued by the trustees of the Company or by any officer, agent or representative elected or appointed by the trustees and no such contract, obligation or undertaking shall be enforceable against the trustees or any of them in their or his individual capacities or capacity and all such contracts, obligations and undertakings shall be enforceable only against the trustees as such, and every person, firm, association, trust and corporation having any claim or demand arising out of any such contract, obligation or undertaking shall look only to the trust estate for the payment or satisfaction thereof. This Security shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York. All terms used in this Security not defined herein which are defined in the Indenture shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture. [The remainder of this page left blank intentionally.] IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Northeast Utilities has caused this instrument to be duly executed. NORTHEAST UTILITIES By: __________________________ Philip J.
