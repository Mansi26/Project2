 Split Loan Structure



 The Mortgaged Property that secures the Mortgage Loan identified as Loan No. 6 on the Mortgage Loan Schedule (the "Brunswick Square Mortgage Loan") also secures a companion loan to the same Borrower, which is pari passu in right of payment to the Brunswick Square Mortgage Loan (the "Brunswick Square Pari Passu Companion Loan").  The Brunswick Square Mortgage Loan and the Brunswick Square Pari Passu Companion Loan are collectively referred to as the "Brunswick Square Loan Combination."  The Brunswick Square Pari Passu







 Companion Loan and all amounts attributable thereto will not be assets of the Trust Fund, the REMIC Pools or the Grantor Trust and will be beneficially owned by the holder of the Brunswick Square Pari Passu Companion Loan.



 The Brunswick Square Loan Combination will initially be serviced pursuant to (i) this Agreement and (ii) the related Intercreditor Agreement.  After the securitization of the Brunswick Square Pari Passu Companion Loan, the Brunswick Square Loan Combination will be serviced pursuant to the related Non-Trust Pooling and Servicing Agreement and the related Intercreditor Agreement.

For purposes of reference only in this Agreement, and without in any way limiting the servicing rights and powers of the applicable Master Servicer and/or the applicable Special Servicer, with respect to any Cross-Collateralized Mortgage Loan (or successor REO Mortgage Loan with respect thereto), the Mortgaged Property (or REO Property) that relates or corresponds thereto shall be the property identified in the Mortgage Loan Schedule as corresponding thereto.  The provisions of this Agreement, including each of the defined terms set forth in Section 1.01, shall be interpreted in a manner consistent with this Section 1.04; provided that, if there exists with respect to any Cross-Collateralized Group only one original of any document referred to in the definition of "Mortgage File" covering all the Mortgage Loans in such Cross-Collateralized Group, then the inclusion of the original of such document in the Mortgage File for any of the Mortgage Loans constituting such Cross-Collateralized Group shall be deemed an inclusion of such original in the Mortgage File for each such Mortgage Loan.

 (a) It is the intention of the parties hereto that a common law trust be established under the laws of the State of New York pursuant to this Agreement and, further that such trust be designated as "WFRBS Commercial Mortgage Trust 2014-C19."  The fiscal year end of such trust shall be December 31.  Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas is hereby appointed, and does hereby agree to act, as Trustee hereunder and, in such capacity, to hold the Trust Fund in trust for the exclusive use and benefit of all present and future Certificateholders.







 This Agreement is not intended to create a partnership or a joint-stock association between or among any of the parties hereto.



 (b) The Depositor, concurrently with the execution and delivery hereof, does hereby transfer, assign, set over and otherwise convey to the Trustee, in trust, without recourse, for the benefit of the Certificateholders (and for the benefit of the other parties to this Agreement as their respective interests may appear) all the right, title and interest of the Depositor, in, to and under (i) the Original Mortgage Loans and all documents included in the related Mortgage Files and Servicing Files, (ii) the rights of the Depositor under Sections 2, 3, 4 (other than Section 4(c), (d) and (f)) and 5 (other than Section 5(f), (g), (h) and (i)) and, to the extent related to the foregoing, Sections 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17 and 18 of each Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement and (iii) all other assets included or to be included in the Trust Fund.  Such assignment includes (i) all scheduled payments of principal and interest under and proceeds of the Original Mortgage Loans received after their respective Cut-off Dates (other than scheduled payments of interest and principal due and payable on or before their respective Cut-off Dates, which amounts shall belong and be promptly remitted to the related Mortgage Loan Seller when and if received), together with all documents delivered or caused to be delivered hereunder with respect to the Original Mortgage Loans by the respective Mortgage Loan Sellers (including all documents included in the related Mortgage Files and Servicing Files and any related Additional Collateral); (ii) any REO Property acquired in respect of an Original Mortgage Loan (or, in the case of any REO Property related to a Non-Trust-Serviced Pooled Mortgage Loan, the beneficial interest of the holder of the related Non-Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan with respect thereto); and (iii) such funds or assets as from time to time are deposited in the Collection Accounts (but not in the Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Custodial Account), the Distribution Account, the Interest Reserve Account, the Excess Liquidation Proceeds Account and, if established, and subject to the rights of any related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder(s), the REO Account.  In addition, on the Closing Date the Depositor shall make a cash deposit to the applicable Master Servicer in an amount equal to the Interest Deposit Amount.

 After the Depositor's transfer of the Original Mortgage Loans to the Trustee pursuant to this Section 2.01(b), the Depositor shall not take any action inconsistent with the Trust's ownership of the Mortgage Loans.



 (c) The conveyance of the Original Mortgage Loans and the related rights and property accomplished hereby is absolute and is intended by the parties hereto to constitute an absolute transfer of the Original Mortgage Loans and such other related rights and property by the Depositor to the Trustee for the benefit of the Certificateholders (and the Trustee as holder of the Class A-S, Class B and Class C Regular Interests).  Furthermore, it is not intended that such conveyance be a pledge of security for a loan.  If such conveyance is determined to be a pledge of security for a loan, however, the Depositor and the Trustee intend that the rights and obligations of the parties to such loan shall be established pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.  The Depositor and the Trustee also intend and agree that, in such event, (i) this Agreement shall constitute a security agreement under applicable law, (ii) the Depositor shall be

The Depositor shall cooperate in a reasonable manner with the Certificate Administrator in the preparation and filing of such continuation statements.  This Section 2.01(c) shall constitute notice to the Certificate Administrator pursuant to any requirements of the UCC in effect in each applicable jurisdiction.



 (d) In connection with the Depositor's assignment pursuant to Section 2.01(b) above, the parties acknowledge that each Mortgage Loan Seller is obligated, at such Mortgage Loan Seller's expense, pursuant to the related Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement, to deliver to and deposit with, or cause to be delivered to and deposited with, the Custodian, (i) on or before the Closing Date, the Mortgage Note relating to each Mortgage Loan so assigned, endorsed to the Trustee as specified in clause (i) of the definition of "Mortgage File" (or, alternatively, if the original executed Mortgage Note has been lost, a lost note affidavit and indemnity with a copy of such Mortgage Note as specified in clause (i) of the definition of "Mortgage File")  and (ii) on or before the respective delivery dates therefor set forth in the related Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement, the remainder of the Mortgage File and any Additional Collateral (other than Reserve Funds and originals of Letters of Credit, all of which are to be transferred to the applicable Master Servicer) for each Original Mortgage Loan acquired by the Depositor from such Mortgage Loan Seller.

 Loan (exclusive of a Non-Trust-Serviced Pooled Mortgage Loan), if any, as to which there exists a secured creditor impaired property insurance policy or pollution limited liability environmental impairment policy covering the related Mortgaged Property, the related Mortgage Loan Seller is contractually obligated to cause such policy, within a reasonable period following the Closing Date, to inure to the benefit of the Trustee on behalf of the Certificateholders (if and to the extent that it does not by its terms automatically inure to the holder of such Mortgage Loan).  The Depositor shall deliver to the Trustee and the Custodian on or before the Closing Date a fully executed counterpart of each Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement.



 With respect to a Non-Trust-Serviced Pooled Mortgage Loan, the parties hereto acknowledge the provisions of the related Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement in which the related Mortgage Loan Seller represents, warrants and covenants to the effect that the documents described in clauses (ii), (iii) and (xi) of the definition of "Mortgage File" and documents comparable to those described in clauses (iv), (vi) and (ix)(B) of the definition of "Mortgage File" will be delivered to the Non-Trust Trustee or Non-Trust Custodian under the related Non-Trust Pooling and Servicing Agreement, except to the extent that the absence of such document does not constitute a breach pursuant to the terms of the related Non-Trust Pooling and Servicing Agreement.

None of the Depositor, the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator, the Custodian, the Trust Advisor, the Master Servicers or the Special Servicers shall be liable for any failure by any Mortgage Loan Seller to comply with the document delivery requirements of the related Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement.

To the extent that the Mortgage File relates to a Mortgage Loan that is part of a Serviced Loan Combination, the Custodian shall also hold such Mortgage File in trust for the use and benefit of the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder(s).  The applicable Master Servicer acknowledges receipt of all of the original Letters of Credit relating to the Mortgage Loans or Serviced Loan Combination delivered to it (copies of which are part of the Mortgage File) and agrees to hold such Letters of Credit in trust for the benefit of the Trustee.  In connection with the foregoing, the Custodian hereby certifies to each of the other parties hereto, each Mortgage Loan Seller and each Underwriter that, as to each Mortgage Loan, except as specifically identified in the Schedule of Exceptions to Mortgage File Delivery attached hereto as Schedule II, (i) all documents specified in clause (i) of the definition of "Mortgage File" are in its possession, and (ii) the original Mortgage Note (or, if accompanied by a lost note affidavit and indemnity, the copy of such Mortgage Note) received by it with respect to such Mortgage Loan has been reviewed by it and (A) appears regular on its face (handwritten additions, changes or corrections shall not constitute irregularities if initialed by the Borrower), (B) appears to have been executed (where appropriate) and (C) purports to relate to such Mortgage Loan.



 (b) On or about the 75th day following the Closing Date, the Custodian shall review the documents delivered to it with respect to each Original Mortgage Loan, and the Custodian shall, subject to Sections 1.04, 2.02(c) and 2.02(d), certify in writing (and, if any exceptions are noted or if the recordation/filing contemplated by Section 2.01(e) has not been completed (based solely on receipt by the Custodian of the particular documents showing evidence of the recordation/filing), the Custodian shall deliver updates to any exception list attached to such certification in accordance with the penultimate sentence of this paragraph) to each of the other parties hereto (substantially in the form of Exhibit M), the Mortgage Loan Sellers, the Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder(s) (in each case, provided that the Custodian has received notice of the identity of and notice address information for such Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder), the Majority Subordinate Certificateholder and the







 Subordinate Class Representative that, as to each Original Mortgage Loan then subject to this Agreement (except as specifically identified in any exception report annexed to such certification):  (i) the original Mortgage Note specified in clause (i) of the definition of "Mortgage File" and all allonges thereto, if any (or a copy of such Mortgage Note, together with a lost note affidavit and indemnity), the original or copy of documents specified in clauses (ii), (iii), (iv) (except with respect to a Non-Trust-Serviced Pooled Mortgage Loan), (viii) (without regard to the verification of the effective date with respect to a title policy or the date of funding with respect to a title commitment), (x) (if the Mortgage Loan Schedule specifies that a material portion of the interest of the Borrower in the related Mortgaged Property consists of a leasehold interest) and (xx) (if the Mortgage Loan Schedule specifies that the Mortgaged Property type is a hospitality property) of the definition of "Mortgage File" have been received by it; (ii) if such report is due more than 180 days after the Closing Date, the recordation/filing contemplated by Section 2.01(e) has been completed (based solely on receipt by the Custodian of the particular recorded/filed documents or an appropriate receipt of recording/filing therefor); (iii) all documents received by it with respect to such Mortgage Loan have been reviewed by it and (A) appear regular on their face (handwritten additions, changes or corrections shall not constitute irregularities if initialed by the Borrower), (B) appear to have been executed and (C) purport to relate to such Mortgage Loan; and (iv) based on the examinations referred to in Section 2.02(a) above and this Section 2.02(b) and only as to the foregoing documents, the information set forth in the Mortgage Loan Schedule with respect to the items specified in clause (iii)(A) and clause (vi) of the definition of "Mortgage Loan Schedule" accurately reflects the information set forth in the related Mortgage File.  Every ninety (90) days after such 75th day following the Closing Date, until the earlier of (i) the date on which such exceptions are eliminated and such recordation/filing has been completed, and (ii) the date on which all the affected Mortgage Loans are removed from the Trust Fund, the Custodian shall deliver electronically to the Mortgage Loan Sellers, any Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder(s), the Majority Subordinate Certificateholder and the Subordinate Class Representative an update to the exception report annexed to the certification described above substantially in the form of Exhibit M, which update shall report any remaining outstanding exceptions with respect to each Original Mortgage Loan.  Such delivery shall be deemed to constitute a certification of the substance of the matters set forth in the form of such Exhibit M (except as set forth in such exception report).  The applicable Master Servicer shall provide the contact name, mailing address and e-mail address of any Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder(s) to the applicable Special Servicer, the Trustee, the Custodian and the Certificate Administrator to the extent not previously provided thereto, provided that such Master Servicer has such information.  The contact name, mailing address and e-mail address of each initial Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder is set forth on Schedule IX hereto.



 (c) If a Responsible Repurchase Party substitutes a Replacement Mortgage Loan for any Defective Mortgage Loan as contemplated by Section 2.03, the Custodian shall review the documents delivered to it with respect to such Replacement Mortgage Loan, and the Custodian shall deliver a certification comparable to that described in the prior paragraph, in respect of such Replacement Mortgage Loan, on or about the 30th day following the related date of substitution (and, if any exceptions are noted, every ninety (90) days thereafter until the earlier of (i) the date on which such exceptions are eliminated and all related recording/filing has been completed, and (ii) the date on which such Replacement Mortgage Loan is removed from the Trust Fund).







 With respect to the documents described in clause (iii) of the definition of "Mortgage File," absent actual knowledge to the contrary, the Custodian may assume, for purposes of the certification(s) delivered in this Section 2.02(c) or to be delivered pursuant to Section 2.02(b), that the Mortgage File for each Mortgage Loan includes a separate Assignment of Leases.



 With respect to the documents described in clause (ix) of the definition of "Mortgage File," absent actual knowledge to the contrary or copies of UCC Financing Statements delivered to the Custodian as part of the Mortgage File indicating otherwise, the Custodian may assume, for purposes of the certification(s) to be delivered pursuant to this Section 2.02(c), that the Mortgage File for each Mortgage Loan should include a copy of one state-level UCC Financing Statement filed in the state of incorporation or organization of the related Borrower for each Mortgaged Property (or with respect to any Mortgage Loan that has two or more Borrowers, for each related Borrower).  To the extent appropriate under applicable law, the UCC Financing Statements to be assigned to the Trustee will be delivered on the new national forms and in recordable form and will be filed in the state of incorporation or organization as so indicated on the documents provided.



 (d) None of the Depositor, the Certificate Administrator, the Trustee, any Master Servicer, any Sub-Servicer, any Special Servicer, the Trust Advisor or the Custodian is under any duty or obligation to (i) determine whether any of the documents specified in clauses (iii), (iv)(B), (v), (vi), (vii), (ix) and (xi) through (xviii) of the definition of "Mortgage File" exist or are required to be delivered by the Mortgage Loan Sellers in respect of any Mortgage Loan unless such item(s) are specified on the related Mortgage File Checklist, or (ii) inspect, review or examine any of the documents, instruments, certificates or other papers relating to the Mortgage Loans delivered to it to determine that the same are valid, legal, effective, genuine, binding, enforceable, sufficient or appropriate for the represented purpose or that they are other than what they purport to be on their face.  Furthermore, except as expressly provided in Section 2.01(e), none of the Depositor, the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator, the Master Servicers, any Sub-Servicer, the Special Servicers, the Trust Advisor or the Custodian shall have any responsibility for determining whether the text of any assignment or endorsement is in proper or recordable form, whether the requisite recording of any document is in accordance with the requirements of any applicable jurisdiction, or whether a blanket assignment is permitted in any applicable jurisdiction.



 (e) In performing the reviews contemplated by subsections (a) and (b) above, the Custodian may conclusively rely on the related Mortgage Loan Seller as to the purported genuineness of any such document and any signature thereon.  It is understood that the scope of the Custodian's review of the Mortgage Files is limited solely to confirming that the documents specified in clauses (i), (ii), (iii), (iv) (except with respect to a Non-Trust-Serviced Pooled Mortgage Loan), (viii) (without regard to the verification of the effective date with respect to a title policy or the date of funding with respect to a title commitment), (x) (if the Mortgage Loan Schedule specifies that a material portion of the interest of the Borrower in the related Mortgaged Property consists of a leasehold interest) and (xx) (if the Mortgage Loan Schedule specifies that the Mortgaged Property type is a hospitality property) of the definition of "Mortgage File" have been received by it and such additional information as will be necessary for delivering the certifications required by subsections (a) and (b) above.







 Section 2.03 Certain Repurchases and Substitutions of Mortgage Loans by the Responsible Repurchase Parties.



 (a) If, in the process of reviewing the documents delivered or caused to be delivered by the Mortgage Loan Sellers as contemplated by Section 2.01(d), the Custodian discovers that any document required to have been delivered as contemplated by Section 2.01(d) has not been so delivered, or discovers that any of the documents that were delivered has not been properly executed, contains information that does not conform in any material respect with the corresponding information set forth in the Mortgage Loan Schedule, or is defective on its face (each, including, without limitation, that a document is missing, a "Document Defect"), or if, at any other time, the Custodian or any other party hereto discovers (without implying that any such party has a duty to make or attempt to make such discovery) a Document Defect in respect of any Mortgage Loan, the party discovering such Document Defect shall promptly so notify each of the other parties hereto.  If any party hereto discovers (without implying that any such party has a duty to make or attempt to make such discovery) or receives notice of a breach of any representation or warranty relating to any Mortgage Loan set forth in or made pursuant to Section 4(b) or 4(g) of any Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement (a "Breach"), such party shall promptly so notify each of the other parties hereto.  Upon the Trustee's discovery or receipt of notice that a Document Defect or Breach exists with respect to any Mortgage Loan, the Trustee shall notify the Subordinate Class Representative, the Majority Subordinate Certificateholder, the Depositor, the Certificate Administrator, the Custodian, the applicable Master Servicer, the applicable Special Servicer, the related Responsible Repurchase Party and the Rating Agencies.



 (b) Promptly upon its actual knowledge of any Material Document Defect or Material Breach with respect to any Mortgage Loan or its receipt of notice from the Trustee or any other party to this Agreement of a Material Document Defect or Material Breach with respect to any Mortgage Loan, the applicable Special Servicer shall notify the related Responsible Repurchase Party in writing (in each case, with a copy to the Depositor) of such Material Document Defect or Material Breach, as the case may be, and direct such Responsible Repurchase Party that it must, not later than (1) ninety (90) days from discovery of the subject Material Document Defect or Material Breach by the Responsible Repurchase Party, or (2) ninety (90) days from the receipt by such Responsible Repurchase Party of such notice (or, if (x) such Material Breach or Material Document Defect, as the case may be, relates to whether such Mortgage Loan is or, as of the Closing Date (or, in the case of a Replacement Mortgage Loan, as of the related date of substitution), was a Qualified Mortgage, and (y) such Responsible Repurchase Party discovered or received prompt written notice of the relation specified in clause (x), then (z) within ninety (90) days after any earlier discovery by the Responsible Repurchase Party or any party to this Agreement of such Material Breach or Material Document Defect, as the case may be) (such 90-day period, in any case, the "Initial Resolution Period"), correct or cure such Material Document Defect or Material Breach, as the case may be, in all material respects, or repurchase the affected Mortgage Loan (as, if and to the extent required by the related Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement), at the applicable Purchase Price; provided that if such Responsible Repurchase Party certifies to the Trustee in writing (i) that such Material Document Defect or Material Breach, as the case may be, does not relate to whether the affected Mortgage Loan is or, as of the Closing Date (or, in the case of a Replacement Mortgage Loan, as of the related date of substitution), was a Qualified Mortgage, (ii) that such Material Document Defect or Material Breach, as the case may be, is capable of being cured but not within the







 applicable Initial Resolution Period, (iii) that such Responsible Repurchase Party has commenced and is diligently proceeding with the cure of such Material Document Defect or Material Breach, as the case may be, during the applicable Initial Resolution Period, (iv) in the case of a Material Document Defect, that (x) the related Mortgage Loan is not, at the end of the Initial Resolution Period, then a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan and a Servicing Transfer Event has not occurred as a result of a monetary default or as described in clause (e), (f) or (g) of the definition of "Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan" in this Agreement and (y) the Material Document Defect was not identified in a certification delivered to the Mortgage Loan Seller by the Custodian pursuant to Section 2.02 not less than ninety (90) days prior to the delivery of the notice of such Material Document Defect, and (v) that such Responsible Repurchase Party anticipates that such Material Document Defect or Material Breach, as the case may be, will be cured within an additional 90-day period (such additional 90-day period, the "Resolution Extension Period") (a copy of which certification shall be delivered by the Trustee to the Depositor, the applicable Master Servicer, the applicable Special Servicer, the Subordinate Class Representative, the Majority Subordinate Certificateholder and the Rating Agencies), then such Responsible Repurchase Party shall have an additional period equal to the Resolution Extension Period to complete such correction or cure (or, upon failure to complete such correction or cure, for the applicable Responsible Repurchase Party to repurchase the affected Mortgage Loan); and provided, further, however, that, in lieu of repurchasing the affected Mortgage Loan as contemplated above (but, in any event, no later than such repurchase would have to have been completed), the applicable Responsible Repurchase Party shall be permitted, during the three-month period commencing on the Startup Day for the REMIC Pool that holds the affected Mortgage Loan (or during the two-year period commencing on such Startup Day if the affected Mortgage Loan is a "defective obligation" within the meaning of Section 860G(a)(4)(B)(ii) of the Code and Treasury Regulations Section 1.860G-2(f)), to replace the affected Mortgage Loan with one or more Qualifying Substitute Mortgage Loans and to pay a cash amount equal to the applicable Substitution Shortfall Amount, subject to any other applicable terms and conditions of the related Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement and this Agreement.  The parties hereto agree that delivery by the Custodian of a certification or schedule of exceptions to a Mortgage Loan Seller or Responsible Repurchase Party shall not in and of itself constitute delivery of notice of any Material Document Defect or knowledge of such Mortgage Loan Seller or Responsible Repurchase Party of any Material Document Defect.  If any Mortgage Loan is to be repurchased or replaced as contemplated by this Section 2.03, the applicable Master Servicer shall designate the Collection Account as the account to which funds in the amount of the applicable Purchase Price or Substitution Shortfall Amount (as the case may be) are to be wired, and the applicable Master Servicer shall promptly notify the Trustee and the Certificate Administrator when such deposit is made.  Any such repurchase or replacement of a Mortgage Loan shall be on a whole loan, servicing released basis.  Notwithstanding this Section 2.03(b), the absence from the Mortgage File, (i) on the Closing Date of the Mortgage Note (or a lost note affidavit and indemnity with a copy of the Mortgage Note) and (ii) by the first anniversary of the Closing Date, of originals or copies of any other Specially Designated Mortgage Loan Document (without the presence of any factor that reasonably mitigates such absence, non-conformity or irregularity) shall (if the absence results from the related Mortgage Loan Seller's failure to deliver such Specially Designated Mortgage Loan Document in accordance with the terms of the related Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement) be conclusively presumed to be a Material Document Defect and shall obligate the party discovering such







 absence to give the Trustee prompt notice, whereupon the Trustee shall notify the applicable Responsible Repurchase Party (with a copy to the Depositor) to cure such Material Document Defect, or, failing that, repurchase or replace the related Mortgage Loan or REO Mortgage Loan, all in accordance with the procedures set forth, and to the extent permitted, herein and in the related Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement.  Notwithstanding this Section 2.03(b), in the event of any Breach described in the second paragraph of Section 5(d) of any Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement, the remedy described in such second paragraph of such Section 5(d) shall constitute the sole remedy available to the Trustee and any other affected Person with respect to such Breach.



 The remedies provided for in this Section 2.03(b) with respect to any Material Document Defect or Material Breach with respect to any Mortgage Loan shall apply to the related REO Property.



 If (x) a Defective Mortgage Loan is to be repurchased or replaced as described above, (y) such Defective Mortgage Loan is part of a Cross-Collateralized Group and (z) the applicable Document Defect or Breach does not constitute a Material Document Defect or Material Breach, as the case may be, as to the other Mortgage Loan(s) that are a part of such Cross-Collateralized Group (the "Other Crossed Loans") (without regard to this paragraph), then the applicable Document Defect or Breach (as the case may be) shall be deemed to constitute a Material Document Defect or Material Breach (as the case may be) as to each such Other Crossed Loan for purposes of the above provisions, and the related Responsible Repurchase Party shall be obligated to repurchase or replace each such Other Crossed Loan in accordance with the provisions above unless, in the case of such Breach or Document Defect:



 (A) the related Responsible Repurchase Party (at its expense) delivers or causes to be delivered to the Trustee, the applicable Master Servicer and the applicable Special Servicer an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such Responsible Repurchase Party's repurchase of only those Mortgage Loans as to which a Material Document Defect or Material Breach has actually occurred without regard to the provisions of this paragraph (the "Affected Loan(s)") and the operation of the remaining provisions of this Section 2.03(b) will not result in an Adverse REMIC Event or any Adverse Grantor Trust Event hereunder; and



 (B) each of the following conditions would be satisfied if the related Responsible Repurchase Party were to repurchase or replace only the Affected Loans and not the Other Crossed Loans:



 (I)           the debt service coverage ratio for such Other Crossed Loan(s) (excluding the Affected Loan(s)) for the four calendar quarters immediately preceding the repurchase or replacement is not less than the least of (A) 0.10x below the debt service coverage ratio for the Cross-Collateralized Group (including the Affected Loan(s)) set forth in Annex A to the Prospectus Supplement, (B) the debt service coverage ratio for the Cross-Collateralized Group (including the Affected Loan(s)) for the four preceding calendar quarters preceding the repurchase or replacement and (C) 1.25x;







 (II)           the loan-to-value ratio for the Other Crossed Loans is not greater than the greatest of (A) the loan-to-value ratio, expressed as a whole number percentage (taken to one decimal place), for the Cross-Collateralized Group (including the Affected Loan(s)) set forth in Annex A to the Prospectus Supplement plus 10%, (B) the loan-to-value ratio, expressed as a whole number percentage (taken to one decimal place), for the Cross-Collateralized Group (including the Affected Loan(s)) at the time of repurchase or replacement and (C) 75%; and



 (III)           the exercise of remedies against the Primary Collateral of any Mortgage Loan in the Cross-Collateralized Group shall not impair the ability to exercise remedies against the Primary Collateral of the other Mortgage Loans in the Cross-Collateralized Group.



 The determination of the applicable Special Servicer as to whether the conditions set forth above have been satisfied shall be conclusive and binding in the absence of manifest error.  The applicable Special Servicer will be entitled to cause to be delivered, or direct the related Responsible Repurchase Party to cause to be delivered, to the applicable Special Servicer an Appraisal of any or all of the related Mortgaged Properties for purposes of determining whether the condition set forth in clause (ii) above has been satisfied, in each case at the expense of the related Responsible Repurchase Party if the scope and cost of the Appraisal is approved by the related Responsible Repurchase Party and the Subordinate Class Representative (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld in each case).



 With respect to any Defective Mortgage Loan that forms a part of a Cross-Collateralized Group and as to which the conditions described in the preceding paragraph are satisfied, such that the Trust Fund will continue to hold the Other Crossed Loans, the related Responsible Repurchase Party and the Trustee, as successor to the Depositor, are bound by an agreement (set forth in the related Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement) to forbear from enforcing any remedies against the other's Primary Collateral but each is permitted to exercise remedies against the Primary Collateral securing its respective Mortgage Loans, including with respect to the Trustee, the Primary Collateral securing the Affected Loan(s) still held by the Trustee.  If the exercise of remedies by one such party would impair the ability of the other such party to exercise its remedies with respect to the Primary Collateral securing the Affected Loan or the Other Crossed Loans, as the case may be, held by the other such party, then both parties have agreed to forbear from exercising such remedies unless and until the Mortgage Loan Documents evidencing and securing the relevant Mortgage Loans can be modified in a manner that complies with the applicable Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement to remove the threat of impairment as a result of the exercise of remedies.  Any reserve or other cash collateral or Letters of Credit securing any of the Mortgage Loans that form a Cross-Collateralized Group shall be allocated between such Mortgage Loans in accordance with the Mortgage Loan Documents, or otherwise on a pro rata basis based upon their outstanding Stated Principal Balances.  All other terms of the Mortgage Loans shall remain in full force and effect, without any modification thereof.  The provisions of this paragraph shall be binding on all future holders of each Mortgage Loan that forms part of a Cross-Collateralized Group.







 To the extent necessary and appropriate, the Trustee shall execute (or, subject to Section 3.01(b) and Section 3.10, provide the applicable Special Servicer with a limited power of attorney that enables the applicable Special Servicer to execute) the modification of the Mortgage Loan Documents that complies with the applicable Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement to remove the threat of impairment of the ability of the Responsible Repurchase Party or the Trust Fund to exercise its remedies with respect to the Primary Collateral securing the Mortgage Loan(s) held by such party resulting from the exercise of remedies by the other such party; provided that the Trustee shall not be liable for any misuse of any such power of attorney by the Special Servicer.  The applicable Master Servicer shall advance all costs and expenses incurred by the Trustee, the applicable Master Servicer and the applicable Special Servicer with respect to any Cross-Collateralized Group pursuant to this paragraph, and such advances and interest thereon shall (i) constitute and be reimbursable as Servicing Advances and (ii) be included in the calculation of Purchase Price for the Mortgage Loan(s) to be repurchased or replaced.  Neither the applicable Master Servicer nor the applicable Special Servicer shall be liable to any Certificateholder or any other party hereto if a modification of the Mortgage Loan Documents described above cannot be effected for any reason beyond the control of the applicable Master Servicer or the applicable Special Servicer, respectively.



 The reasonable "out-of-pocket" costs and expenses incurred by the applicable Master Servicer, the applicable Special Servicer, the Trustee and/or the Custodian pursuant to this Section 2.03(b), including reasonable attorney fees and expenses, shall constitute Servicing Advances to the extent not collected from the related Responsible Repurchase Party.



 (c) Whenever one or more Replacement Mortgage Loans are substituted for a Defective Mortgage Loan by a Mortgage Loan Seller as contemplated by this Section 2.03, the applicable Special Servicer shall direct the party effecting the substitution to deliver to the Custodian the related Mortgage File and a certification to the effect that such Replacement Mortgage Loan satisfies or such Replacement Mortgage Loans satisfy, as the case may be, all of the requirements of the definition of "Qualifying Substitute Mortgage Loan."  No mortgage loan may be substituted for a Defective Mortgage Loan as contemplated by this Section 2.03 if the Mortgage Loan to be replaced was itself a Replacement Mortgage Loan, in which case, absent a cure of the relevant Material Breach or Material Document Defect, the affected Mortgage Loan shall be repurchased as contemplated hereby.  Monthly Payments due with respect to each Replacement Mortgage Loan (if any) after the related date of substitution, and Monthly Payments due with respect to each corresponding Deleted Mortgage Loan (if any) after its respective Cut-off Date and on or prior to the related date of substitution, shall be part of the Trust Fund.  Monthly Payments due with respect to each Replacement Mortgage Loan (if any) on or prior to the related date of substitution, and Monthly Payments due with respect to each corresponding Deleted Mortgage Loan (if any) after the related date of substitution, shall not be part of the Trust Fund and are to be remitted by the applicable Master Servicer to the party effecting the related substitution promptly following receipt.



 If any Mortgage Loan is to be repurchased or replaced by a Responsible Repurchase Party as contemplated by this Section 2.03, the applicable Special Servicer shall direct such party to amend the Mortgage Loan Schedule to reflect the removal of any Deleted Mortgage Loan and, if applicable, the substitution of the related Replacement Mortgage Loan(s); and, upon its receipt of such amended Mortgage Loan Schedule, the applicable Special Servicer







 shall deliver or cause the delivery of such amended Mortgage Loan Schedule to the other parties hereto.  Upon any substitution of one or more Replacement Mortgage Loans for a Deleted Mortgage Loan, such Replacement Mortgage Loan(s) shall become part of the Trust Fund and be subject to the terms of this Agreement in all respects.



 The reasonable "out-of-pocket" costs and expenses incurred by the applicable Master Servicer, the applicable Special Servicer, the Trustee and/or the Custodian pursuant to this Section 2.03(c), including reasonable attorney fees and expenses, shall constitute Servicing Advances to the extent not collected from the related Responsible Repurchase Party.



 (d) Upon receipt of an Officer's Certificate from the applicable Master Servicer to the effect that the full amount of the Purchase Price or Substitution Shortfall Amount (as the case may be) for any Mortgage Loan repurchased or replaced by the related Responsible Repurchase Party as contemplated by this Section 2.03 has been deposited in the Collection Account, and further, if applicable, upon receipt of the Mortgage File for each Replacement Mortgage Loan (if any) to be substituted for a Deleted Mortgage Loan, together with any certifications and/or opinions required pursuant to Section 2.03(b) to be delivered by the applicable Responsible Repurchase Party, the Trustee and the Custodian shall each (i) release the Mortgage File and any Additional Collateral held by it or on its behalf for the Deleted Mortgage Loan to the related Responsible Repurchase Party or its designee and (ii) execute and deliver such instruments of release, transfer and/or assignment, in each case without recourse, as shall be provided to it and are reasonably necessary to vest in the applicable Responsible Repurchase Party or its designee the ownership of the Deleted Mortgage Loan, and the applicable Special Servicer shall notify the Depositor and the affected Borrowers of the transfers of the Deleted Mortgage Loan(s) and any Replacement Mortgage Loan(s).  In connection with any such repurchase or substitution by the related Responsible Repurchase Party, each of the applicable Master Servicer and the applicable Special Servicer shall deliver to the applicable Responsible Repurchase Party or its designee any portion of the related Servicing File, together with any Escrow Payments, Reserve Funds and Additional Collateral, held by or on behalf of the applicable Master Servicer or the applicable Special Servicer, as the case may be, with respect to the Deleted Mortgage Loan, in each case at the expense of such Responsible Repurchase Party.  The reasonable "out-of-pocket" costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses, incurred by the applicable Master Servicer, the applicable Special Servicer, the Trustee and/or the Custodian pursuant to this Section 2.03(d), to the extent not collected from the related Responsible Repurchase Party, shall be reimbursable to each of them as Servicing Advances in respect of the affected Mortgage Loan.



 (e) The related Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement provides the sole remedies available to the Certificateholders, or the Trustee on their behalf, respecting any Document Defect or Breach with respect to any Mortgage Loan.  If, in connection with any Material Document Defect or Material Breach, the related Responsible Repurchase Party defaults on its obligations to cure such Material Document Defect or Material Breach and fails to deliver a Loss of Value Payment as provided in Section 2.03(h), as the case may be, in all material respects or to repurchase or replace the affected Mortgage Loan as contemplated by this Section 2.03, then the applicable Special Servicer shall promptly notify the Trustee, the applicable Master Servicer, the Depositor, the Certificate Administrator, the Subordinate Class Representative and the Majority Subordinate Certificateholder, and the Certificate







 Administrator shall notify the Certificateholders.  Thereafter, the Trustee shall (and the applicable Special Servicer may in its own name, or, as provided in Section 3.01(b) below, in the name of the Trustee) take such actions on behalf of the Trust with respect to the enforcement of such repurchase/substitution obligations, including the institution and prosecution of appropriate legal proceedings, as the Trustee (or, if applicable, the applicable Special Servicer) shall determine are in the best interests of the Certificateholders (taken as a collective whole).  Any and all reasonable "out-of-pocket" costs and expenses incurred by the applicable Master Servicer, the Trustee and/or the applicable Special Servicer pursuant to this Section 2.03(e), including, reasonable attorney's fees and expenses, to the extent not collected from the related Responsible Repurchase Party, shall constitute Servicing Advances in respect of the affected Mortgage Loan.



 (f) The Trustee shall not consent to the assignment by a Mortgage Loan Seller or Responsible Repurchase Party of their respective obligations under any Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement unless such assignment is the subject of a Rating Agency Confirmation and, during any Subordinate Control Period, with the consent of the Subordinate Class Representative, which consent shall be deemed given if the Subordinate Class Representative does not respond within five (5) Business Days of receipt of the Trustee's request.



 (g) If the Depositor, the applicable Master Servicer or the applicable Special Servicer (each a "Repurchase Request Recipient"):  (1) receives a Repurchase Communication of a request or demand for repurchase or replacement of any Mortgage Loan alleging a Document Defect or a Breach (a "Repurchase Request"); (2) receives a Repurchase Communication of a withdrawal of a Repurchase Request by the Person making such Repurchase Request (a "Repurchase Request Withdrawal"); or (3) receives a Repurchase Communication that any Mortgage Loan that was subject of a Repurchase Request has been repurchased or replaced (a "Repurchase") or that such Repurchase Request has been rejected (a "Repurchase Request Rejection"), then such party shall give written notice thereof to the applicable Mortgage Loan Seller and the other parties hereto and the Other Depositor (if applicable) promptly but in any case within ten (10) Business Days from the date of receipt thereof.  Each notice required by this Section 2.03(g) (a "Rule 15Ga-1 Notice") shall include:  (i) the date that the Repurchase Communication relating to the Repurchase Request, Repurchase Request Withdrawal, Repurchase or Repurchase Request Rejection, as applicable, was received by the Repurchase Request Recipient; (ii) the identity of the Person making or withdrawing any such Repurchase Communication and the related Mortgage Loan; (iii) in the case of a Repurchase Communication of a Repurchase Request, the basis for the Repurchase Request asserted by the Person making the Repurchase Request, to the extent known to the Repurchase Request Recipient; and (iv) in the case of a Repurchase Communication of a Repurchase Request received by the applicable Special Servicer, a statement from the applicable Special Servicer as to whether it currently plans to pursue such Repurchase Request pursuant to Section 2.03(b).

 If the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator,  the Custodian or any Master Servicer receives a Repurchase Communication of a Repurchase Request, Repurchase Request Withdrawal, Repurchase or Repurchase Request Rejection, such party shall forward such Repurchase Communication as soon as possible and in any event, no later than three (3) Business Days following receipt of such Repurchase Communication to the applicable Special Servicer and shall include the following statement in the related correspondence:  "This is a Repurchase Communication of a ["Repurchase Request"] ["Repurchase Request Withdrawal"] ["Repurchase"] ["Repurchase Request Rejection"] under Section 2.03 of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement relating to the WFRBS 2014-C19 Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates requiring action by you as the "Repurchase Request Recipient" of such Repurchase Communication thereunder."  Upon receipt of any Repurchase Communication of a Repurchase Request, Repurchase Request Withdrawal, Repurchase or Repurchase Request Rejection by the applicable Special Servicer pursuant to the prior sentence, such party shall be deemed a Repurchase Request Recipient in respect of such Repurchase Request, Repurchase Request Withdrawal, Repurchase or Repurchase Request Rejection, as applicable, and such party shall comply with the procedures set forth in the prior paragraph of this Section 2.03(g) with respect to such Repurchase Communication of such Repurchase Request, Repurchase Request Withdrawal, Repurchase or Repurchase Request Rejection.

 The parties hereto agree that delivery of a Rule 15Ga-1 Notice shall not in and of itself constitute delivery of notice of any Material Document Defect or Material Breach or knowledge on the part of the Responsible Repurchase Party of any Material Document Defect or Material Breach.



 (h) If a Mortgage Loan Seller (or, if applicable, a related Responsible Repurchase Party), in connection with a Material Document Defect or a Material Breach (or an allegation of a Material Document Defect or a Material Breach) pertaining to a Mortgage Loan, makes a cash payment pursuant to an agreement or a settlement between the applicable Mortgage Loan Seller (or, if applicable, a related Responsible Repurchase Party) and the applicable Special







 Servicer on behalf of the Trust (with the consent of the Majority Subordinate Certificateholder to the extent a Subordinate Control Period or Collective Consultation Period is then in effect) (each such payment, a "Loss of Value Payment") with respect to such Mortgage Loan, the amount of such Loss of Value Payment shall be deposited into the Loss of Value Reserve Fund to be applied in accordance with Section 3.05(h)) of this Agreement.  If such Loss of Value Payment is made, the Loss of Value Payment shall serve as the sole remedy available to the Certificateholders and the Trustee on their behalf regarding any such Material Breach or Material Document Defect in lieu of any obligation of the Mortgage Loan Seller (or, if applicable, a related Responsible Repurchase Party) to otherwise cure such Material Breach or Material Document Defect or repurchase or substitute for the affected Mortgage Loan based on such Material Breach or Material Document Defect under any circumstances.  This paragraph is intended to apply only to a mutual agreement or settlement between the applicable Mortgage Loan Seller (or, if applicable, a related Responsible Repurchase Party)  and the Trust, provided, that prior to any such agreement or settlement nothing in this paragraph shall preclude the Mortgage Loan Seller (or, if applicable, a related Responsible Repurchase Party) or the Trustee from exercising any of its rights related to a Material Document Defect or a Material Breach in the manner and timing set forth in the related Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement or this Section 2.03 (excluding this paragraph) (including any right to cure, repurchase or substitute for such Mortgage Loan), and provided, further, that such Loss of Value Payment shall not be greater than the repurchase price of the affected Mortgage Loan; and provided, further that a Material Document Defect or a Material Breach as a result of a Mortgage Loan not constituting a "qualified mortgage" within the meaning of Section 860G(a)(3) of the Code may not be cured by a Loss of Value Payment.

 Section 2.11 Creation of REMIC I; Issuance of the REMIC I Regular Interests and the REMIC I Residual Interest; Certain Matters Involving REMIC I.



 (a) It is the intention of the parties hereto that the following segregated pool of assets constitute a REMIC for federal income tax purposes and, further, that such segregated pool of assets be designated as ''REMIC I'':  (i) the Mortgage Loans that are from time to time subject to this Agreement, together with (A) all payments under and proceeds of such Mortgage Loans received after the Closing Date (other than any Post-ARD Additional Interest) or, in the case of any such Mortgage Loan that is a Replacement Mortgage Loan, after the related date of substitution (other than scheduled payments of interest and principal due on or before the respective Cut-off Dates for such Mortgage Loans or, in the case of any such Mortgage Loan that is a Replacement Mortgage Loan, on or before the related date of substitution, and exclusive of any such amounts that constitute Excess Servicing Fees), and (B) all rights of the holder of such Mortgage Loans under the related Mortgage Loan Documents and in and to any related Additional Collateral; (ii) any REO Property acquired in respect of any Mortgage Loan (or, in the case of any REO Property related to a Non-Trust-Serviced Pooled Mortgage Loan, the beneficial interest of the holder of the related Mortgage Loan in such REO Property); (iii) such funds and assets as from time to time are deposited in the Collection Account (but not in the Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Custodial Account), the Distribution Account, the Interest Reserve Account, the Excess Liquidation Proceeds Account and, if established (but, in the case of any such account established with respect to a Serviced Loan Combination, subject to the rights of any Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder(s)), the REO Accounts (exclusive of any such amounts that constitute Excess Servicing Fees); and (iv) the rights of the Depositor under Sections 2, 3, 4 (other than Section 4(c), (d) and (f)) and 5 (other than Section 5(f), (g), (h) and (i)) (and, to the extent related to the foregoing, Sections 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17 and 18) of each Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement.  The Closing Date is hereby designated as the "Startup Day" of REMIC I within the meaning of Section 860G(a)(9) of the Code.



 (b) Concurrently with the assignment to the Trustee of the Original Mortgage Loans and certain related assets, pursuant to Section 2.01(b), and in exchange therefor, the REMIC I Regular Interests and the REMIC I Residual Interest shall be issued.  A single separate REMIC I Regular Interest shall be issued with respect to each Original Mortgage Loan.  For purposes of this Agreement each REMIC I Regular Interest shall relate to the Original Mortgage Loan in respect of which it was issued, to each Replacement Mortgage Loan (if any) substituted for such Original Mortgage Loan and to each REO Mortgage Loan deemed outstanding with respect to any REO Property acquired in respect of such Original Mortgage Loan or any such Replacement Mortgage Loan (or, in the case of any REO Property related to a Non-Trust-Serviced Pooled Mortgage Loan, the beneficial interest of the holder of the related Mortgage Loan in any related REO Property).  None of the REMIC I Regular Interests shall be certificated.  The REMIC I Regular Interests and the REMIC I Residual Interest shall collectively constitute the entire beneficial ownership of REMIC I.



 (c) The REMIC I Regular Interests shall constitute the "regular interests" (within the meaning of Section 860G(a)(1) of the Code), and the REMIC I Residual Interest shall constitute the sole "residual interest" (within the meaning of Section 860G(a)(2) of the Code), in REMIC I. None of the parties hereto, to the extent it is within the control thereof, shall create or







 permit the creation of any other "interests" in REMIC I (within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.860D-1(b)(1)).



 (d) The designation for each REMIC I Regular Interest shall be the identification number for the related Original Mortgage Loan set forth in the Mortgage Loan Schedule.



 (e) Each REMIC I Regular Interest shall have an Uncertificated Principal Balance.  As of the Closing Date, the Uncertificated Principal Balance of each REMIC I Regular Interest shall equal the Cut-off Date Principal Balance of the related Original Mortgage Loan (as specified in the Mortgage Loan Schedule).  On each Distribution Date, the Uncertificated Principal Balance of each REMIC I Regular Interest shall be permanently reduced by any distributions of principal deemed made with respect to such REMIC I Regular Interest on such Distribution Date pursuant to Section 4.01(j) and shall be further adjusted in the manner and to the extent provided in Section 4.04(c).  Except as provided in the preceding sentence and except to the extent of the recovery of amounts previously allocated as a Realized Loss as a result of the reimbursement from principal collections of Nonrecoverable Advances, the Uncertificated Principal Balance of each REMIC I Regular Interest shall not otherwise be increased or reduced.  Deemed distributions to REMIC II in reimbursement of any Realized Losses and Additional Trust Fund Expenses previously deemed allocated to a REMIC I Regular Interest, shall not constitute deemed distributions of principal and shall not result in any reduction of the Uncertificated Principal Balance of such REMIC I Regular Interest.



 (f) The per annum rate at which each REMIC I Regular Interest shall accrue interest during each Interest Accrual Period is herein referred to as its "REMIC I Remittance Rate."  The REMIC I Remittance Rate in respect of any particular REMIC I Regular Interest, for any Interest Accrual Period, shall equal:  (A) if the related Original Mortgage Loan is or was, as the case may be, a 30/360 Mortgage Loan, the related Net Mortgage Rate then in effect (including as a result of any step-up provision) for the related Original Mortgage Loan under the original terms of such Mortgage Loan in effect as of the Closing Date (without regard to any modifications, extensions, waivers or amendments of such Mortgage Loan subsequent to the Closing Date, whether entered into by the applicable Master Servicer or the applicable Special Servicer or in connection with any bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar proceeding involving the related Borrower) and (B) if the related Original Mortgage Loan is or was, as the case may be, an Actual/360 Mortgage Loan, a fraction (expressed as a percentage), the numerator of which is the product of 12 times the Adjusted Actual/360 Accrued Interest Amount with respect to such REMIC I Regular Interest for such Interest Accrual Period, and the denominator of which is the Uncertificated Principal Balance of such REMIC I Regular Interest immediately prior to the Distribution Date that corresponds to such Interest Accrual Period.



 The "Adjusted Actual/360 Accrued Interest Amount" with respect to any REMIC I Regular Interest referred to in clause (B) of the second sentence of the prior paragraph, for any Interest Accrual Period, is an amount of interest equal to the product of (a) the Net Mortgage Rate then in effect (including as a result of any step-up provision) for the related Mortgage Loan under the original terms of such Mortgage Loan in effect as of the Closing Date (without regard to any modifications, extensions, waivers or amendments of such Mortgage Loan subsequent to the Closing Date, whether entered into by the applicable Master Servicer or the applicable







 Special Servicer or in connection with any bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar proceeding involving the related Borrower), multiplied by (b) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in such Interest Accrual Period, and the denominator of which is 360, multiplied by (c) the Uncertificated Principal Balance of such REMIC I Regular Interest immediately prior to the Distribution Date that corresponds to such Interest Accrual Period; provided that, if the subject Interest Accrual Period occurs during (x) December of any year that does not immediately precede a leap year or (y) January of any year, then the amount of interest calculated with respect to the subject REMIC I Regular Interest pursuant to this definition for such Interest Accrual Period without regard to this proviso shall be decreased by the Interest Reserve Amount, if any (and the fraction described in clause (B) of the second sentence of the preceding paragraph shall be adjusted accordingly), with respect to the related Mortgage Loan (or any successor REO Mortgage Loan with respect thereto) transferred, in accordance with Section 3.04(c), from the Distribution Account to the Interest Reserve Account on the Master Servicer Remittance Date that occurs immediately following the end of such Interest Accrual Period; and provided, further, that, if the subject Interest Accrual Period occurs during February of any year (or during any December or January preceding the month of the Final Distribution Date), then the amount of interest calculated with respect to the subject REMIC I Regular Interest pursuant to this definition for such Interest Accrual Period without regard to this proviso shall be increased by the Interest Reserve Amount(s), if any (and the fraction described in clause (B) of the second sentence of the preceding paragraph shall be adjusted accordingly), with respect to the related Mortgage Loan (or any successor REO Mortgage Loan with respect thereto) transferred, in accordance with Section 3.05(c), from the Interest Reserve Account to the Distribution Account on the Master Servicer Remittance Date that occurs immediately following the end of such Interest Accrual Period.



 (g) Each REMIC I Regular Interest shall bear interest.  Such interest shall be calculated on a 30/360 Basis and, during each Interest Accrual Period, such interest shall accrue at the REMIC I Remittance Rate with respect to such REMIC I Regular Interest for such Interest Accrual Period on the Uncertificated Principal Balance of such REMIC I Regular Interest outstanding immediately prior to the related Distribution Date.  The total amount of interest accrued with respect to each REMIC I Regular Interest during each Interest Accrual Period is referred to herein as its "Uncertificated Accrued Interest" for such Interest Accrual Period.  The portion of the Uncertificated Accrued Interest with respect to any REMIC I Regular Interest for any Interest Accrual Period that shall be distributable to REMIC II, as the holder of such REMIC I Regular Interest, on the related Distribution Date pursuant to Section 4.01(j), shall be an amount (herein referred to as the "Uncertificated Distributable Interest" with respect to such REMIC I Regular Interest for the related Distribution Date) equal to (i) the Uncertificated Accrued Interest with respect to such REMIC I Regular Interest for the related Interest Accrual Period, reduced (to not less than zero) by (ii) the portion of any Net Aggregate Prepayment Interest Shortfall for such Distribution Date that is allocable to such REMIC I Regular Interest.  For purposes of the foregoing, the Net Aggregate Prepayment Interest Shortfall, if any, for each Distribution Date shall be allocated among all the REMIC I Regular Interests on a pro rata basis in accordance with their respective amounts of Uncertificated Accrued Interest for the related Interest Accrual Period.  If the entire Uncertificated Distributable Interest with respect to any REMIC I Regular Interest for any Distribution Date is not deemed distributed to REMIC II, as the holder of such REMIC I Regular Interest, on such Distribution Date pursuant to Section 4.01(j), then the unpaid portion of such Uncertificated Distributable Interest shall be







 distributable with respect to such REMIC I Regular Interest for future Distribution Dates as provided in such Section 4.01(j).



 (h) Solely for purposes of satisfying Treasury Regulations Section 1.860G-1(a)(4)(iii), the Latest Possible Maturity Date for each REMIC I Regular Interest shall be the date that is the Rated Final Distribution Date.



 (i) The REMIC I Residual Interest will not have a principal balance and will not bear interest.



 Section 2.12 Conveyance of the REMIC I Regular Interests; Acceptance of the REMIC I Regular Interests by Trustee.



 The Depositor, as of the Closing Date, and concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, does hereby assign without recourse all of its right, title and interest in and to the REMIC I Regular Interests to the Trustee for the benefit of the Holders of the Certificates (other than the Class V Certificates).

 Section 2.13 Creation of REMIC II; Issuance of the REMIC II Regular Interests and the REMIC II Residual Interest; Certain Matters Involving REMIC II.



 (a) It is the intention of the parties hereto that the segregated pool of assets consisting of the REMIC I Regular Interests constitute a REMIC for federal income tax purposes and, further, that such segregated pool of assets be designated as "REMIC II."  The Closing Date is hereby designated as the "Startup Day" of REMIC II within the meaning of Section 860G(a)(9) of the Code.



 (b) Concurrently with the assignment of the REMIC I Regular Interests to the Trustee pursuant to Section 2.12 and in exchange therefor, the REMIC II Regular Interests and the REMIC II Residual Interest shall be issued.  None of the REMIC II Regular Interests shall be certificated.  The REMIC II Regular Interests and the REMIC II Residual Interest shall collectively constitute the entire beneficial ownership of REMIC II.



 (c) The REMIC II Regular Interests shall constitute the "regular interests" (within the meaning of Section 860G(a)(1) of the Code), and the REMIC II Residual Interest shall constitute the sole "residual interest" (within the meaning of Section 860G(a)(2) of the Code), in REMIC II.  None of the parties hereto, to the extent it is within the control thereof, shall create or permit the creation of any other "interests" in REMIC II (within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.860D-1(b)(1)).



 (d) The REMIC II Regular Interests will have the alphabetic or alphanumeric designations indicated in the table set forth in the Preliminary Statement under the caption "REMIC II."







 (e) Each REMIC II Regular Interest shall have an Uncertificated Principal Balance.  As of the Closing Date, the Uncertificated Principal Balance of each REMIC II Regular Interest shall equal the amount set forth opposite such REMIC II Regular Interest in the table set forth in the Preliminary Statement under the caption "REMIC II."  On each Distribution Date, the Uncertificated Principal Balance of each REMIC II Regular Interest shall be permanently reduced by any distributions of principal deemed made with respect to such REMIC II Regular Interest on such Distribution Date pursuant to Section 4.01(i) and shall be further adjusted in the manner and to the extent provided in Section 4.04(b).  Except as provided in the preceding sentence and except to the extent of the recovery of amounts previously allocated as a Realized Loss as a result of the reimbursement from principal collections of Nonrecoverable Advances, the Uncertificated Principal Balance of each REMIC II Regular Interest shall not otherwise be increased or reduced.  Deemed distributions to REMIC III in reimbursement of any Realized Losses and Additional Trust Fund Expenses previously deemed allocated to a REMIC II Regular Interest, shall not constitute deemed distributions of principal and shall not result in any reduction of the Uncertificated Principal Balance of such REMIC II Regular Interest.



 (f) The per annum rate at which each REMIC II Regular Interest shall accrue interest during each Interest Accrual Period is herein referred to as its "REMIC II Remittance Rate."  The REMIC II Remittance Rate with respect to each REMIC II Regular Interest for any Interest Accrual Period shall be the WAC Rate for such Interest Accrual Period.

Such interest shall be calculated on a 30/360 Basis and, during each Interest Accrual Period, such interest shall accrue at the REMIC II Remittance Rate with respect to such REMIC II Regular Interest for such Interest Accrual Period on the Uncertificated Principal Balance of such REMIC II Regular Interest outstanding immediately prior to the related Distribution Date.  The total amount of interest accrued with respect to each REMIC II Regular Interest during each Interest Accrual Period is referred to herein as its "Uncertificated Accrued Interest" for such Interest Accrual Period.  The portion of the Uncertificated Accrued Interest with respect to any REMIC II Regular Interest for any Interest Accrual Period that shall be distributable to REMIC III, as the holder of such REMIC II Regular Interest, on the related Distribution Date pursuant to Section 4.01(i), shall be an amount (herein referred to as the "Uncertificated Distributable Interest" with respect to such REMIC II Regular Interest for the related Distribution Date) equal to (i) the Uncertificated Accrued Interest with respect to such REMIC II Regular Interest for the related Interest Accrual Period, reduced (to not less than zero) by (ii) the portion of any Net Aggregate Prepayment Interest Shortfall for such Distribution Date that is allocable to such REMIC II Regular Interest.  For purposes of the foregoing, the Net Aggregate Prepayment Interest Shortfall, if any, for each Distribution Date shall be allocated among all the REMIC II Regular Interests on a pro rata basis in accordance with their respective amounts of Uncertificated Accrued Interest for the related Interest Accrual Period.  If the entire Uncertificated Distributable Interest with respect to any REMIC II Regular Interest for any Distribution Date is not deemed distributed to REMIC III, as the holder of such REMIC II Regular Interest, on such Distribution Date pursuant to Section 4.01(i), then the unpaid portion of such Uncertificated Distributable Interest shall be distributable with respect to such REMIC II Regular Interest for future Distribution Dates as provided in such Section 4.01(i).

Distributions in reimbursement of the Holders of any such Class of Principal Balance Certificates or the Class A-S, Class B or Class C or PEX Certificates (in respect of the Class A-S, Class B or Class C Regular Interest, as applicable), for previously allocated Realized Losses and Additional Trust Fund Expenses shall not constitute distributions of principal and shall not result in any reduction of the Certificate Principal Balances of such Principal Balance Certificates or Class A-S, Class B or Class C Regular Interest or of the related Class Principal Balance of such Class of Principal Balance Certificate or Class A-S, Class B or Class C Regular Interest.



 The Interest Only Certificates shall not have principal balances.  For purposes of accruing interest, however, each Class of Interest Only Certificates shall have or be deemed to have a Class Notional Amount that is, as of any date of determination, equal to:  (i) in the case of the Class X-A Certificates, the total of the then Component Notional Amounts of the REMIC III Components of the Class X-A Certificates; and (ii) in the case of the Class X-B Certificates, the total of the then Component Notional Amounts of the REMIC III Components of the Class X-B Certificates.

 ADMINISTRATION AND SERVICING OF THE TRUST FUND



 Section 3.01 General Provisions.



 (a) Each of the Master Servicers and the Special Servicers shall service and administer the applicable Serviced Mortgage Loans, the Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan and any applicable Administered REO Properties that it is obligated (as provided below) to service and administer pursuant to this Agreement on behalf of the Trustee, and in the best interests and for the benefit of the Certificateholders (or, in the case of any Serviced Loan Combination, of the Certificateholders and the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder(s)) (as determined by the applicable Master Servicer or the applicable Special Servicer, as the case may be, in its good faith and reasonable judgment), as a collective whole, in accordance with any and all applicable laws, the terms of this Agreement, the terms of the respective Serviced Mortgage Loans and, in the case of any Serviced Loan Combination, the terms of the related Intercreditor Agreement (provided that, in the event the applicable Master Servicer or the applicable Special Servicer, as applicable, in its reasonably exercised judgment determines that following the terms of any Mortgage Loan Document would or potentially would result in an Adverse REMIC Event (for which determination, the applicable Master Servicer and the applicable Special Servicer will be entitled to rely on advice of counsel, the cost of which will be reimbursed as an Additional Trust Fund Expense by withdrawal from the Collection Account), the applicable Master Servicer or the applicable Special Servicer, as applicable, must comply with the REMIC Provisions to the extent necessary to avoid an Adverse REMIC Event) and, to the extent consistent with the foregoing, in accordance with the Servicing Standard.  The General Master Servicer shall be the Master Servicer, and the General Special Servicer shall be the Special Servicer, in each case with respect to all the Mortgage Loans (other than the NCB, FSB Mortgage Loans), any Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan and other related assets in the Trust and, as such, shall service and administer such Mortgage Loans, any Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan and such other assets as shall be required of the applicable Master Servicer or the applicable Special Servicer, as applicable, hereunder and under any related Intercreditor Agreement. The NCB Master Servicer shall be the Master Servicer with respect to the NCB, FSB Mortgage Loans and other related assets in the Trust and, as such, shall service and administer such NCB, FSB Mortgage Loans and such other assets as shall be required of the Master Servicer hereunder. For purposes of this Agreement and any references to the duties and obligations of the Master Servicers or Special Servicers, any references to Mortgage Loans in the context of such duties and/or obligations shall be deemed to refer solely to the Mortgage Loans serviced by the applicable Master Servicer or applicable Special Servicer and no other Mortgage Loan, Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan or other related asset in the Trust serviced hereunder, unless specifically indicated otherwise.  In clarification of, and neither in addition to nor in deletion of the duties and obligations of the applicable Master Servicer or the applicable Special Servicer pursuant to this Agreement, no provision herein contained shall be construed as an express or implied guarantee by the applicable Master Servicer or the applicable Special Servicer of the collectability or recoverability of payments on the Mortgage Loans or any Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loans or shall be construed to impair or adversely affect any rights or benefits provided by this Agreement to the applicable Master Servicer or the applicable Special Servicer (including with respect to Master Servicing Fees or the right to be reimbursed







 for Advances).  Any provision in this Agreement for any Advance by the applicable Master Servicer, the applicable Special Servicer or the Trustee is intended solely to provide liquidity for the benefit of the Certificateholders and, if applicable, any Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder(s), and not as credit support or otherwise to impose on any such Person the risk of loss with respect to one or more of the Mortgage Loans.  No provision hereof shall be construed to impose liability on the applicable Master Servicer or the applicable Special Servicer for the reason that any recovery to the Certificateholders (or, in the case of any Serviced Loan Combination, to the Certificateholders and the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder(s)) in respect of a Mortgage Loan at any time after a determination of present value recovery made in its reasonable and good faith judgment in accordance with the Servicing Standard by the applicable Master Servicer or applicable Special Servicer hereunder at any time is less than the amount reflected in such determination.  Without limiting the foregoing, and subject to Section 3.21, (i) the applicable Master Servicer shall service and administer all related Performing Serviced Mortgage Loans and related Performing Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan, (ii) the applicable Special Servicer shall service and administer (x) each Serviced Mortgage Loan and each Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan (other than Corrected Mortgage Loans) as to which a Servicing Transfer Event has occurred, and (y) each Administered REO Property; provided, that the applicable Master Servicer shall continue to (A) make P&I Advances required hereunder with respect to each related Mortgage Loan that constitutes a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan and each related successor REO Mortgage Loan in respect thereof, (B) make Servicing Advances required hereunder with respect to any related Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans and Administered REO Properties (and related REO Mortgage Loans), (C) receive payments, collect information and deliver reports to the Certificate Administrator and the Trustee required hereunder with respect to any related Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans and Administered REO Properties (and the related REO Mortgage Loans), and (D) render such incidental services with respect to any related Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans and Administered REO Properties as and to the extent as may be specifically provided for herein.  In addition, the applicable Master Servicer shall notify the applicable Special Servicer within three (3) Business Days following its receipt of any collections on any Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan or REO Mortgage Loan, the applicable Special Servicer shall within one Business Day thereafter notify the applicable Master Servicer with instructions on how to apply such collections and the applicable Master Servicer shall apply such collections in accordance with such instructions within one Business Day following the applicable Master Servicer's receipt of such notice.



 (b) Subject to Section 3.01(a) and the other terms and provisions of this Agreement, the applicable Master Servicer and the applicable Special Servicer shall each have full power and authority, acting alone or, subject to Section 3.22, through Sub-Servicers, to do or cause to be done any and all things in connection with such servicing and administration which it may deem necessary or desirable.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the applicable Master Servicer (with respect to those Serviced Mortgage Loans and Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan that it is obligated to service and administer pursuant to this Agreement) and the applicable Special Servicer (with respect to (x) Special Servicer Decisions and Material Actions on those Serviced Mortgage Loans and Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan that it is obligated to process pursuant to this Agreement and (y) the Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans and Administered REO Properties), in its own name or in the name of the Trustee, is hereby authorized and empowered by the Trustee (and in the case of any Serviced Loan Combination is,







 pursuant to the related Intercreditor Agreement, authorized by the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder) to execute and deliver, on behalf of the Certificateholders, the Trustee (and in the case of any Serviced Loan Combination), the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder, or any of them:  (i) any and all financing statements, continuation statements and other documents or instruments necessary to maintain the lien created by the Mortgage or other security document in the related Mortgage File on the related Mortgaged Property and other related collateral; (ii) any and all instruments of satisfaction or cancellation, or of partial or full release or discharge, or of partial or full defeasance, and all other comparable instruments; and (iii) subject to Sections 3.08, 3.20 and 3.24) any and all assumptions, modifications, waivers, substitutions, extensions, amendments, consents to transfers of interests in Borrowers, consents to any subordinate financings to be secured by any related Mortgaged Property, consents to any mezzanine financing to be secured by ownership interests in a Borrower, consents to and monitoring of the application of any proceeds of insurance policies or condemnation awards to the restoration of the related Mortgaged Property or otherwise, consents to other matters that pursuant to the applicable Mortgage Loan Documents require the consent of the holder of the Mortgage, documents relating to the management, operation, maintenance, repair, leasing and marketing of the related Mortgaged Properties (including agreements and requests by any Borrower with respect to modifications of the standards of operation and management of the Mortgaged Properties or the replacement of asset managers), documents exercising any or all of the rights, powers and privileges granted or provided to the holder of any Serviced Mortgage Loan under the related Mortgage Loan Documents, lease subordination agreements, non-disturbance and attornment agreements or other leasing or rental arrangements that may be requested by any Borrower or its tenants, documents granting, modifying or releasing (or joining the Borrower therein) any easements, covenants, conditions, restrictions, equitable servitudes, or land use or zoning requirements with respect to the Mortgaged Properties, instruments relating to the custody of any collateral that now secures or hereafter may secure any Serviced Mortgage Loan and any other consents.  Subject to Section 3.10, the Trustee shall, at the written request of a Servicing Officer of the applicable Master Servicer or the applicable Special Servicer, furnish, or cause to be so furnished, to the applicable Master Servicer or the applicable Special Servicer, as the case may be, any limited powers of attorney substantially in the forms attached as Exhibit L-1 or Exhibit L-2 hereto (or such other form as mutually agreed to by the Trustee and the applicable Master Servicer or Special Servicer, as applicable) and other documents (each of which shall be prepared by the applicable Master Servicer or the applicable Special Servicer, as the case may be) necessary or appropriate to enable it to carry out its servicing and administrative duties hereunder; provided that the Trustee shall not be held liable for any misuse of any such power of attorney by the applicable Master Servicer or the applicable Special Servicer.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Trustee shall execute and deliver to the applicable Master Servicer and the applicable Special Servicer, on or before the Closing Date, a power of attorney substantially in the forms attached as Exhibit L-1 or Exhibit L-2 hereto, as applicable (or such other form as mutually agreed to by the Trustee and the applicable Master Servicer or the applicable Special Servicer, as applicable).  Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, neither the applicable Master Servicer nor the applicable Special Servicer shall, without the Trustee's written consent:  (i) initiate any action, suit or proceeding solely under the Trustee's name without indicating the applicable Master Servicer's or the applicable Special Servicer's, as applicable, representative capacity; provided, however, that in those jurisdictions in which the foregoing requirement would not be legally







 or procedurally permissible, the applicable Master Servicer or the applicable Special Servicer, as applicable, shall provide five (5) Business Days' prior notice to the Trustee of the initiation of such action, suit or proceeding (or provide such prior notice as the applicable Master Servicer or the applicable Special Servicer, as applicable, shall determine in its reasonable judgment exercised in accordance with the Servicing Standard, to be reasonably practicable prior to filing such action, suit or proceeding) (and shall not be required to obtain the Trustee's written consent or indicate the applicable Master Servicer's or the applicable Special Servicer's, as applicable, representative capacity); or (ii) take any action with the intent to cause, and that actually causes, the Trustee to be registered to do business in any state.  The applicable Master Servicer and the applicable Special Servicer shall indemnify (out of its own funds without reimbursement therefor) the Trustee for any and all costs, liabilities and expenses incurred by the Trustee in connection with the negligent or willful misuse of such power of attorney by the applicable Master Servicer or the applicable Special Servicer, as the case may be.



 (c) The applicable Master Servicer or the applicable Special Servicer, as the case may be, in accordance with this Agreement, shall service and administer each Cross-Collateralized Group as a single Mortgage Loan as and when necessary and appropriate consistent with the Servicing Standard and applicable law and in accordance with this Agreement.



 (d) The relationship of the applicable Master Servicer and the applicable Special Servicer to the Trustee and, unless they are the same Person, one another under this Agreement is intended by the parties to be that of an independent contractor and not that of a joint venturer, partner or agent.



 (e) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the parties hereto acknowledge and agree that each of the applicable Master Servicer's and the applicable Special Servicer's obligations and responsibilities hereunder and the applicable Master Servicer's and the applicable Special Servicer's authority with respect to the Non-Serviced Loan Combinations and any REO Property that is not an Administered REO Property is limited by and subject to the terms of the related Intercreditor Agreements and the rights, responsibilities and obligations of the Non-Trust Master Servicer, the Non-Trust Special Servicer and the Non-Trust Trustee under the Non-Trust Pooling and Servicing Agreement.  The applicable Master Servicer shall, to the extent directed and instructed as contemplated by Section 3.01(g), enforce the rights of the Trustee (as holder of each Non-Trust-Serviced Pooled Mortgage Loan) under the related Intercreditor Agreement and the Non-Trust Pooling and Servicing Agreement.



 (f) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall limit the ability of the applicable Master Servicer or applicable Special Servicer to lend money to (to the extent not secured, in whole or in part, by any Mortgaged Property, except, in the case of a Co-op Mortgage Loan, any such indebtedness as to which the NCB, FSB Subordinate Debt Conditions have been satisfied, which indebtedness may be secured by a lien on the related Mortgaged Property), accept deposits from and otherwise generally engage in any kind of business or dealings with any Borrower as though the applicable Master Servicer or the applicable Special Servicer was not a party to this Agreement or to the transactions contemplated hereby; provided that this sentence shall not be construed to modify or supersede the Servicing Standard.







 (g) The parties hereto acknowledge that each Non-Trust-Serviced Pooled Mortgage Loan and any REO Property that is not an Administered REO Property is subject to the terms and conditions of the related Intercreditor Agreement and the related Non-Trust Pooling and Servicing Agreement.  The parties hereto recognize the respective rights and obligations of the "Initial Note Holders" and "Note Holders" under the Intercreditor Agreements for such Non-Trust-Serviced Pooled Mortgage Loans, including with respect to the allocation of collections and losses on or in respect of such Non-Trust-Serviced Pooled Mortgage Loans and the related Non-Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan and the making of payments to the "Initial Note Holders" and "Note Holders" in accordance with each such Intercreditor Agreement and the related Non-Trust Pooling and Servicing Agreement.  The parties hereto further acknowledge that, pursuant to the related Intercreditor Agreement(s) for each Non-Trust-Serviced Pooled Mortgage Loan and any REO Property that is not an Administered REO Property, each Non-Trust-Serviced Pooled Mortgage Loan, the related Non-Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan and any REO Property that is not an Administered REO Property are to be serviced and administered by the related Non-Trust Master Servicer and related Non-Trust Special Servicer in accordance with the related Non-Trust Pooling and Servicing Agreement.  Although each Non-Trust-Serviced Pooled Mortgage Loan is not a Serviced Mortgage Loan hereunder, the applicable Master Servicer hereunder for each such Non-Trust-Serviced Pooled Mortgage Loan shall have certain duties as set forth herein and shall constitute the "Master Servicer" hereunder with respect to each such Non-Trust-Serviced Pooled Mortgage Loan.  The applicable Special Servicer shall have no obligations under this Agreement for servicing any Non-Serviced Loan Combinations or related REO Property.



 With respect to any Non-Trust-Serviced Pooled Mortgage Loan, the parties to this Agreement shall have no obligation or authority to supervise respective parties to the Non-Trust Pooling and Servicing Agreement (but this statement shall not relieve them of liabilities they may otherwise have in their capacities as parties to the Non-Trust Pooling and Servicing Agreement) or to make Servicing Advances with respect to any such Non-Trust-Serviced Pooled Mortgage Loan.  If there are at any time amounts due from the Trust, as holder of a Non-Trust-Serviced Pooled Mortgage Loan, to any party under the related Intercreditor Agreement or the related Non-Trust Pooling and Servicing Agreement pursuant to the terms thereof, the applicable Master Servicer shall notify the applicable Special Servicer and the Subordinate Class Representative, and the applicable Master Servicer shall pay such amounts out of the related Collection Account.  Except as otherwise expressly addressed in Section 3.20, if a party to the Non-Trust Pooling and Servicing Agreement related to a Non-Trust-Serviced Pooled Mortgage Loan requests the Trustee to consent to a modification, waiver or amendment of, or other loan-level action related to, such Non-Trust-Serviced Pooled Mortgage Loan, then the Trustee shall promptly deliver a copy of such request to the applicable Master Servicer to be addressed by the applicable Master Servicer pursuant to Section 3.20(g); provided that, if such Non-Trust-Serviced Pooled Mortgage Loan were serviced hereunder and such action would not be permitted without Rating Agency Confirmation, then the applicable Master Servicer shall not grant such direction without first having obtained such Rating Agency Confirmation (payable at the expense of the party requesting such approval of the Trustee, if a Certificateholder or a party to this Agreement, otherwise from the Collection Account).  If a Responsible Officer of the Trustee receives actual notice of a "servicer termination event" (or other similar term) under the related Non-Trust Pooling and Servicing Agreement, then (during any Subordinate Control Period or Collective Consultation Period) the Trustee shall notify (in writing), and direct the







  applicable Master Servicer to act in accordance with the instructions of, the Subordinate Class Representative; provided that, during a Senior Consultation Period, or if such instructions are not provided within a reasonable time period (not to exceed ten (10) Business Days or such lesser response time as is afforded under the related Non-Trust Pooling and Servicing Agreement), or if the applicable Master Servicer is not permitted by the Non-Trust Pooling and Servicing Agreement to follow such instructions, then the Trustee shall direct the applicable Master Servicer to take such action or inaction (to the extent permitted by the Non-Trust Pooling and Servicing Agreement), as directed in writing by the Holders of the Certificates entitled to a majority of the Voting Rights (such direction communicated to the applicable Master Servicer by the Trustee) within a reasonable period of time that does not exceed such response time as is afforded under the related Non-Trust Pooling and Servicing Agreement.  If the Trustee receives a request from any party to a Non-Trust Pooling and Servicing Agreement for consent to or approval of a modification, waiver or amendment of such Non-Trust Pooling and Servicing Agreement and/or the related Intercreditor Agreement, or the adoption of any servicing agreement that is the successor to and/or in replacement of such Non-Trust Pooling and Servicing Agreement in effect as of the Closing Date or a change in servicer under such Non-Trust Pooling and Servicing Agreement, then the Trustee shall not grant such consent or approval unless it receives the consent of the applicable Master Servicer under this Agreement, the consent of the Subordinate Class Representative (during any Subordinate Control Period or Collective Consultation Period) and a Rating Agency Confirmation (at the expense of the party requesting such approval of the Trustee, if a Certificateholder or a party to this Agreement, otherwise from the Collection Account) from each Rating Agency to the effect that such consent or approval would not result in an Adverse Rating Event with respect to any Class of Rated Certificates.  During the continuation of any "servicer termination event" (or other similar term) under a Non-Trust Pooling and Servicing Agreement, each of the Trustee, the applicable Master Servicer and the applicable Special Servicer shall have the right (but not the obligation) to take all actions to enforce its rights and remedies and to protect the interests, and enforce the rights and remedies, of the Trust (including the institution and prosecution of all judicial, administrative and other proceedings and the filings of proofs of claim and debt in connection therewith).  The reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the applicable Master Servicer or the applicable Special Servicer in connection with such enforcement shall be an Additional Trust Fund Expense.  The Trustee, the applicable Master Servicer and the applicable Special Servicer shall each promptly forward all material notices or other communications delivered to it in connection with each Non-Trust Pooling and Servicing Agreement to the other such parties, the Depositor and the Subordinate Class Representative and, if such notice or communication is in the nature of a notice or communication that would be required to be delivered to the Rating Agencies if the related Non-Trust-Serviced Pooled Mortgage Loan were a Serviced Mortgage Loan, to the Rule 17g-5 Information Provider (who shall promptly post such notice to the Rule 17g-5 Information Provider's Website in accordance with Section 8.12(c)).  Any obligation of the applicable Master Servicer or the applicable Special Servicer, as applicable, to provide information and collections to the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator and the Certificateholders with respect to any Non-Trust-Serviced Pooled Mortgage Loan shall be dependent on its receipt of the corresponding information and collections from the related Non-Trust Master Servicer or the related Non-Trust Special Servicer.







 (h) With respect to each Non-Trust-Serviced Pooled Mortgage Loan, the parties to this Agreement agree as follows:



 (i) the Trust shall be responsible for its pro rata share of any "Nonrecoverable Servicing Advances" (as defined in the related Non-Trust Pooling and Servicing Agreement) (and advance interest thereon) and any "Additional Trust Fund Expenses" (as defined in the related Non-Trust Pooling and Servicing Agreement), but only to the extent that they relate to servicing and administration of the related Non-Serviced Loan Combination, including without limitation, any unpaid "Special Servicing Fees," "Liquidation Fees" and "Workout Fees" (each, as defined in the related Non-Trust Pooling and Servicing Agreement) relating to the related Non-Serviced Loan Combination, and that if the funds received with respect to the related Non-Serviced Loan Combination are insufficient to cover "Servicing Advances" or "Additional Trust Fund Expenses" (each as defined in the related Non-Trust Pooling and Servicing Agreement), (i) the applicable Master Servicer shall, promptly following notice from the Non-Trust Master Servicer, reimburse the Non-Trust Master Servicer, the Non-Trust Special Servicer, the Non-Trust Certificate Administrator or the Non-Trust Trustee, as applicable (such reimbursement, to the extent owed to the Non-Trust Special Servicer, the Non-Trust Certificate Administrator or the Non-Trust Trustee, may be paid by the applicable Master Servicer to the Non-Trust Master Servicer, who shall pay such amounts to the Non-Trust Special Servicer, the Non-Trust Certificate Administrator or the Non-Trust Trustee, as applicable), out of general collections in either Collection Account for the Trust's pro rata share of any such "Nonrecoverable Servicing Advances" and/or "Additional Trust Fund Expenses," and (ii) if the related Non-Trust Pooling and Servicing Agreement permits the Non-Trust Master Servicer, the Non-Trust Special Servicer, the Non-Trust Certificate Administrator or the Non-Trust Trustee to reimburse itself from the related trust's general collections, then the parties to this Agreement hereby acknowledge and agree that the Non-Trust Master Servicer, the Non-Trust Special Servicer, the Non-Trust Certificate Administrator or the Non-Trust Trustee, as applicable, may do so and the applicable Master Servicer shall be required to, promptly following notice from the Non-Trust Master Servicer, reimburse the related trust out of general collections in the Collection Accounts for the Trust's pro rata share of any such "Nonrecoverable Servicing Advances" and/or "Additional Trust Fund Expenses";



 (ii) each of the Indemnified Parties (as defined in each Intercreditor Agreement) shall be indemnified (as and to the same extent the related trust established pursuant to the related Non-Trust Pooling and Servicing Agreement is required to indemnify each of such Indemnified Parties in respect of other mortgage loans in such trust pursuant to the terms of the related Non-Trust Pooling and Servicing Agreement) by the Trust, against any of the Indemnified Items (as defined in each Intercreditor Agreement) to the extent of the Trust's pro rata share of such Indemnified Items, and to the extent amounts on deposit in the "Pari Passu Companion Loan Custodial Account" (as such term or other similar term is defined in the related Non-Trust Pooling and Servicing Agreement) are insufficient for reimbursement of such amounts, the Master Servicers shall, promptly following notice from the Non-Trust Master Servicer, reimburse each of the applicable Indemnified Parties for the Trust's pro rata share of the insufficiency out of general funds in the Collection Accounts;







 (iii) the Certificate Administrator shall deliver to the Non-Trust Trustee, the Non-Trust Certificate Administrator, the Non-Trust Special Servicer, the Non-Trust Master Servicer and the Non-Trust Trust Advisor (with a copy to be sent to the applicable Master Servicer and the applicable Special Servicer) (A) promptly following its receipt of notice of the Brunswick Square Pari Passu Companion Loan Securitization Date, written notice in the form of Exhibit U attached hereto, stating that, as of the Closing Date, the Trustee is the holder of such Non-Trust-Serviced Pooled Mortgage Loan and directing each such recipient to remit to the applicable Master Servicer all amounts payable to, and to forward, deliver or otherwise make available, as the case may be, to the applicable Master Servicer all reports, statements, documents, communications and other information that are to be forwarded, delivered or otherwise made available to, the holder of such Non-Trust-Serviced Pooled Mortgage Loan under the related Intercreditor Agreement and the Non-Trust Pooling and Servicing Agreement (which notice shall also provide contact information for the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator, the applicable Master Servicer, the applicable Special Servicer and the party designated to exercise the rights of the "Non-Controlling Note Holder" under each Intercreditor Agreement), and (B) notice of any subsequent change in the identity of the applicable Master Servicer or the party designated to exercise the rights of the "Non-Controlling Note Holder" under each Intercreditor Agreement (together with the relevant contact information); and



 (iv) the Non-Trust Master Servicer, the Non-Trust Special Servicer and the related trust established pursuant to the related Non-Trust Pooling and Servicing Agreement shall be third-party beneficiaries of this Section 3.01(h).



 (i) In the event that any Mortgage Loan included in any Serviced Loan Combination is no longer part of the Trust Fund, such Mortgage Loan and the related Serviced Loan Combination shall continue to be serviced and administered under this Agreement by the applicable Master Servicer and the applicable Special Servicer until a successor servicing agreement, acceptable to the parties thereto, is entered into with the consent of the holder of such Mortgage Loan and the related Pari Passu Companion Loan; provided, however, that, as of the time such Mortgage Loan is no longer part of the Trust Fund, such Serviced Loan Combination and the related Mortgaged Property shall be serviced for the benefit of the holders of such Serviced Loan Combination as if they were the sole assets serviced and administered hereunder, and the sole source of funds hereunder (other than with respect to the reimbursement of Nonrecoverable Advances made while such Mortgage Loan was part of the Trust Fund) and that there shall be no further obligation of any Person to make P&I Advances.  The Master Servicing Fee, the Special Servicing Fee, the Liquidation Fee and/or the Workout Fee with respect to such Serviced Loan Combination shall continue to be calculated based on the entire principal amount of such Serviced Loan Combination.  All amounts due the applicable Master Servicer and the applicable Special Servicer (including Advances and interest thereon) pursuant to this Agreement and the applicable Co-Lender Agreement shall be paid to the applicable Master Servicer and the applicable Special Servicer on the first Master Servicer Remittance Date following removal of the Mortgage Loan from the Trust Fund and any related Master Servicer Remittance Date thereafter.  In addition, until such time as a separate servicing agreement with respect to such Serviced Loan Combination and any related REO Property has been entered into, notwithstanding that neither such Mortgage Loan nor any related REO Property is part of the Trust Fund, the Custodian shall continue to hold the Mortgage File.







 Section 3.02 Collection of Mortgage Loan Payments.



 (a) Each of the applicable Master Servicer and the applicable Special Servicer shall make efforts consistent with the Servicing Standard and the terms of this Agreement to collect all payments required under the terms and provisions of any Serviced Mortgage Loans and Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan it is obligated to service hereunder (including, without limitation, all Special Servicing Fees, Workout Fees, Liquidation Fees and other fees and compensation payable to the applicable Master Servicer and to the applicable Special Servicer to the extent the Borrower is obligated to pay such amounts pursuant to the related Mortgage Loan Documents); and shall follow such collection procedures as are consistent with the Servicing Standard; provided that the applicable Master Servicer shall not, with respect to any Mortgage Loan that constitutes an ARD Mortgage Loan after its Anticipated Repayment Date, take any enforcement action with respect to the payment of Post-ARD Additional Interest (other than the making of requests for its collection), and the applicable Special Servicer may do so only if (A) such Mortgage Loan is a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan and (B) either (i) the taking of an enforcement action with respect to the payment of other amounts due under such Mortgage Loan is, in the reasonable judgment of such Special Servicer, and without regard to such Post-ARD Additional Interest, also necessary, appropriate and consistent with the Servicing Standard or (ii) all other amounts due under such Mortgage Loan have been paid, the payment of such Post-ARD Additional Interest has not been forgiven in accordance with Section 3.20 and, in the reasonable judgment of the applicable Special Servicer, exercised in accordance with the Servicing Standard, the Liquidation Proceeds expected to be recovered in connection with such enforcement action will cover the anticipated costs of such enforcement action and, if applicable, any associated Post-ARD Additional Interest; provided, that the applicable Master Servicer or the applicable Special Servicer, as the case may be, may take action to enforce the Trust Fund's right to apply excess cash flow to principal in accordance with the terms of the related Mortgage Loan Documents.  Consistent with the foregoing, the applicable Master Servicer or the applicable Special Servicer may grant case-by-case waivers of Default Charges in connection with a late payment on a Mortgage Loan or Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan.

 Section 3.03 Collection of Taxes, Assessments and Similar Items; Servicing Accounts; Reserve Accounts.



 (a) Each Master Servicer shall establish and maintain one or more segregated accounts ("Servicing Accounts"), in which all Escrow Payments received by it with respect to any Serviced Mortgage Loans or Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan, shall be deposited and retained, separate and apart from its own funds.  Subject to any terms of the related Mortgage Loan Documents that specify the nature of the account in which Escrow Payments shall be held, each Servicing Account shall be an Eligible Account.  As and to the extent consistent with the Servicing Standard, applicable law and the related Mortgage Loan Documents, the applicable Master Servicer may make withdrawals from the Servicing Accounts maintained by it, and may apply Escrow Payments held therein with respect to any Serviced Mortgage Loan or Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan (together with interest earned thereon), only as follows:  (i) to effect the payment of real estate taxes, assessments, insurance premiums (including, premiums on any Environmental Insurance Policy), ground rents (if applicable) and comparable items in respect of the related Mortgaged Property; (ii) to reimburse the applicable Master Servicer, the applicable Special Servicer or the Trustee, as applicable, for any unreimbursed Servicing Advances made thereby with respect to such Mortgage Loan or Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan to cover any of the items described in the immediately preceding clause (i); (iii) to refund to the related Borrower any sums as may be determined to be overages; (iv) to pay interest or other income, if required and as described below, to the related Borrower on balances in the Servicing Account (or, if and to the extent not payable to the related Borrower to pay such interest or other income (up to the amount of any Net Investment Earnings in respect of such Servicing Account for each Collection Period) to the applicable Master Servicer); (v) disburse Insurance Proceeds if required to be applied to the repair or restoration of the related Mortgaged Property, (vi) after an event of default, to pay the principal of, accrued interest on and any other amounts payable with respect to such Mortgage Loan or Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan; (vii) to withdraw amounts deposited in the Servicing Account in error; or (viii) to clear and terminate the Servicing Account at the termination of this Agreement in accordance with Section 9.01.  The applicable Master Servicer shall pay or cause to be paid to the related Borrowers interest and other income, if any, earned on the investment of funds in Servicing Accounts maintained thereby, if and to the extent required by law or the terms of the related Mortgage Loan Documents.  If a Master Servicer shall deposit in a Servicing Account maintained by it any amount not required to be deposited therein, it may at any time withdraw such amount from such Servicing Account, any provision herein to the contrary notwithstanding.  Promptly after any Escrow Payments are received by the applicable Special Servicer from the Borrower under any Serviced Mortgage Loan or Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan, and in any event within one Business Day after any such receipt, such Special Servicer shall remit such Escrow Payments to the applicable Master Servicer for deposit in the applicable Servicing Account(s).



 (b) The applicable Master Servicer shall as to each related Serviced Mortgage Loan or Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan (including each Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan):  (i) maintain accurate records with respect to the related Mortgaged Property reflecting the status of real estate taxes, assessments and other similar items that are or may become a lien thereon and the status of insurance premiums and any ground rents payable in respect thereof and (ii) use reasonable efforts consistent with the Servicing Standard to obtain, from time to time, all bills for the payment of such items (including renewal premiums) and effect payment







 thereof prior to the applicable penalty or termination date.  For purposes of effecting any such payment with respect to any Serviced Mortgage Loan or Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan, the applicable Master Servicer shall apply Escrow Payments as allowed under the terms of the related Mortgage Loan Documents; provided that if such Mortgage Loan or Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan does not require the related Borrower to escrow for the payment of real estate taxes, assessments, insurance premiums, ground rents (if applicable) and similar items, the applicable Master Servicer (or, if such Mortgage Loan or Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan becomes a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan, the applicable Special Servicer) shall, subject to and in accordance with the Servicing Standard, use reasonable efforts to enforce the requirement of the related Mortgage Loan Documents that the related Borrower make payments in respect of such items at the time they first become due.



 (c) In accordance with the Servicing Standard, but subject to Section 3.11(h), the applicable Master Servicer, with respect to each related Serviced Mortgage Loan or Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan (including each such Mortgage Loan or Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan that is a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan) shall make a Servicing Advance with respect to the related Mortgaged Property in an amount equal to all such funds as are necessary for the purpose of effecting the timely payment of (i) real estate taxes, assessments and other similar items, (ii) ground rents (if applicable), and (iii) premiums on Insurance Policies (including, premiums on any Environmental Insurance Policy), in each instance prior to the applicable penalty or termination date, in each instance if and to the extent that (x) Escrow Payments (if any) collected from the related Borrower are insufficient to pay such item when due, and (y) the related Borrower has failed to pay such item on a timely basis; provided that, in the case of amounts described in the preceding clause (i), the applicable Master Servicer shall not make a Servicing Advance of any such amount if such Master Servicer reasonably anticipates (in accordance with the Servicing Standard) that such amounts will be paid by the related Borrower on or before the applicable penalty date, in which case the applicable Master Servicer shall use efforts consistent with the Servicing Standard to confirm whether such amounts have been paid and, subject to Section 3.11(h), shall make a Servicing Advance of such amounts, if necessary, not later than five (5) Business Days following confirmation by the applicable Master Servicer that such amounts have not been paid by the applicable penalty date.  All such Advances shall be reimbursable in the first instance from related collections from the Borrowers and further as provided in Section 3.05(a).  No costs incurred by the applicable Master Servicer in effecting the payment of real estate taxes, assessments and, if applicable, ground rents on or in respect of any Mortgaged Property shall, for purposes hereof, including calculating monthly distributions to Certificateholders, be added to the respective unpaid principal balances or Stated Principal Balances of the subject Mortgage Loan or Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan, notwithstanding that the terms of such Mortgage Loan or Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan so permit; provided that this sentence shall not be construed to limit the rights of the applicable Master Servicer or the applicable Special Servicer on behalf of the Trust to enforce any obligations of the related Borrower under such Mortgage Loan.



 (d) Each Master Servicer shall establish and maintain one or more segregated accounts ("Reserve Accounts"), in which all Reserve Funds, if any, received by it with respect to the related Serviced Mortgage Loans or Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan, shall be deposited and retained, separate and apart from its own funds.  Subject to any terms of the related Mortgage Loan Documents that specify the nature of the account in which Reserve Funds shall







 be held, each Reserve Account shall be an Eligible Account.  As and to the extent consistent with the Servicing Standard, applicable law and the related Mortgage Loan Documents, the applicable Master Servicer may make withdrawals from the Reserve Accounts maintained by it, and may apply Reserve Funds held therein with respect to any Serviced Mortgage Loan or Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan (together with interest earned thereon), only as follows:  (i) in the case of Reserve Funds that are intended to cover specific costs and expenses, to pay for, or to reimburse the related Borrower in connection with, the costs associated with the related tenant improvements, leasing commissions, repairs, replacements, capital improvements and/or environmental testing and remediation, litigation and/or other special expenses at or with respect to the related Mortgaged Property for which such Reserve Funds were intended and to refund the related Borrower any sums as may be determined to be overages; (ii) in the case of Reserve Funds intended to cover debt service payments, to apply amounts on deposit therein in respect of principal and interest on such Mortgage Loan or Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan; (iii) to reimburse the applicable Master Servicer, the applicable Special Servicer or the Trustee, as applicable, for any unreimbursed Advances made thereby with respect to such Mortgage Loan or Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan to cover any of the items described in the immediately preceding clauses (i) and (ii) (or, if any such Advance has become an Unliquidated Advance, to transfer to the Collection Account an amount equal to the reimbursement that would otherwise have been made as described in this clause (iii)); (iv) subject to Section 3.20, to release such Reserve Funds to the related Borrower if the conditions precedent for such release are satisfied or otherwise apply such Reserve Funds in accordance with the related Mortgage Loan Documents if the conditions precedent for such release are not satisfied; (v) to pay interest or other income, if required and as described below, to the related Borrower on balances in the Reserve Account (or, if and to the extent not payable to the related Borrower, to pay such interest or other income (up to the amount of any Net Investment Earnings in respect of such Reserve Account for each Collection Period) to the applicable Master Servicer); (vi) to withdraw amounts deposited in such Reserve Account in error; (vii) after an event of default, to pay the principal of, accrued interest on, and any other amounts payable with respect to such Mortgage Loan or Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan; or (viii) to clear and terminate the Reserve Account at the termination of this Agreement in accordance with Section 9.01.  If the Borrower under any Serviced Mortgage Loan or Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan delivers a Letter of Credit in lieu of Reserve Funds, then the applicable Master Servicer, subject to Section 3.20, shall make draws on or reduce the amount of such Letter of Credit at such times and for such purposes as it would have made withdrawals from or reductions of the amount of a Reserve Account and, to the extent consistent with the Servicing Standard, applicable law and the related Mortgage Loan Documents, in order to convert the amount of such Letter of Credit into Reserve Funds.  Promptly after any Reserve Funds are received by the applicable Special Servicer from any Borrower, and in any event within one Business Day of such receipt, the applicable Special Servicer shall remit such Reserve Funds to the applicable Master Servicer for deposit in the applicable Reserve Account(s).  Any out-of-pocket expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses, incurred by the applicable Master Servicer or the applicable Special Servicer to enable the applicable Master Servicer or the applicable Special Servicer, as the case may be, to make any draw under any Letter of Credit shall constitute a Servicing Advance, and the applicable Master Servicer or the applicable Special Servicer, as the case may be, shall make reasonable efforts to recover such expenses from the related Borrower to the extent the Borrower







 is required to pay such expenses under the terms of the related Mortgage Loan or Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan.



 (e) To the extent an operations and maintenance plan is required to be established and executed pursuant to the terms of the Mortgage Loan Documents for a Serviced Mortgage Loan or Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan, the applicable Master Servicer shall request from the related Borrower written confirmation thereof within a reasonable time after the later of the Closing Date and the date as of which such plan is required to be established or completed.  To the extent any other action or remediation with respect to environmental matters is required to have been taken or completed pursuant to the terms of a Serviced Mortgage Loan or Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan, the applicable Master Servicer shall request from the related Borrower written confirmation of such action and remediation within a reasonable time after the later of the Closing Date and the date as of which such action or remediation are required to have been taken or completed.  To the extent that a Borrower shall fail to promptly respond to any inquiry described in this Section 3.03(e), the applicable Master Servicer shall notify the Trustee, the applicable Special Servicer, the Subordinate Class Representative, the Majority Subordinate Certificateholder and (if affected) the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder(s).  The applicable Master Servicer shall promptly notify the Trustee, the applicable Special Servicer, the Subordinate Class Representative and any affected Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder(s) if the applicable Master Servicer determines that the Borrower under any Serviced Mortgage Loan or Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan has failed to perform its obligations under such Serviced Mortgage Loan or Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan in respect of environmental matters.



 (f) Subject to applicable law and the terms of the related Mortgage Loan Documents, funds in the Servicing Accounts and the Reserve Accounts may be invested only in Permitted Investments in accordance with the provisions of Section 3.06.



 (g) With respect to each Serviced Mortgage Loan or Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan that requires the related Borrower to establish and maintain one or more lock-box, cash management or similar accounts, the applicable Master Servicer shall establish and maintain, in accordance with the Servicing Standard, such account(s) in accordance with the terms of the related Mortgage Loan Documents.  No such lock-box account is required to be an Eligible Account, unless the Mortgage Loan Documents otherwise so require.  The applicable Master Servicer shall apply the funds deposited in such accounts in accordance with terms of the related Mortgage Loan Documents, any lock-box, cash management or similar agreement and the Servicing Standard.

 (viii) insofar as they do not constitute Escrow Payments or Reserve Funds, any amounts relating to such Mortgage Loans paid by a Borrower specifically to cover items for which a Servicing Advance has been made or that represent a recovery of property protection expenses from a Borrower;







 (ix) any Loss of Value Payments, as set forth in Section 3.05(h) of this Agreement; and



 (x) the Interest Deposit Amount received from the Depositor on the Closing Date.



 Furthermore, the applicable Master Servicer shall deposit in the Collection Account any amounts required to be deposited by the applicable Master Servicer pursuant to Section 3.06, as and when required by such section, in connection with losses incurred with respect to Permitted Investments of funds held in the Collection Account.

The applicable Master Servicer shall promptly, and in any event within two (2) Business Days, deliver to the applicable Special Servicer any of the foregoing items received by it with respect to any Mortgage Loan, if and to the extent that such items constitute Additional Special Servicing Compensation payable to the applicable Special Servicer.  If a Master Servicer shall deposit in the Collection Account any amount not required to be deposited therein, it may at any time withdraw such amount from the Collection Account, any provision herein to the contrary notwithstanding.



 Upon receipt of any of the amounts described in clauses (i) through (iv) and (vii) through (viii) of the first paragraph of this Section 3.04(a) with respect to any Serviced Mortgage Loan, the applicable Special Servicer shall promptly, but in no event later than one Business Day after receipt, remit such amounts to the applicable Master Servicer for deposit into the Collection Account, unless the applicable Special Servicer determines, consistent with the Servicing Standard, that a particular item should not be deposited because of a restrictive endorsement.  With respect to any such amounts paid by check to the order of the applicable Special Servicer, the applicable Special Servicer shall endorse such check to the order of the applicable Master Servicer (in its capacity as such), without recourse, representation or warranty, unless the applicable Special Servicer determines, consistent with the Servicing Standard, that a particular item cannot be so endorsed and delivered because of a restrictive endorsement.  Any such amounts received by the applicable Special Servicer with respect to an Administered REO Property shall be deposited by such Special Servicer into the related REO Account and remitted to the applicable Master Servicer for deposit into the Collection Account pursuant to Section 3.16(c).







 (b) The Certificate Administrator shall establish and maintain one or more segregated accounts (collectively, the "Distribution Account"), to be held on behalf and in the name of the Trustee in trust for the benefit of the Certificateholders.  Each account that constitutes the Distribution Account shall be an Eligible Account.  The Certificate Administrator shall, as a bookkeeping matter, establish and maintain sub-accounts of the Distribution Account:  (i) the "REMIC I Sub-Account", the "REMIC II Sub-Account" and the "REMIC III Sub-Account" each of which sub-accounts shall be deemed to be held for the benefit of the Holders of the Certificates (other than the Class V Certificates), (ii)  the "Class V Sub-Account", which shall be deemed to be held for the benefit of the Holders of the Class V Certificates, and (iii) the "Exchangeable Sub-Account" which shall be deemed to be held for the benefit of the Holders of the Exchangeable Certificates.  Not later than 1:00 pxxPDmxxPD (New York City time) on each Master Servicer Remittance Date, each Master Servicer shall deliver to the Certificate Administrator, for deposit in the Distribution Account, an aggregate amount of immediately available funds equal to the related Master Servicer Remittance Amount for such Master Servicer Remittance Date.  In addition, each Master Servicer shall, as and when required hereunder, deliver to the Certificate Administrator for deposit in the Distribution Account any P&I Advances and Compensating Interest Payments required to be made by such Master Servicer hereunder.  Furthermore, any amounts paid by any party hereto to indemnify the Trust Fund pursuant to any provision hereof shall be delivered to the Certificate Administrator for deposit in the Distribution Account.  The Certificate Administrator shall, upon receipt, deposit in the Distribution Account any and all amounts received or, pursuant to Section 4.03, advanced by the Trustee that are required by the terms of this Agreement to be deposited therein.  As and when required pursuant to Section 3.05(c), the Certificate Administrator shall transfer Interest Reserve Amounts in respect of the Interest Reserve Loans from the Interest Reserve Account to the Distribution Account.  Furthermore, as and when required pursuant to Section 3.05(d), the Certificate Administrator shall transfer monies from the Excess Liquidation Proceeds Account to the Distribution Account.  The Certificate Administrator shall also deposit in the Distribution Account any amounts required to be deposited by the Certificate Administrator pursuant to Section 3.06 in connection with losses incurred with respect to Permitted Investments of funds held in the Distribution Account.  If the Certificate Administrator shall deposit in the Distribution Account any amount not required to be deposited therein, it may at any time withdraw such amount from the Distribution Account, any provision herein to the contrary notwithstanding.  Immediately upon the deposit of any amount into the Distribution Account, any portion thereof that represents any Post-ARD Additional Interest related to the ARD Mortgage Loans and/or any successor REO Mortgage Loans with respect thereto included in the Mortgage Pool shall be deemed to have been deposited into the Class V Sub-Account, and the remaining portion thereof shall be deemed to have been deposited into the REMIC I Sub-Account.  In addition, all amounts deposited into the Distribution Account shall be deemed to have been deposited into the REMIC I Sub-Account, except that (a) any portion of a Master Servicer Remittance Amount that represents any Post-ARD Additional Interest related to the ARD Mortgage Loans and/or any successor REO Mortgage Loans with respect thereto shall be deemed to have been deposited into the Class V Sub-Account and (b) any amounts deposited into the Distribution Account by the Certificate Administrator pursuant to Section 3.06 in connection with losses incurred with respect to Permitted Investments of funds held in the Distribution Account shall be deemed to have been deposited into the Class V Sub-Account







 insofar as the losses were incurred in respect of investments of amounts on deposit in the Class V Sub-Account.



 (c) The Certificate Administrator shall establish and maintain one or more accounts (collectively, the "Interest Reserve Account") to be held on behalf and in the name of the Trustee for the benefit of the Certificateholders.  Each account that constitutes the Interest Reserve Account shall be an Eligible Account or a sub-account of the Distribution Account.  On the Distribution Date in January (except during a leap year) and February of each calendar year, commencing in 2015, prior to any distributions being made with respect to the Certificates on such Distribution Date, the Certificate Administrator shall, with respect to each Interest Reserve Loan, withdraw from the Distribution Account and deposit in the Interest Reserve Account an amount equal to the Interest Reserve Amount, if any, in respect of such Interest Reserve Loan for such Distribution Date; provided that no such transfer of monies from the Distribution Account to the Interest Reserve Account shall be made on the Final Distribution Date.  The Certificate Administrator shall also deposit in the Interest Reserve Account from its own funds any amounts required to be deposited by the Certificate Administrator pursuant to Section 3.06 in connection with losses incurred with respect to Permitted Investments of funds held in the Interest Reserve Account.



 Notwithstanding that the Interest Reserve Account may be a sub-account of the Distribution Account for reasons of administrative convenience, the Interest Reserve Account and the Distribution Account shall, for all purposes of this Agreement (including the obligations and responsibilities of the Certificate Administrator hereunder), be considered to be and shall be required to be treated as, separate and distinct accounts.



 (d) If any Excess Liquidation Proceeds are received, the Certificate Administrator shall establish and maintain one or more accounts (collectively, the "Excess Liquidation Proceeds Account") to be held on behalf and in the name of the Trustee for the benefit of the Certificateholders.  Each account that constitutes the Excess Liquidation Proceeds Account shall be an Eligible Account (or a separately identified sub-account of the Distribution Account, provided that for all purposes of this Agreement (including the obligations of the Certificate Administrator hereunder) such account shall be considered to be and shall be required to be treated as separate and distinct from the Distribution Account).  On the Master Servicer Remittance Date, the applicable Master Servicer shall withdraw from its Collection Account and remit to the Certificate Administrator for deposit in the Excess Liquidation Proceeds Account all Excess Liquidation Proceeds received by it during the Collection Period ending on the Determination Date immediately prior to the Master Servicer Remittance Date.

 (e) For the avoidance of doubt, each of the Collection Account, the Interest Reserve Account, the Excess Liquidation Proceeds Account, the REO Account, any Reserve Account, any Servicing Account, and the REMIC I Sub-Account (including interest, if any, earned on the investment of funds in such accounts) will be owned by REMIC I; the REMIC II Sub-Account (including interest, if any, earned on the investment of funds in such account) will







 be owned by REMIC II; the REMIC III Sub-Account (including interest, if any, earned on the investment of funds in such account) will be owned by REMIC III; the Class V Sub-Account and the Exchangeable Sub-Account (including interest, if any, earned on the investment of funds in such accounts) will be owned by the Grantor Trust Pool for the benefit of the Holders of the Class V Certificates and the Exchangeable Certificates, respectively; the Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Custodial Account (including interest, if any, earned on the investment of funds in such account) will be owned by the applicable Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder(s) as described in Section 3.04(h); and the Loss of Value Reserve Fund (including interest, if any, earned on the investment of funds in such account) will be owned by the applicable Mortgage Loan Sellers as described in Section 3.04(f) for federal income tax purposes.



 (f) Funds in the Collection Account, the Distribution Account, the Interest Reserve Account, the Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Custodian Account and the Excess Liquidation Proceeds Account may be invested in Permitted Investments in accordance with the provisions of Section 3.06.  The applicable Master Servicer shall give notice to the other parties hereto of the location of the Collection Account as of the Closing Date and of the new location of its Collection Account prior to any change thereof.



 (g) If any Loss of Value Payments are received in connection with a Material Document Defect or Material Breach, as the case may be, pursuant to or as contemplated by Section 2.03(h) of this Agreement, the applicable Special Servicer shall establish and maintain one or more accounts (collectively, the "Loss of Value Reserve Fund") to be held in trust for the benefit of the Certificateholders, for purposes of holding such Loss of Value Payments.  Each account that constitutes the Loss of Value Reserve Fund shall be an Eligible Account or a sub-account of an Eligible Account.  The applicable Special Servicer shall, upon receipt, deposit in the Loss of Value Reserve Fund all Loss of Value Payments received by it.  The Loss of Value Reserve Fund shall be accounted for as an outside reserve fund within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.860G-2(h) and not an asset of any REMIC Pool.  Furthermore, for all federal tax purposes, the Certificate Administrator shall (i) treat amounts paid out of the Loss of Value Reserve Fund through the Collection Account to the Certificateholders as damages paid to and distributed by the REMIC Pools on account of a breach of a representation or warranty by the related Mortgage Loan Seller and (ii) treat any amounts paid out of the Loss of Value Reserve Fund through the Collection Account to a Mortgage Loan Seller as distributions by the Trust Fund to such Mortgage Loan Seller as beneficial owner of the Loss of Value Reserve Fund.  The applicable Mortgage Loan Seller will be the beneficial owner of the related account in the Loss of Value Reserve Fund for all federal income tax purposes, and shall be taxable on all income earned thereon.



 (h) Any applicable Master Servicer that is servicing a Serviced Loan Combination shall segregate and hold all funds collected and received by it in connection with the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan separate and apart from its own funds and general assets.  In connection therewith, if there is one or more Serviced Loan Combinations related to this Trust, the related Master Servicer shall establish and maintain one or more segregated accounts (each, a "Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Custodial Account"), in which the funds described below are to be deposited and held on behalf of the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder(s) (and which accounts may be maintained as separately







 identified sub-accounts of the Collection Account, provided that for all purposes of this Agreement (including the obligations of the applicable Master Servicer hereunder) such accounts shall be considered to be and shall be required to be treated as separate and distinct from the Collection Account).  The Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Custodial Account shall be an Eligible Account or a sub-account of an Eligible Account.  The applicable Master Servicer shall deposit or cause to be deposited in the Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Custodial Account, within one Business Day of receipt by it of properly identified funds or as otherwise required hereunder, the following payments and collections received or made by or on behalf of the applicable Master Servicer in respect of the Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan subsequent to the Closing Date:



 (i) all payments (from whatever source) on account of principal of the Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan, including Principal Prepayments;



 (ii) all payments (from whatever source) on account of interest on the Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan, including Default Interest;



 (iii) all Prepayment Premiums and Yield Maintenance Charges received in respect of the Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan;



 (iv) all Insurance Proceeds, Condemnation Proceeds and Liquidation Proceeds received in respect of, and allocable as interest (including Default Interest) on, principal of or Prepayment Premiums or Yield Maintenance Charges with respect to, the Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan (or any successor REO Mortgage Loan with respect thereto);



 (v) any amounts required to be deposited by the applicable Master Servicer pursuant to Section 3.06 in connection with losses incurred with respect to Permitted Investments of funds held in the Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Custodial Account;



 (vi) any amounts required to be deposited by the applicable Master Servicer or the applicable Special Servicer pursuant to Section 3.07(c) in connection with losses on the Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan (or any successor interest in a REO Mortgage Loan with respect thereto) resulting from a deductible clause in a blanket or master force-placed hazard insurance policy;



 (vii) any amounts required to be transferred to the Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Custodial Account from the related REO Account pursuant to Section 3.16(c); and



 (viii) any other amounts received and applied on the Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan pursuant to the related Intercreditor Agreement.



 Notwithstanding the foregoing requirements, the applicable Master Servicer need not deposit into the Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Custodial Account any amount that the applicable Master Servicer would be authorized to withdraw immediately from the Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Custodial Account in accordance with the terms of Section 3.05 and shall be entitled to instead pay such amount directly to the Person(s) entitled thereto.







 The foregoing requirements for deposit in the Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Custodial Account shall be exclusive.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, actual payments from the applicable Borrower in the nature of Escrow Payments, Reserve Funds, Assumption Fees, Assumption Application Fees, earn-out fees, extension fees, Modification Fees, charges for beneficiary statements or demands, amounts collected for checks returned for insufficient funds and other fees and amounts collected from the applicable Borrower that constitute Additional Master Servicing Compensation and/or Additional Special Servicing Compensation, need not be deposited by the applicable Master Servicer in the Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Custodial Account.  The applicable Master Servicer shall promptly deliver to the applicable Special Servicer any of the foregoing items received by it with respect to the Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan, if and to the extent that such items constitute Additional Special Servicing Compensation with respect to the Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan.  If a Master Servicer shall deposit in the Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Custodial Account any amount not required to be deposited therein, it may at any time withdraw such amount from the Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Custodial Account, any provision herein to the contrary notwithstanding.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent the applicable Master Servicer, the applicable Special Servicer or the Trustee, as applicable, obtains funds from the Collection Account that are unrelated to a Serviced Loan Combination as a reimbursement for a Nonrecoverable Servicing Advance or any Advance Interest on a Servicing Advance or a Nonrecoverable Servicing Advance relating to a Serviced Loan Combination, the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder is required under the related Intercreditor Agreement to, promptly following notice from the applicable Master Servicer, reimburse the Trust Fund for its pro rata share of such Nonrecoverable Servicing Advance or Advance Interest to the extent set forth in the related Intercreditor Agreement.







 If amounts on deposit in the Collection Account at any particular time (after withdrawing any portion of such amounts deposited in the Collection Account in error) are insufficient to satisfy all payments, reimbursements and remittances to be made therefrom as set forth in clauses (ii) through (xxi) of the preceding paragraph, then the corresponding withdrawals from the Collection Account shall be made in the following priority and subject to the following rules:  (x) if the payment, reimbursement or remittance is to be made from a specific source of funds, then such payment, reimbursement or remittance shall be made from that specific source of funds on a pro rata basis with any and all other payments, reimbursements and remittances to be made from such specific source of funds; and (y) if the payment, reimbursement or remittance can be made from any funds on deposit in the Collection Account, then (following any withdrawals made from the Collection Account in accordance with the immediately preceding clause (x) of this sentence) such payment, reimbursement or remittance shall be made from the general funds remaining on deposit in the Collection Account on a pro rata basis with any and all other payments, reimbursements or remittances to be made from such general funds; provided, that any reimbursements of Advances in respect of any particular Mortgage Loan or REO Property out of the Collection Account pursuant to any of clauses (ii), (v) and (vi) of the first paragraph of this Section 3.05(a)(I), and any payments of interest thereon out of the Collection Account pursuant to either of clauses (vii) and (viii) of the first paragraph of this Section 3.05(a)(I), shall be made (to the extent of their respective entitlements to such reimbursements and/or payments):  first, to the Trustee; and second, pro rata, to the applicable Master Servicer and the applicable Special Servicer.



 The applicable Master Servicer shall keep and maintain separate accounting records, on a loan-by-loan and property-by-property basis when appropriate, in connection with any withdrawal from its Collection Account pursuant to any of clauses (ii) through (xviii) of the first paragraph of this Section 3.05(a)(I).



 The applicable Master Servicer shall pay to the other Master Servicer, the applicable Special Servicer, and, subject to Section 3.01(h)(i), the Non-Trust Master Servicer, the Non-Trust Special Servicer, the Non-Trust Certificate Administrator or the Non-Trust Trustee, as applicable, from its Collection Account on each Master Servicer Remittance Date amounts permitted to be paid to the other Master Servicer, the applicable Special Servicer, the Non-Trust Master Servicer, the Non-Trust Special Servicer, the Non-Trust Certificate Administrator or the Non-Trust Trustee, as applicable, therefrom based upon an Officer's Certificate received from the other Master Servicer, applicable Special Servicer, the Non-Trust Master Servicer, the Non-Trust Special Servicer, the Non-Trust Certificate Administrator or the Non-Trust Trustee, as applicable, on the first Business Day following the immediately preceding Determination Date, describing the item and amount to which the other Master Servicer, the applicable Special Servicer, the Non-Trust Master Servicer, the Non-Trust Special Servicer, the Non-Trust Certificate Administrator or the Non-Trust Trustee, as applicable, is entitled.  The applicable Master Servicer may rely conclusively on any such certificate and shall have no duty to re-calculate the amounts stated therein.  Each Special Servicer shall keep and maintain separate accounting for the Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans and REO Properties to as to which it is the applicable Special Servicer on a loan-by-loan and property-by-property basis, for the purpose of justifying any request thereby for withdrawal from the Collection Account.







  Subsection (II).  The provisions of this subsection (II) of this Section 3.05(a) shall apply notwithstanding any contrary provision of subsection (I) of this Section 3.05(a):



 (i) Identification of Workout-Delayed Reimbursement Amounts:  If any Advance made with respect to any Mortgage Loan on or before the date on which such Mortgage Loan becomes (or, but for the making of three monthly payments under its modified terms, would then constitute) a Corrected Mortgage Loan, together with (to the extent theretofore accrued and unpaid) Advance Interest thereon, is not pursuant to the operation of the provisions of Section 3.05(a)(I) reimbursed to the Person who made such Advance on or before the date, if any, on which such Mortgage Loan becomes a Corrected Mortgage Loan (or, but for the making of three monthly payments under its modified terms, would constitute a Mortgage Loan that is a Corrected Mortgage Loan), such Advance, together with such Advance Interest, shall constitute a "Workout-Delayed Reimbursement Amount" to the extent that such amount has not been determined to constitute a Nonrecoverable Advance.  All references herein to "Workout-Delayed Reimbursement Amount" shall be construed always to mean the related Advance and (to the extent theretofore accrued and unpaid) any Advance Interest thereon, together with (to the extent it remains unpaid) any further Advance Interest that accrues on the unreimbursed portion of such Advance from time to time in accordance with the other provisions of this Agreement.  That any amount constitutes all or a portion of any Workout-Delayed Reimbursement Amount shall not in any manner limit the right of any Person hereunder to determine that such amount instead constitutes a Nonrecoverable Advance.



 (ii) General Relationship of Provisions.  Subsection (iii) below (subject to the terms, conditions and limitations thereof) sets forth the terms of and conditions to the right of a Person to be reimbursed for any Workout-Delayed Reimbursement Amount to the extent that such Person is not otherwise entitled to reimbursement and payment of such Workout-Delayed Reimbursement Amount pursuant to the operation of Section 3.05(a)(I) above (construed without regard to the reference therein to this subsection except that it is nonetheless hereby acknowledged that, for purposes of "Late Collections" in subsection 3.05(a)(I), funds received on the related Mortgage Loan shall be applied in accordance with the terms of the applicable modification even though such application may result in an Advance continuing to be outstanding when the Borrower is current in its payments under the terms of the Mortgage Loan as modified).  Subsection (iv) below (subject to the terms, conditions and limitations thereof) authorizes or permits the applicable Master Servicer, under certain circumstances, to abstain from reimbursing itself (or, if applicable, the Trustee to abstain from obtaining reimbursement) for Nonrecoverable Advances at its sole option.  Upon any determination that all or any portion of a Workout-Delayed Reimbursement Amount constitutes a Nonrecoverable Advance, then the reimbursement or payment of such amount (and any further Advance Interest that may accrue thereon) shall cease to be subject to the operation of subsection (iii) below, such amount (and further Advance Interest) shall be as fully payable and reimbursable







 to the relevant Person as would any other Nonrecoverable Advance (and Advance Interest thereon) and, as a Nonrecoverable Advance, such amount may become the subject of the applicable Master Servicer's (or, if applicable, the Trustee's) exercise of its sole option authorized by subsection (iv) below.



 (iii) Reimbursements of Workout-Delayed Reimbursement Amounts:  The applicable Master Servicer, the applicable Special Servicer and the Trustee, as applicable, shall be entitled to reimbursement and payment (and, notwithstanding any contrary provision of subsection (I) above, shall be entitled to withdraw and pay to itself the amount of such reimbursement and payment) for all Workout-Delayed Reimbursement Amounts in each Collection Period (and it is again hereby acknowledged that, for purposes of "Late Collections" in subsection 3.05(a)(I), funds received on the related Mortgage Loan shall be applied in accordance with the terms of the applicable modification even though such application may result in an Advance continuing to be outstanding when the Borrower is current in its payments under the terms of the Mortgage Loan as modified); provided, that the aggregate amount (for all such Persons collectively) of such reimbursements and payments from amounts advanced or collected on the Mortgage Pool in such Collection Period shall not exceed (and the reimbursement and payment shall be made from) the aggregate principal portions of P&I Advances and principal collections and recoveries on the Mortgage Pool for such Collection Period contemplated by clauses (i) through (v) of the definition of "Unadjusted Principal Distribution Amount," net of the aggregate deduction amounts for Nonrecoverable Advances (and accrued and unpaid Advance Interest thereon) that were reimbursed or paid during the related Collection Period from principal collections on the Mortgage Pool, as described by clause (II)(B) of the definition of "Principal Distribution Amount" and pursuant to subsection (iv) of this Section 3.05(a)(II).  As and to the extent provided in clause (II)(A) of the definition thereof, the Principal Distribution Amount for the Distribution Date related to such Collection Period shall be reduced to the extent that such payment or reimbursement of a Workout-Delayed Reimbursement Amount is made from aggregate principal collections pursuant to the preceding sentence.



 Any collections (as applied under Section 1.03) received on or in respect of the Mortgage Loans during a Collection Period that, in each case, represents a delinquent amount as to which an Advance had been made, which Advance was previously reimbursed during the Collection Period for a prior Distribution Date as part of a Workout-Delayed Reimbursement Amount, shall be added to and constitute a part of the Principal Distribution Amount for the related Distribution Date (pursuant to clause (I)(B) of the definition of "Principal Distribution Amount") to the extent of all Workout-Delayed Reimbursement Amounts on or in respect of such respective Mortgage Loan that were reimbursed from collections of principal on the Mortgage Pool in all prior Collection Periods pursuant to the preceding paragraph.



 The Certificate Administrator (and, with respect to Advances made by the applicable Master Servicer or the Trustee) shall be entitled to rely conclusively upon any direction or notice received from the applicable Master Servicer in connection with any determination made by the applicable Master Servicer pursuant to the foregoing provisions of







 this Section 3.05(a)(II)(iii) and shall not be obligated to independently verify, monitor or oversee any such determination.



 (iv) Sole Option to Abstain from Reimbursements of Certain Nonrecoverable Advances.  To the extent that Section 3.05(a)(I) entitles the applicable Master Servicer, the applicable Special Servicer or the Trustee to reimbursement for any Nonrecoverable Advance (or payment of Advance Interest thereon from a source other than Default Charges on the related Mortgage Loan) during any Collection Period, then, notwithstanding any contrary provision of subsection (I) above, (a) to the extent that one or more such reimbursements and payments of Nonrecoverable Advances (and such Advance Interest thereon) are made, they shall be made, first, from the aggregate principal portions of P&I Advances and principal collections and recoveries on the Mortgage Pool for such Collection Period contemplated by clauses (i) through (v) of the definition of "Unadjusted Principal Distribution Amount," and then from other amounts advanced or collected on the Mortgage Pool for such Collection Period; provided that, if so provided as set forth below, the applicable Master Servicer, the applicable Special Servicer or the Trustee, as applicable, shall provide each Rating Agency with at least fifteen (15) days' notice before any reimbursement shall be made of a Nonrecoverable Advance (or payment of Advance Interest thereon from a source other than Default Charges on the related Mortgage Loan from such other amounts advanced or collected on the Mortgage Pool for such Collection Period, and (b) if and to the extent that the amount of such a Nonrecoverable Advance (and Advance Interest thereon), together with all Nonrecoverable Advances (and Advance Interest thereon) theretofore reimbursed during such Collection Period, would exceed the aggregate principal portions of P&I Advances and principal collections and recoveries on the Mortgage Pool for such Collection Period contemplated by clauses (i) through (v) of the definition of "Unadjusted Principal Distribution Amount," the applicable Master Servicer and/or the Trustee, as applicable, if it made the relevant Advance) is hereby authorized (but shall not be construed to have any obligation whatsoever), if it elects at its sole option and in its sole discretion, to abstain from reimbursing itself or obtaining reimbursement (notwithstanding that it is entitled to such reimbursement) during that Collection Period for all or a portion of such Nonrecoverable Advance (and Advance Interest thereon), for successive one-month periods for a total period not to exceed twelve (12) months; provided that any such deferral exceeding six (6) months shall require (during a Subordinate Control Period) the consent of the Subordinate Class Representative and (during a Collective Consultation Period) consultation with the Subordinate Class Representative; provided, further, that the aggregate amount that is the subject of the exercise of such option with respect to all Nonrecoverable Advances (and Advance Interest thereon) with respect to all Mortgage Loans for any particular Collection Period is less than or equal to such excess described above in this clause (b).  If the applicable Master Servicer (or the Trustee, as applicable) makes such an election at its sole option to defer reimbursement with respect to all or a portion of a Nonrecoverable Advance (and Advance Interest thereon), then such Nonrecoverable Advance (and Advance Interest thereon) or portion thereof shall







 continue to be fully reimbursable in any subsequent Collection Period.  In connection with a potential election by the applicable Master Servicer (or the Trustee, as applicable) to abstain from the reimbursement of a particular Nonrecoverable Advance or portion thereof during the Collection Period for any Distribution Date, the applicable Master Servicer (or the Trustee, as applicable) shall further be authorized to wait for principal collections to be received before making its determination of whether to abstain from the reimbursement of a particular Nonrecoverable Advance or portion thereof.  The applicable Master Servicer or the Trustee, as applicable, shall give the Rating Agencies at least fifteen (15) days' notice (subject to Section 3.27) prior to any reimbursement to it of Nonrecoverable Advances from amounts in the Collection Account or Distribution Account, as applicable, allocable to interest on the Mortgage Loans unless (1) the applicable Master Servicer or the Trustee, as applicable, determines in its sole discretion that waiting fifteen (15) days after such a notice could jeopardize its ability to recover such Nonrecoverable Advances, (2) changed circumstances or new or different information becomes known to the applicable Master Servicer or Trustee, as applicable, that could affect or cause a determination of whether any Advance is a Nonrecoverable Advance or whether to defer reimbursement of a Nonrecoverable Advance or the determination in clause (1) above, or (3) the applicable Master Servicer has not timely received from the Trustee information requested by the applicable Master Servicer to consider in determining whether to defer reimbursement of a Nonrecoverable Advance; provided, that, if any of clause (1), clause (2) or clause (3) above apply, the applicable Master Servicer or Trustee, as applicable, shall give each Rating Agency notice (subject to Section 3.27) of an anticipated reimbursement to it of Nonrecoverable Advances from amounts in the Collection Account or Distribution Account, as applicable, allocable to interest on the Mortgage Loans as soon as reasonably practicable in such circumstances.  The applicable Master Servicer or the Trustee, as applicable, shall have no liability for any loss, liability or expenses resulting from any notice provided to the Rating Agencies contemplated by the immediately preceding sentence.



 Any collections (as applied under Section 1.03) received on the Mortgage Loans during a Collection Period that, in each case, represents a recovery of an amount determined in a prior Collection Period to have been a Nonrecoverable Advance shall be added to and constitute a part of the Principal Distribution Amount for the related Distribution Date (pursuant to clause (I)(C) of the definition of "Principal Distribution Amount") to the extent of all Nonrecoverable Advances on such respective Mortgage Loan that were reimbursed from collections of principal on the Mortgage Pool in all prior Collection Periods pursuant to the preceding paragraph.



 None of the Master Servicers or the Trustee shall have any liability whatsoever for making an election, or refraining from making an election, that is authorized under this subsection (II)(iv).  The foregoing shall not, however, be construed to limit any liability that may otherwise be imposed on such Person for any failure by such Person to comply with the conditions to making such an election under this subsection (II)(iv) or to comply with the terms







 of this subsection (II)(iv) and the other provisions of this Agreement that apply once such an election, if any, has been made.



 Any election by the applicable Master Servicer (or the Trustee, as applicable) to abstain from reimbursing itself for any Nonrecoverable Advance (and Advance Interest thereon) or portion thereof with respect to any Collection Period shall not be construed to impose on the applicable Master Servicer (or the Trustee, as applicable) any obligation to make such an election (or any entitlement in favor of any Certificateholder or any other Person to such an election) with respect to any subsequent Collection Period or to constitute a waiver or limitation on the right of the applicable Master Servicer (or the Trustee, as applicable) to otherwise be reimbursed for such Nonrecoverable Advance (and Advance Interest thereon).  Any such election by one of the applicable Master Servicer or the Trustee shall not be construed to impose any duty on any other such party to make such an election (or any entitlement in favor of any Certificateholder or any other Person to such an election).  Any such election by any such party to abstain from reimbursing itself or obtaining reimbursement for any Nonrecoverable Advance or portion thereof with respect to any one or more Collection Periods shall not limit the accrual of Advance Interest on such Nonrecoverable Advance for the period prior to the actual reimbursement of such Nonrecoverable Advance.  None of the Master Servicers, the Trustee or the other parties to this Agreement shall have any liability to one another or to any of the Certificateholders or any of the Companion Loan Holders for any such election that such party makes to defer or not to defer reimbursement as contemplated by this subsection or for any losses, damages or other adverse economic or other effects that may arise from such an election, nor shall such election constitute a violation of the Servicing Standard or any duty under this Agreement.  The foregoing statements in this paragraph shall not limit the generality of the statements made in the immediately preceding paragraph.



 The Certificate Administrator (and, with respect to Advances made by the applicable Master Servicer and the Trustee) shall be entitled to rely conclusively upon any direction or notice received from the applicable Master Servicer in connection with any determination made by the applicable Master Servicer pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 3.05(a)(II)(iv) and shall not be obligated to independently verify, monitor or oversee any such determination.



 (v) Deferral is Not Subordination.  No determination by the applicable Master Servicer (or the Trustee, as applicable) to exercise its sole option to defer the reimbursement of Advances and/or Advance Interest under subsection (iv) shall be construed as an agreement by the applicable Master Servicer (or the Trustee, as applicable) to subordinate (in respect of realizing losses), to any Class of Certificates, such party's right to such reimbursement during such period of deferral.



 (b) The Certificate Administrator shall, from time to time, make withdrawals from the Distribution Account for each of the following purposes (the order set forth below not constituting an order of priority for such withdrawals):

 (v) to pay for the cost of the Opinions of Counsel as contemplated by Section 12.01(a) or Section 12.01(c) in connection with any amendment to this Agreement requested by the Trustee or the Certificate Administrator which amendment is in furtherance of the rights and interests of Certificateholders;

 The Trustee, the Certificate Administrator, the Depositor, the applicable Master Servicer, the applicable Special Servicer and the Trust Advisor, as applicable, shall in all cases have a right prior to the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder(s) to any particular funds on deposit in a Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Custodial Account from time to time for the reimbursement or payment of compensation, Servicing Advances (with interest thereon at the Reimbursement Rate) and their respective expenses hereunder, but only if and to the extent such compensation, Servicing Advances (with interest) and expenses are to be reimbursed or paid from such funds on deposit in such Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Custodial Account pursuant to the express terms of this Agreement and/or the related Intercreditor Agreement.

 (iii) to offset any portion of Realized Losses that are attributable to such Mortgage Loan or related REO Property (as calculated without regard to the application of such Loss of Value Payments), incurred with respect to such Mortgage Loan or any related successor REO Mortgage Loan;



 (iv) following the occurrence of a Liquidation Event with respect to such Mortgage Loan or any related REO Property and any related transfers from the Loss of Value Reserve Fund with respect to the items contemplated by the immediately preceding clauses (i)-(iii) as to such Mortgage Loan, to cover the items contemplated by the immediately preceding clauses (i)-(iii) in respect of any other Mortgage Loan or REO Mortgage Loan; and

 Any Loss of Value Payments transferred to the Collection Account pursuant to clauses (i)-(iii) of the prior paragraph shall be treated as Liquidation Proceeds Received by the Trust in respect of the related Mortgage Loan or any successor REO Mortgage Loan with respect thereto for which such Loss of Value Payments were received; and any Loss of Value Payments transferred to the Collection Account pursuant to clause (iv) of the prior paragraph shall be treated as Liquidation Proceeds Received by the Trust in respect of the Mortgage Loan or REO Mortgage Loan for which such Loss of Value Payments are being transferred to the Collection Account to cover an item contemplated by clauses (i)-(iii) of the prior paragraph.



 (h) With respect to any Serviced Loan Combination, if amounts required to pay the compensation, fees, costs, expenses or reimbursement incurred in connection with the servicing and administration of the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan exceed amounts on deposit in the Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Custodial Account and the applicable Master Servicer, the applicable Special Servicer, the Certificate Administrator, the Trust Advisor or the Trustee, as applicable, have sought reimbursement from the Trust Fund with respect to such expenses allocable to such Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan, then the applicable Master Servicer or the applicable Special Servicer, as applicable, shall use efforts in accordance with the Servicing Standard to exercise promptly the rights of the Trust Fund under the related Intercreditor Agreement to obtain reimbursement from the holder of the Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan for that holder's pro rata share of the expense.







 Section 3.06 Investment of Funds in the Accounts.

All such Permitted Investments shall be held to maturity, unless payable on demand.  Any investment of funds in an Investment Account shall be made in the name of the Trustee (in its capacity as such).  The applicable Master Servicer (with respect to Permitted Investments of amounts in its Collection Account, any Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Custodial Account, any Servicing Account or any Reserve Account, in each case, maintained by it), the applicable Special Servicer (with respect to Permitted Investments of amounts in the REO Account), and the Certificate Administrator (with respect to Permitted Investments of amounts in the Distribution Account, the Interest Reserve Account or the Excess Liquidation Proceeds Account) acting on behalf of the Trustee, shall (and the Trustee hereby designates the applicable Master Servicer, the applicable Special Servicer or the Certificate Administrator, as the case may be, as the Person that shall) (i) be the "entitlement holder" of any Permitted Investment that is a "security entitlement" and (ii) maintain "control" of any Permitted Investment that is either a "certificated security" or an "uncertificated security."  For purposes of this Section 3.06(a), the terms "entitlement holder," "security entitlement," "control," "certificated security" and "uncertificated security" shall have the meanings given such terms in Revised Article 8 (1994 Revision) of the UCC, and "control" of any Permitted Investment by the applicable Master Servicer, the applicable Special Servicer or the Certificate Administrator shall constitute "control" by a Person designated by, and acting on behalf of, the Trustee for purposes of Revised Article 8 (1994 Revision) of the UCC.  If amounts on deposit in an Investment Account are at any time invested in a Permitted Investment payable on demand, the party hereunder that maintains such Investment Account (whether it is the applicable Master Servicer, the applicable Special Servicer or the Certificate Administrator), shall:







 (x)           consistent with any notice required to be given thereunder, demand that payment thereon be made on the last day such Permitted Investment may otherwise mature hereunder in an amount at least equal to the lesser of (1) all amounts then payable thereunder and (2) the amount required to be withdrawn on such date; and



 (y)           demand payment of all amounts due thereunder promptly upon determination by the applicable Master Servicer, the applicable Special Servicer or the Certificate Administrator, as the case may be, that such Permitted Investment would not constitute a Permitted Investment in respect of funds thereafter on deposit in such Investment Account.



 (b) Whether or not the applicable Master Servicer directs the investment of funds in any Investment Account (other than a Servicing Account or Reserve Account) maintained by it, interest and investment income realized on funds deposited therein, to the extent of the Net Investment Earnings, if any, for such Investment Account for each Collection Period, shall be for the sole and exclusive benefit of the applicable Master Servicer and shall be subject to its withdrawal in accordance with Section 3.05.  Whether or not the applicable Master Servicer directs the investment of funds in any Servicing Account or Reserve Account maintained by it, interest and investment income realized on funds deposited therein, to the extent of the Net Investment Earnings, if any, for such Investment Account for each Collection Period, and subject to the requirements of applicable law or the terms of the related Serviced Mortgage Loan(s) or Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan(s) regarding the payment of such interest and investment income to the related Borrower, shall be for the sole and exclusive benefit of the applicable Master Servicer and shall be subject to withdrawal from time to time in accordance with Section 3.03.  Whether or not the applicable Special Servicer directs the investment of funds in the REO Account or the Loss of Value Reserve Fund, interest and investment income realized on funds deposited therein, to the extent of the Net Investment Earnings, if any, for such Investment Account for each Collection Period, shall be for the sole and exclusive benefit of the applicable Special Servicer and shall be subject to its withdrawal in accordance with Section 3.16(b).  Whether or not the Certificate Administrator directs the investment of funds in the Distribution Account, the Interest Reserve Account or the Excess Liquidation Proceeds Account, interest and investment income realized on funds deposited therein, to the extent of the Net Investment Earnings, if any, for each such Investment Account for each Collection Period, shall be for the sole and exclusive benefit of the Certificate Administrator and shall be subject to its withdrawal in accordance with Section 3.05.  If any loss shall be incurred in respect of any Permitted Investment on deposit in any Investment Account, the party hereunder that maintains such Investment Account (whether it is the applicable Master Servicer, the applicable Special Servicer or the Certificate Administrator), shall promptly deposit therein from its own funds, without right of reimbursement, no later than the end of the Collection Period during which such loss was incurred, the amount of the Net Investment Loss, if any, in respect of such Investment Account for such Collection Period (except, in the case of any such loss with respect to a Servicing Account or Reserve Account, to the extent the loss amounts were invested for the benefit of a Borrower under the terms of a Serviced Mortgage Loan, Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan or applicable law).



 (c) Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, if any default occurs in the making of any payment due (or in any other performance required) under any







 Permitted Investment of funds on deposit in any Investment Account, and if the party hereunder that maintains such Investment Account (whether it is the applicable Master Servicer, the applicable Special Servicer or the Certificate Administrator) is in default of its obligations under or contemplated by Section 3.06(b), the Trustee may and, subject to Section 8.02, upon the request of (i) Holders of Certificates entitled to not less than 25% of the Voting Rights allocated to any Class of Interest Only Certificates or Principal Balance Certificates or (ii) the Subordinate Class Representative or (iii) alternatively, but only if the Permitted Investment involves funds on deposit in the Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Custodial Account, the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder(s) (it being understood that, for purposes of this clause (iii), Section 8.02 shall be construed as if references therein to one or more "Certificateholders" were instead references to such Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder), the Trustee shall, take such action as may be appropriate to enforce such payment or performance, including the institution and prosecution of appropriate legal proceedings.  Any costs incurred by the Trustee in taking any such action shall be reimbursed to it by the party hereunder that maintains such Investment Account (whether it is the applicable Master Servicer, the applicable Special Servicer or the Certificate Administrator).  This provision is in no way intended to limit any actions that the applicable Master Servicer, the applicable Special Servicer or the Certificate Administrator may take in this regard at its own expense.



 (d) Notwithstanding the investment of funds held in any Investment Account, for purposes of the calculations hereunder, including the calculation of the Available Distribution Amount, the Master Servicer Remittance Amount and the monthly amounts payable to the respective Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder(s), the amounts so invested shall be deemed to remain on deposit in such Investment Account.

 (a) In the case of each Serviced Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination, the applicable Master Servicer shall use reasonable efforts consistent with the Servicing Standard to cause the related Borrower to maintain (including identifying the extent to which a Borrower is maintaining insurance coverage and, if such Borrower does not so maintain, the applicable Master Servicer will itself cause to be maintained with Qualified Insurers having the Required Claims-Paying Ratings) for the related Mortgaged Property (x) a fire and casualty extended coverage insurance policy, which does not provide for reduction due to depreciation, in an amount that is at least equal to the lesser of (i) the full replacement cost of improvements securing such Serviced Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination or (ii) the outstanding principal balance of such Serviced Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination, but, in any event, in an amount sufficient to avoid the application of any co-insurance clause and (y) all other insurance coverage (including but not limited to coverage for damage resulting from acts of terrorism) as is required or (subject to the Servicing Standard) that the lender is entitled to reasonably require, subject to applicable law, under the related Mortgage Loan Documents; provided that all of the following conditions and/or limitations shall apply:



 (A) the applicable Master Servicer shall not be required to maintain any earthquake or environmental insurance policy on any Mortgaged Property securing a Serviced Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination unless such







 insurance policy was in effect at the time of the origination of such Serviced Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination pursuant to the terms of the related Mortgage Loan Documents and is available at commercially reasonable rates and the Trustee has an insurable interest;



 (B) if and to the extent that any Serviced Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination grants the lender thereunder any discretion (by way of consent, approval or otherwise) as to the insurance provider from whom the related Borrower is to obtain the requisite insurance coverage, the applicable Master Servicer shall (to the extent consistent with the Servicing Standard) use efforts consistent with the Servicing Standard to cause the related Borrower to obtain the requisite insurance coverage from Qualified Insurers that, in each case, have the Required Claims-Paying Ratings at the time such insurance coverage is obtained;



 (C) the applicable Master Servicer shall have no obligation beyond using its reasonable efforts consistent with the Servicing Standard to cause the Borrower under any Serviced Mortgage Loan to maintain the insurance required to be maintained or that the lender is entitled to reasonably require, subject to applicable law, under the related Mortgage Loan Documents;



 (D) in no event shall the applicable Master Servicer be required to cause the Borrower under any Serviced Mortgage Loan to maintain, or itself obtain, insurance coverage that the applicable Master Servicer has determined is either (i) not available at any rate or (ii) not available at commercially reasonable rates and the related hazards are not at the time commonly insured against at the then-available rates for properties similar to the related Mortgaged Property and located in or around the region in which the related Mortgaged Property is located;



 (E) the reasonable efforts of the applicable Master Servicer to cause the Borrower under any Serviced Mortgage Loan to maintain insurance shall be conducted in a manner that takes into account the insurance that would then be available to the applicable Master Servicer on a force-placed basis; and



 (F) to the extent the applicable Master Servicer itself is required to maintain insurance that the Borrower under any Serviced Mortgage Loan does not maintain, the applicable Master Servicer shall not be required to maintain insurance other than what is available to the applicable Master Servicer on a force-placed basis (and this will not be construed to modify the other limits set forth in clause (D) above).



 Notwithstanding the limitation set forth in clause (D) above, if the related Borrower under any Serviced Mortgage Loan fails to maintain with respect to the related Mortgaged Property (i) specific casualty insurance coverage providing for "special" form coverage that does not specifically exclude, terrorist or similar acts, and/or (ii) specific insurance coverage with respect to damages or casualties caused by terrorist or similar acts, the applicable Master Servicer shall cause the related Borrower to maintain, or itself obtain, such insurance







 upon terms not materially less favorable than those in place as of the Closing Date, unless the applicable Special Servicer has determined in its reasonable judgment based on inquiry consistent with the Servicing Standard, and (during any Subordinate Control Period) with the consent of the Subordinate Class Representative or (during any Collective Consultation Period or Senior Consultation Period) after having consulted with the Trust Advisor and (during any Collective Consultation Period) the Subordinate Class Representative, that either (a) such insurance is not available at commercially reasonable rates and that such hazards are not at the time commonly insured against for properties similar to the related Mortgaged Property and located in or around the region in which such related Mortgaged Property is located, or (b) such insurance is not available at any rate (failure to maintain required insurance due to either of clause (a) or (b) is referred to herein as an "Acceptable Insurance Default").  The Subordinate Class Representative and/or Trust Advisor, as applicable, will have no more than thirty (30) days to respond to the applicable Special Servicer's request for such consent or consultation; provided, that upon the applicable Special Servicer's determination, consistent with the Servicing Standard, that exigent circumstances do not allow the applicable Special Servicer to consult with the Subordinate Class Representative and/or Trust Advisor, the applicable Special Servicer will not be required to do so.  If any such approval of the applicable Special Servicer has not been expressly denied within ninety (90) days of the applicable Special Servicer's receipt from the applicable Master Servicer of the applicable Master Servicer's determination and analysis and all information reasonably requested thereby and reasonably available to the applicable Master Servicer in order to make an informed decision, such approval shall be deemed to have been granted.  If the applicable Special Servicer is in the process of making a determination described above in this paragraph, then, during the period of such evaluation by the applicable Special Servicer (or, to the extent applicable, during the period that the applicable Special Servicer is obtaining the consent of the Subordinate Class Representative or consulting with the Trust Advisor and/or the Subordinate Class Representative, as applicable), the applicable Master Servicer shall not be liable for any loss related to its failure to require the related Borrower to maintain terrorism insurance and shall not be in default of its obligations hereunder as a result of such failure to maintain terrorism insurance.



 The applicable Master Servicer shall notify the applicable Special Servicer, the Trustee, the Subordinate Class Representative and the Majority Subordinate Certificateholder and (if a Serviced Loan Combination is involved) the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder(s) if the applicable Master Servicer determines that any Borrower under a Serviced Mortgage Loan has failed to maintain insurance required under (or that the applicable Master Servicer has required pursuant to a provision that entitles the lender to reasonably require insurance under) the related Mortgage Loan Documents and such failure materially and adversely affects such Mortgage Loan and/or the interest of the Trust in the related Mortgaged Property or if any Borrower under a Serviced Mortgage Loan has notified the applicable Master Servicer in writing that such Borrower does not intend to maintain such insurance and the applicable Master Servicer has determined that such failure materially and adversely affects such Mortgage Loan and/or the interest of the Trust in the related Mortgaged Property.



 (b) Subject to Sections 3.17(b), and/or 3.24, as applicable, with respect to each Administered REO Property, the applicable Special Servicer shall use reasonable efforts, consistent with the Servicing Standard, to maintain with Qualified Insurers having the Required Claims-Paying Ratings (a) a fire and casualty extended coverage insurance policy, which does







 not provide for reduction due to depreciation, in an amount that is at least equal to the lesser of (i) the full replacement cost of improvements at such Administered REO Property or (ii) the outstanding principal balance of the related REO Mortgage Loan, but, in any event, in an amount sufficient to avoid the application of any co-insurance clause, (b) a comprehensive general liability insurance policy with coverage comparable to that which would be required under prudent lending requirements and in an amount not less than $1,000,000 per occurrence and (c) to the extent consistent with the Servicing Standard, a business interruption or rental loss insurance covering revenues or rents for a period of at least twelve (12) months (or at least eighteen (18) months, in the case of an Administered REO Property whose related REO Mortgage Loan had an initial principal balance exceeding $35,000,000), in each case if so required pursuant to the related Mortgage Loan Documents; provided, that both of the following conditions and/or limitations shall apply:



 (A) the applicable Special Servicer shall not be required to maintain or obtain the insurance coverage otherwise described above unless the Trustee has an insurable interest; and



 (B) the applicable Special Servicer shall not be required to maintain or obtain the insurance coverage otherwise described above to the extent that the coverage is not available at commercially reasonable rates and consistent with the Servicing Standard.



 All such insurance policies maintained as described above shall contain (if they insure against loss to property) a "standard" mortgagee clause, with loss payable to the applicable Master Servicer (or the applicable sub-servicer) on behalf of the Trustee, in the case of insurance maintained in respect of a Serviced Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination, or shall name the Trustee as the insured, with loss payable to the applicable Special Servicer on behalf of the Trustee, in the case of insurance maintained in respect of an Administered REO Property.  Any amounts collected by the applicable Master Servicer or the applicable Special Servicer, as applicable, under any such policies (other than amounts to be applied to the restoration or repair of the related Mortgaged Property or REO Property or amounts to be released to the related Borrower, in each case in accordance with the Servicing Standard) shall be deposited in the Collection Account (or, to the extent the loss affects a Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder, in the Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Custodial Account, as applicable), in each case as appropriate in accordance with Section 3.04, subject to withdrawal pursuant to Section 3.05, in the case of amounts received in respect of a Serviced Mortgage Loan, or in the REO Account of the applicable Special Servicer, subject to withdrawal pursuant to Section 3.16(c), in the case of amounts received in respect of an Administered REO Property.  Any cost incurred by the applicable Master Servicer or the applicable Special Servicer in maintaining any such insurance shall not, for purposes hereof, including calculating monthly distributions to Certificateholders, be added to unpaid principal balance or Stated Principal Balance of the related Serviced Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination, notwithstanding that the terms of such Serviced Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination so permit; provided, that this sentence shall not limit the rights of the applicable Master Servicer or the applicable Special Servicer on behalf of the Trust (and, if applicable, the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder(s)) to enforce any obligations of the related Borrower under such Serviced Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination.  Costs to the applicable Master Servicer







 or the applicable Special Servicer of maintaining insurance policies pursuant to this Section 3.07 shall (subject to Section 3.11(h) and Section 3.19(b)) be paid by, and reimbursable to, the applicable Master Servicer or the applicable Special Servicer, as the case may be, as a Servicing Advance.



 (c) If (i) the applicable Master Servicer or the applicable Special Servicer shall obtain and maintain, or cause to be obtained and maintained, a blanket policy or master force-placed policy insuring against hazard losses on all of the Serviced Mortgage Loans, Serviced Loan Combination or Administered REO Properties, as applicable, then, to the extent such policy (A) is obtained from a Qualified Insurer having the Required Claims-Paying Ratings, and (B) provides protection equivalent to the individual policies otherwise required herein and in the Mortgage Loan Documents or (ii) the applicable Master Servicer or the applicable Special Servicer has long-term unsecured debt obligations that are rated not lower than ''A-'' by Fitch, "A3" by Moody's and an equivalent rating by KBRA (if then rated by KBRA) or has received a Rating Agency Confirmation from each Rating Agency with respect to which such rating is not satisfied, and the applicable Master Servicer or the applicable Special Servicer, as the case may be, self-insures for its obligation to maintain the individual policies otherwise required, the applicable Master Servicer or the applicable Special Servicer, as the case may be, shall conclusively be deemed to have satisfied its obligation to cause hazard insurance to be maintained on the related Mortgaged Properties or REO Properties, as applicable.  Such a blanket or master force-placed policy may contain a deductible clause (not in excess of a customary amount), in which case the applicable Master Servicer or the applicable Special Servicer, as the case may be, whichever maintains such policy, shall, if there shall not have been maintained on any Mortgaged Property securing a Serviced Mortgage Loan, Serviced Loan Combination or any Administered REO Property thereunder a hazard insurance policy complying with the requirements of Section 3.07(a), and there shall have been one or more losses that would have been covered by such an individual policy, promptly deposit into the Collection Account (or, to the extent the loss affects a Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder, in the Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Custodial Account, as applicable) maintained by the applicable Master Servicer, from its own funds without any right of reimbursement from the Trust, the amount not otherwise payable under the blanket or master force-placed policy in connection with such loss or losses because of such deductible clause to the extent that any such deductible exceeds the deductible limitation that pertained to the related Serviced Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination (or, in the absence of any such deductible limitation, the deductible limitation for an individual policy which is consistent with the Servicing Standard).  The applicable Master Servicer and the applicable Special Servicer shall each prepare and present, on behalf of itself, the Trustee and Certificateholders and, if applicable, the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder(s), claims under any such blanket or master force-placed policy maintained by it in a timely fashion in accordance with the terms of such policy.



 (d) With respect to each Performing Serviced Mortgage Loan that is subject to an Environmental Insurance Policy, if the applicable Master Servicer has actual knowledge of any event (an "Insured Environmental Event") giving rise to a claim under an Environmental Insurance Policy, the applicable Master Servicer shall notify the applicable Special Servicer to such effect and the applicable Master Servicer shall take reasonable actions as are in accordance with the Servicing Standard and the terms and conditions of such Environmental Insurance







 Policy to make a claim thereunder and achieve the payment of all amounts to which the Trust is entitled thereunder.  With respect to each Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan that is subject to an Environmental Insurance Policy, if the applicable Special Servicer has actual knowledge of any event giving rise to a claim under an Environmental Insurance Policy, the applicable Special Servicer shall notify the applicable Master Servicer, which shall take reasonable actions as are in accordance with the Servicing Standard and the terms and conditions of such Environmental Insurance Policy to make a claim thereunder and achieve the payment of all amounts to which the Trust is entitled thereunder.  With respect to each Administered REO Property that is subject to an Environmental Insurance Policy, if the applicable Special Servicer has actual knowledge of any event giving rise to a claim under an Environmental Insurance Policy, the applicable Special Servicer shall take reasonable actions as are in accordance with the Servicing Standard and the terms and conditions of such Environmental Insurance Policy to make a claim thereunder and achieve the payment of all amounts to which the Trust is entitled thereunder.  Any legal fees or other out-of-pocket costs incurred in accordance with the Servicing Standard in connection with any claim under an Environmental Insurance Policy described above (whether by the applicable Master Servicer or the applicable Special Servicer) shall be (subject to Section 3.11(h) and Section 3.19(b)) paid by, and reimbursable to, the applicable Master Servicer or the applicable Special Servicer, as the case may be, as a Servicing Advance.



 (e) The applicable Master Servicer and the applicable Special Servicer shall each at all times during the term of this Agreement (or, in the case of the applicable Special Servicer, at all times during the term of this Agreement during which Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans and/or Administered REO Properties exist as part of the Trust Fund) keep in force with a Qualified Insurer having the Required Claims-Paying Ratings, a fidelity bond in such form and amount as are consistent with the Servicing Standard.  The applicable Master Servicer or the applicable Special Servicer shall be deemed to have complied with the foregoing provision if an Affiliate thereof has such fidelity bond coverage and, by the terms of such fidelity bond, the coverage afforded thereunder extends to the applicable Master Servicer or the applicable Special Servicer, as the case may be.  Such fidelity bond shall provide that it may not be canceled without ten (10) days' prior written notice to the Trustee.  So long as the long-term unsecured debt obligations of the applicable Master Servicer or applicable Special Servicer are rated not lower than ''A-'' by Fitch, "A3" by Moody's and the equivalent rating by KBRA (if then rated by KBRA), or the applicable Master Servicer or the applicable Special Servicer has received a Rating Agency Confirmation from each Rating Agency with respect to which such rating is not satisfied, the applicable Master Servicer or the applicable Special Servicer, as the case may be, may self-insure with respect to the fidelity bond coverage required as described above, in which case it shall not be required to maintain an insurance policy with respect to such coverage.



 The applicable Master Servicer and the applicable Special Servicer shall each at all times during the term of this Agreement (or, in the case of the applicable Special Servicer, at all times during the term of this Agreement during which Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans and/or Administered REO Properties exist as part of the Trust Fund) also keep in force with a Qualified Insurer having the Required Claims-Paying Ratings, a policy or policies of insurance covering loss occasioned by the errors and omissions of its officers and employees in connection with its servicing obligations hereunder, which policy or policies shall be in such form and amount as are consistent with the Servicing Standard.  The applicable Master Servicer or the







 applicable Special Servicer shall be deemed to have complied with the foregoing provision if an Affiliate thereof has such policy or policies and, by the terms of such policy or policies, the coverage afforded thereunder extends to the applicable Master Servicer or the applicable Special Servicer, as the case may be.  Any such errors and omissions policy shall provide that it may not be canceled without ten (10) days' prior written notice to the Trustee.  So long as the long-term unsecured debt obligations of the applicable Master Servicer or the applicable Special Servicer are rated not lower than ''A-'' by Fitch, "A3" by Moody's and the equivalent rating by KBRA (if then rated by KBRA), or the applicable Master Servicer or the applicable Special Servicer has received a Rating Agency Confirmation from each Rating Agency with respect to which such rating is not satisfied, the applicable Master Servicer or the applicable Special Servicer, as the case may be, may self-insure with respect to the errors and omissions coverage required as described above, in which case it shall not be required to maintain an insurance policy with respect to such coverage.

 Notwithstanding the foregoing, and regardless of whether a particular Co-op Mortgage Loan contains specific provisions regarding the incurrence of subordinate debt, or prohibits the incurrence of subordinate debt, or requires the consent of the Mortgagee in order to incur subordinate debt, the NCB Master Servicer may, nevertheless, in accordance with the Servicing Standard, without the need to obtain any consent or approval hereunder (and without the need to obtain a Rating Agency Confirmation), permit the related Borrower to incur subordinate debt if the NCB, FSB Subordinate Debt Conditions have been met; provided that, subject to the related Mortgage Loan Documents and applicable law, the NCB Master Servicer shall not waive any right it has, or grant any consent it is otherwise entitled to withhold, in accordance with any related "due-on-encumbrance" clause under any Mortgage Loan, pursuant







 to this paragraph, unless in any such case, all associated costs and expenses are covered without any expense to the Trust.  Further notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event will the NCB Master Servicer's approval of an assignment and assumption or further encumbrance be conditioned on the approval or absence of objection from the applicable Special Servicer (or the applicable Special Servicer interacting with the Subordinate Class Representative in connection with such Master Servicer approval) if the NCB, FSB Subordinate Debt Conditions have been met with respect to a Co-op Mortgage Loan.



 (b) In connection with any permitted assumption of any Serviced Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination or waiver of a "due-on-sale" or "due-on-encumbrance" clause thereunder, the applicable Master Servicer (in the case of a Performing Serviced Mortgage Loan other than a Special Servicer Decision or a Material Action with respect to a Performing Serviced Mortgage Loan) or the applicable Special Servicer (in the case of a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan and with respect to any such matter that constitutes a Special Servicer Decision or a Material Action on a Performing Serviced Mortgage Loan) shall prepare all documents necessary and appropriate for such purposes and shall coordinate with the related Borrower for the due execution and delivery of such documents.

 paid, such costs shall be paid by and reimbursed to the applicable Master Servicer as an Additional Trust Fund Expense).  The applicable Master Servicer shall be entitled to collect and receive from Borrowers any customary fees in connection with such transfers of interest as Additional Master Servicing Compensation.



 Section 3.09 Realization Upon Defaulted Serviced Mortgage Loans.



 (a) The applicable Special Servicer shall, subject to Sections 3.09(b), 3.09(c), 3.09(d), Section 3.24, Section 3.26 and/or Section 3.28, as applicable, exercise reasonable efforts, consistent with the Servicing Standard, to foreclose upon or otherwise comparably convert the ownership of the real property and other collateral securing any Serviced Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination that comes into and continues in default and as to which no satisfactory arrangements can be made for collection of delinquent payments, including pursuant to Section 3.20.  In connection with the foregoing, in the event of a default under any Serviced Mortgage Loan, Serviced Loan Combination or Cross-Collateralized Group that is secured by real properties located in multiple states, and such states include California or another state with a statute, rule or regulation comparable to California's "one action rule," then the applicable Special Servicer shall consult Independent counsel regarding the order and manner in which the applicable Special Servicer should foreclose upon or comparably proceed against such properties.

Subject to the foregoing, however, a Mortgaged Property may be acquired through a single-member limited liability company.  In addition, except as permitted under Section 3.17(a), the applicable Special Servicer shall not acquire any personal property on behalf of the Trust (and, in the case of a Serviced Loan Combination, the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder(s) pursuant to this Section 3.09 unless either:



 (i) such personal property is incident to real property (within the meaning of Section 856(e)(1) of the Code) so acquired by the applicable Special Servicer; or



 (ii) the applicable Special Servicer shall have obtained an Opinion of Counsel (the cost of which shall be covered by, and reimbursable as, a Servicing Advance) to the effect that the holding of such personal property as part of the Trust Fund will not result in an Adverse REMIC Event with respect to any REMIC Pool or an Adverse Grantor Trust Event with respect to the Grantor Trust Pool.



 (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 3.09, the applicable Special Servicer shall not, on behalf of the Trust (and, in the case of a Serviced Loan Combination, the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder(s)), have a receiver of rents appointed with respect to a Mortgaged Property, or obtain title to a Mortgaged Property by foreclosure, deed in lieu of foreclosure or otherwise, or take any other action with respect to any Mortgaged Property, if, as a result of any such action, the Trustee, on behalf of the Certificateholders, could, in the reasonable judgment of the applicable Special Servicer, exercised in accordance with the Servicing Standard, be considered to hold title to, to be a "mortgagee-in-possession" of, or to be an "owner" or "operator" of such Mortgaged Property within the meaning of CERCLA or any comparable law, unless:



 (i) the applicable Special Servicer has previously determined in accordance with the Servicing Standard, based on a Phase I Environmental Assessment (and any additional environmental testing that the applicable Special Servicer deems necessary and prudent) of such Mortgaged Property conducted by an Independent Person who regularly conducts Phase I Environmental Assessments and performed during the nine-month period preceding any such acquisition of title or other action, that such Mortgaged Property is in compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and there are no circumstances or conditions present at the Mortgaged Property relating to the use, management or disposal of Hazardous Materials for which investigation, testing, monitoring, containment, clean-up or remediation could be required under any applicable environmental laws and regulations; or

 (c) As compensation for its activities hereunder, the applicable Special Servicer shall be entitled to receive monthly the Special Servicing Fee with respect to each Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan (in the case of a Serviced Loan Combination, including both the interest therein represented by the related Mortgage Loan and interest therein represented by the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan), and each successor REO Mortgage Loan (in the case of a Serviced Loan Combination, including both the interest therein represented by the related Mortgage Loan and the interest therein represented by the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan) thereto that relates to an Administered REO Property.  As to each such Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan and REO Mortgage Loan (in the case of a Serviced Loan Combination, including both the interest therein represented by the related Mortgage Loan and the interest therein represented by the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan), for any particular calendar month or applicable portion thereof, the Special Servicing Fee shall accrue at the Special Servicing Fee Rate on the Stated Principal Balance of such Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan or related REO Mortgage Loan, as the case may be, and shall be calculated on the same Interest Accrual Basis as is applicable for such Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan or REO Mortgage Loan, as the case may be, and for the same number of days respecting which any related interest payment due on such Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan or deemed to be due on such REO Mortgage Loan is computed under the terms of the related Mortgage Note (as such terms may be changed or modified at any time following the Closing Date) and applicable law.  To the extent attributable to a Mortgage Loan, the Special Servicing Fee with respect to any Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan or any successor REO Mortgage Loan thereto shall cease to accrue as of the date a Liquidation Event occurs in respect of such Mortgage Loan or, in the case of such a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan, as of the date that such Mortgage Loan becomes a Corrected Mortgage Loan.  To the extent attributable to a Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan, the Special Servicing Fee with respect to any Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan or any successor REO Mortgage Loan thereto shall cease to accrue as of the date a Liquidation Event occurs in respect of the related Mortgage Loan or REO Property included in the same Serviced







 Loan Combination or, in the case of such a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan, as of the date the related Mortgage Loan becomes a Corrected Mortgage Loan.  Earned but unpaid Special Servicing Fees with respect to Mortgage Loans that are Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans and REO Mortgage Loans shall be payable (pursuant to Section 3.05(a)) monthly first out of related Liquidation Proceeds, Insurance Proceeds and/or Condemnation Proceeds, if any, and then out of general collections on the Mortgage Loans and any REO Properties on deposit in the Collection Account and earned but unpaid Special Servicing Fees with respect to a Serviced Loan Combination or any successor REO Mortgage Loan with respect thereto shall be payable in accordance with the related Intercreditor Agreement and first, out of the proceeds of such Serviced Loan Combination on deposit in the Collection Account and/or the Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Custodial Account (as applicable) and then out of general collections in the Collection Account (following which the applicable Special Servicer shall use efforts in accordance with the Servicing Standard to exercise promptly the rights of the Trust Fund under the related Intercreditor Agreement to obtain reimbursement from the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder (or if the Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan is held by an Other Securitization, from such Other Securitization) of such Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan's allocable share of such Special Servicing Fees to the extent so paid from general collections in the Collection Account).



 As further compensation for its activities hereunder, the applicable Special Servicer shall be entitled to receive the Workout Fee with respect to each Serviced Mortgage Loan and any related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan that is a Corrected Mortgage Loan, unless the basis on which the related Serviced Mortgage Loan became a Corrected Mortgage Loan was the remediation of a circumstance or condition relating to the related Responsible Repurchase Party's obligation to repurchase the related Mortgage Loan pursuant to the related Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement, as applicable, in which case, if such Mortgage Loan is repurchased within the Initial Resolution Period (and, if applicable any Resolution Extension Period as is permitted under Section 2.03) no Workout Fee will be payable from or based upon the receipt of, any Purchase Price paid by the related Responsible Repurchase Party in satisfaction of such repurchase obligation.  As to each such Corrected Mortgage Loan, the Workout Fee shall be payable out of, and shall be calculated by application of the Workout Fee Rate to, each payment of interest (other than Default Interest and Post-ARD Additional Interest) and principal received from the related Borrower on such Corrected Mortgage Loan for so long as it remains a Corrected Mortgage Loan, except that any Workout Fees earned with respect to any Serviced Loan Combination or any successor REO Mortgage Loan with respect thereto and attributable to the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan shall be payable in accordance with the related Intercreditor Agreement and solely out of the proceeds of such Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan; provided, that any Workout Fees earned with respect to a Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan or any successor REO Mortgage Loan with respect thereto will be payable out of any proceeds on or with respect to such Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan and/or the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder's share of proceeds on such related REO Property prior to any proceeds on or with respect to the Mortgage Loan and/or the Trust Fund's share of proceeds on such related REO Property as otherwise described above.  In addition, the determination and payment of the Workout Fee with respect to any Corrected Mortgage Loan (in the case of a Serviced Loan Combination, including both the interest therein represented by the related Mortgage Loan and the interest therein represented by the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan) for which the amount of related Offsetting Modification







 Fees is greater than zero shall be adjusted in the following manner:  (i) the Workout Fee Rate shall be multiplied by the aggregate amount of all the scheduled payments of principal and interest scheduled to become due under the terms of such Corrected Mortgage Loan during the period from the date when such Mortgage Loan (or Serviced Loan Combination, as applicable) becomes a Corrected Mortgage Loan to and including the Stated Maturity Date of such Corrected Mortgage Loan, without discounting for present value (the resulting product, the "Workout Fee Projected Amount"); and (ii) either (a) if the amount of the Offsetting Modification Fees for such Corrected Mortgage Loan is greater than or equal to the Workout Fee Projected Amount for such Corrected Mortgage Loan, the applicable Special Servicer shall not be entitled to any payments in respect of the Workout Fee with respect to such Corrected Mortgage Loan, or (b) if the amount of Offsetting Modification Fees for such Corrected Mortgage Loan is less than the Workout Fee Projected Amount, the applicable Special Servicer shall be entitled to payments of the Workout Fee with respect to such Corrected Mortgage Loan, on the terms and conditions otherwise set forth in this Agreement without regard to this sentence, until the cumulative amount of such payments is equal to the excess of the Workout Fee Projected Amount over the Offsetting Modification Fees, after which date the applicable Special Servicer shall not be entitled to any further payments in respect of the Workout Fee for such Corrected Mortgage Loan.  The Workout Fee with respect to any Corrected Mortgage Loan shall cease to be payable if such Corrected Mortgage Loan again becomes a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan or if the related Mortgaged Property becomes an REO Property; provided that a new Workout Fee would become payable if and when such Serviced Mortgage Loan again became a Corrected Mortgage Loan after having again become a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan.  If the applicable Special Servicer is terminated or resigns, the applicable Special Servicer shall retain the right (and the applicable successor Special Servicer shall not have the right) to receive any and all Workout Fees payable in respect of (i) any Serviced Mortgage Loans or Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan serviced by the applicable Special Servicer that became Corrected Mortgage Loans during the period that it acted as the applicable Special Servicer and that were still Corrected Mortgage Loans at the time of such termination or resignation and (ii) unless the applicable Special Servicer was terminated for cause (in which case only clause (i) above shall apply), any Serviced Mortgage Loans or Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan that constitute Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans for which the applicable Special Servicer has resolved the circumstances and/or conditions causing any such Mortgage Loan or Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan to be a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan such that the Mortgage Loan or Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan would be deemed a Corrected Mortgage Loan but for the Borrower having not yet made, as of the date of such termination or resignation, three timely Monthly Payments required by the terms of the workout; provided, that in either case no other event has occurred as of the time of the applicable Special Servicer's termination or resignation that would otherwise cause such Mortgage Loan to again become a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan.  The Workout Fee with respect to any Corrected Mortgage Loan shall be capped in accordance with the last paragraph of this Section 3.11(c).



 As further compensation for its activities hereunder, the applicable Special Servicer shall also be entitled to receive a Liquidation Fee with respect to each Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan (in the case of a Serviced Loan Combination, including both the interest therein represented by the related Mortgage Loan and the interest therein represented by the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan) as to which any full, partial or discounted payoff is received from the related Borrower and with respect to each Specially Serviced







 Mortgage Loan or Administered REO Property (in the case of a Serviced Loan Combination, including in each case both the interest therein represented by the related Mortgage Loan and the interest therein represented by the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan) as to which the applicable Special Servicer receives any Condemnation Proceeds, Insurance Proceeds or Liquidation Proceeds and (without duplication) each Serviced Mortgage Loan as to which the applicable Special Servicer otherwise receives any Condemnation Proceeds, Insurance Proceeds or Liquidation Proceeds; provided that, if a Liquidation Fee otherwise becomes payable with respect to a Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination, then such Liquidation Fee payable to the applicable Special Servicer with respect to such Mortgage Loan in the aggregate shall be reduced by the amount of any Offsetting Modification Fees; provided, further, that if a Serviced Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination becomes a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan only because of an event described in clause (a) of the definition of "Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan" and the related proceeds are received within 90 days following the related Stated Maturity Date in connection with the full and final payoff or refinancing of the related Serviced Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination, in each case the applicable Special Servicer will not be entitled to collect a Liquidation Fee, but may collect and retain appropriate fees from the related Borrower in connection with such liquidation; provided, further, that the Liquidation Fee shall be zero with respect to: (A) the purchase or other acquisition of any Serviced Mortgage Loan or REO Mortgage Loan by any Subordinate Class Certificateholder(s), the Sole Certificateholder(s), the applicable Master Servicer or the applicable Special Servicer pursuant to Section 9.01, (B) (i) the repurchase or replacement of any Serviced Mortgage Loan by a Responsible Repurchase Party pursuant to the related Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement as a result of a Material Breach or Material Document Defect, if the repurchase or replacement occurs prior to the end of the period, as the same may be extended, in which such Responsible Repurchase Party must cure, repurchase or substitute for such Serviced Mortgage Loan or (ii) the repurchase or replacement of any Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan by a responsible repurchase party pursuant to the related mortgage loan purchase agreement as a result of a material breach or material document defect thereunder, if the repurchase or replacement occurs prior to the end of the period, as the same may be extended, in which such responsible repurchase party must cure, repurchase or substitute for such Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan, (C) in the case of a Mortgage Loan included in a Serviced Loan Combination or any related Administered REO Property, the purchase or other acquisition of any such Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan or Administered REO Property by any related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder(s) pursuant to or as contemplated by Section 3.26 (provided that a Liquidation Fee shall be payable in connection with such a purchase by a Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder relating to a Serviced Loan Combination pursuant to the defaulted loan purchase option granted to it under the related Intercreditor Agreement if the purchase occurs more than ninety (90) days after the later of (x) the date when the related Mortgage Loan becomes a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan and (y) the date when such Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder receives the initial written notice from the applicable Special Servicer that such transfer to special servicing has occurred) or (D) the purchase of any such Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan or Administered REO Property by any other creditor of the related Borrower or any of its Affiliates or other equity holders pursuant to a right under the related Mortgage Loan Documents (including, without limitation, the purchase of any such Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan or Administered REO Property by a mezzanine lender of the related Borrower or any of its Affiliates pursuant to the related mezzanine intercreditor or other similar







 agreement) (provided that such right is exercised within ninety (90) days after such creditor's purchase option first becomes exercisable and in the manner required under such Mortgage Loan Documents or, with respect to any purchase by a mezzanine lender pursuant to the related mezzanine intercreditor agreement, if the purchase occurs within ninety (90) days after the later of (x) the date when the related Serviced Mortgage Loan becomes a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan and (y) the date when such mezzanine lender receives the initial written notice from the applicable Special Servicer that such transfer to special servicing has occurred)).  As to each such Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan or Administered REO Property for which the applicable Special Servicer is entitled to a Liquidation Fee as set forth above, such Liquidation Fee shall be payable out of, and shall be calculated by application of the Liquidation Fee Rate to, any such full, partial or discounted payoff, Condemnation Proceeds, Insurance Proceeds and/or Liquidation Proceeds received or collected in respect thereof (other than any portion of such payment or proceeds that represents Default Charges or Post-ARD Additional Interest) provided, that any Liquidation Fees earned with respect to a Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan in a Serviced Loan Combination shall be payable out of any collections on or with respect to such related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan and/or the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder's share of collections on any related Administered REO Property prior to payment out of any collections otherwise described above).  The Liquidation Fee with respect to any such Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan shall not be payable if such Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan becomes a Corrected Mortgage Loan.  The Liquidation Fee with respect to any Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan shall be capped in accordance with the last paragraph of this Section 3.11(c).



 The applicable Special Servicer's right to receive any Special Servicing Fee, Workout Fee and/or Liquidation Fee to which it is entitled may not be transferred in whole or in part except in connection with the transfer of all of the applicable Special Servicer's responsibilities and obligations under this Agreement and except as otherwise expressly provided herein, including as provided in the next sentence.  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the applicable Special Servicer may enter into one or more arrangements with the Majority Subordinate Certificateholder and/or the Subordinate Class Representative, or any other Person(s) that may be entitled to remove or replace the applicable Special Servicer, to provide for the payment by the applicable Special Servicer to such party or parties of certain of the applicable Special Servicer's compensation hereunder, whether in consideration of the applicable Special Servicer's appointment or continuation of appointment as the applicable Special Servicer in connection with this Agreement or the related Intercreditor Agreement, limitations on such parties' right to terminate or replace the applicable Special Servicer in connection with this Agreement or the related Intercreditor Agreement or otherwise.  If the applicable Special Servicer exercises the authority set forth in the preceding sentence, any and all obligations pursuant to any such agreement shall constitute obligations solely of the applicable Special Servicer and not of any other party hereto.  If the applicable Special Servicer enters into such an agreement and one or more other Person(s) thereafter becomes the applicable Majority Subordinate Certificateholders, the Subordinate Class Representative, or becomes entitled to remove or replace the applicable Special Servicer, as applicable, such agreement shall not be binding on such other Person(s), nor may it limit the rights that otherwise inure to the benefit of such other Person(s) as the Majority Subordinate Certificateholder and/or the Subordinate Class Representative, as applicable, or as a party otherwise entitled to remove or replace the







 applicable Special Servicer, in the absence of such other Persons(s)' express written consent, which may be granted or withheld in their sole discretion.



 The total amount of Workout Fees, Liquidation Fees and Modification Fees received by the applicable Special Servicer with respect to the workout, liquidation (including partial liquidation), modification, extension, waiver or amendment of a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan (or Serviced Loan Combination that is in special servicing) or REO Mortgage Loan shall be subject to an aggregate cap equal to the greater of (i) $1,000,000 and (ii) 1.00% of the Stated Principal Balance of the subject Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan (or Serviced Loan Combination that is in special servicing) or REO Mortgage Loan.

 (ix) a portion of Net Default Charges as set forth in Section 3.25.



 To the extent that any of the amounts described in clauses (i) through (vii) of the preceding paragraph are collected by the applicable Master Servicer, the applicable Master Servicer shall promptly pay such amounts to the applicable Special Servicer and shall not be required to deposit such amounts in the Collection Account or the Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Custodial Account pursuant to Section 3.04.



 (e) The applicable Master Servicer and the applicable Special Servicer shall each be required (subject to Section 3.11(h) below) to pay out of its own funds all expenses incurred by it in connection with its servicing activities hereunder (including payment of any amounts due and owing to any Sub-Servicers retained by it (including any termination fees) and the premiums for any blanket policy or the standby fee or similar premium, if any, for any master force-placed policy obtained by it insuring against hazard losses pursuant to Section 3.07(c)), if and to the extent such expenses are not payable directly out of the applicable Collection Account, the Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Custodial Account, any Servicing Account, Reserve Account or REO Account, and neither the applicable Master Servicer nor the applicable Special Servicer shall be entitled to reimbursement for any such expense incurred by it except as expressly provided in this Agreement.  If the applicable Master Servicer is required to make any Servicing Advance hereunder at the discretion of the applicable Special Servicer in accordance with Section 3.19 or otherwise, the applicable Special Servicer shall promptly provide the applicable Master Servicer with such documentation regarding the subject Servicing Advance as the applicable Master Servicer may reasonably request.







 (f) If the applicable Master Servicer or, as contemplated by Section 3.19, the applicable Special Servicer is required under this Agreement to make a Servicing Advance, but fails to do so within ten (10) days after such Advance is required to be made, the Trustee shall, if it has actual knowledge of such failure on the part of the applicable Master Servicer or the applicable Special Servicer, as the case may be, give notice of such failure to the defaulting party.  If such Advance is not made by the applicable Master Servicer or the applicable Special Servicer, as the case may be, within one Business Day after receipt of such a notice, then (subject to Section 3.11(h) below) the Trustee shall make such Advance.



 (g) The applicable Master Servicer, the applicable Special Servicer and the Trustee shall each be entitled to receive interest at the Reimbursement Rate in effect from time to time, accrued on the amount of each Servicing Advance made thereby (with its own funds), for so long as such Servicing Advance is outstanding (it being acknowledged that Advance Interest shall not accrue on Unliquidated Advances related to prior Servicing Advances).  Such interest with respect to any Servicing Advances shall be payable:  (i) first, in accordance with Sections 3.05 and 3.25, out of any Default Charges subsequently collected on or in respect of the particular Serviced Mortgage Loan, Serviced Loan Combination or Administered REO Property as to which such Servicing Advance relates; and (ii) then, after such Servicing Advance is reimbursed, but only if and to the extent that such Default Charges are insufficient to cover such Advance Interest, out of general collections on the Mortgage Loans and REO Properties on deposit in the Collection Account.  The applicable Master Servicer shall (subject to the operation of Section 3.05(a)(II)) reimburse itself, the applicable Special Servicer or the Trustee, as appropriate, for any Servicing Advance made by any such Person with respect to any Serviced Mortgage Loan or Administered REO Property as soon as practicable after funds available for such purpose are deposited in the Collection Account or the Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Custodial Account, as applicable.



 (h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, none of the applicable Master Servicer, the applicable Special Servicer or the Trustee shall be required to make any Servicing Advance that would, if made, constitute a Nonrecoverable Servicing Advance.  The determination by any Person with an obligation hereunder to make Servicing Advances that it has made a Nonrecoverable Servicing Advance or that any proposed Servicing Advance, if made, would constitute a Nonrecoverable Servicing Advance, shall be made by such Person in its reasonable, good faith judgment.  In making such recoverability determination, such Person will be entitled to consider (among other things) the obligations of the Borrower under the terms of the related Serviced Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination as it may have been modified, to consider (among other things) the related Mortgaged Properties in their "as is" or then-current conditions and occupancies, as modified by such party's assumptions regarding the possibility and effects of future adverse change with respect to such Mortgaged Properties, to estimate and consider (among other things) future expenses and to estimate and consider (among other things) the timing of recoveries.  In addition, any such Person may update or change its recoverability determinations at any time and may obtain any analysis, Appraisals or market value estimates or other information in the possession of the applicable Special Servicer for such purposes.  Any determination by any Person with an obligation hereunder to make Servicing Advances that it has made a Nonrecoverable Servicing Advance or that any proposed Servicing Advance, if made, would constitute a Nonrecoverable Servicing Advance, shall be evidenced by an Officer's Certificate delivered promptly to the Depositor, the Certificate Administrator, the







 Trustee (unless it is the Person making such determination), the applicable Special Servicer, the Majority Subordinate Certificateholder and the Subordinate Class Representative and, if the Serviced Loan Combination is involved, the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder(s), setting forth the basis for such determination, accompanied by a copy of any Appraisal of the related Mortgaged Property or REO Property performed within the 12 months preceding such determination by a Qualified Appraiser, and, if such reports were used by the applicable Master Servicer or the Trustee to determine that any Servicing Advance is or would be nonrecoverable, further accompanied by any other information, including engineers' reports, environmental surveys or similar reports, that the Person making such determination may have obtained.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, absent bad faith, any such determination as to the recoverability of any Servicing Advance shall be conclusive and binding on the Certificateholders and, in all cases, the Trustee shall be entitled to conclusively rely on any determination of nonrecoverability that may have been made by the applicable Master Servicer or the applicable Special Servicer or, if appropriate, any party under the related Non-Trust Servicing Agreement (in the case of a Non-Trust-Serviced Pooled Mortgage Loan), and the applicable Master Servicer and the applicable Special Servicer shall each be entitled to conclusively rely on any determination of nonrecoverability that may have been made by the other such party or, if appropriate, any party under the related Non-Trust Servicing Agreement (in the case of a Non-Trust-Serviced Pooled Mortgage Loan) with respect to a particular Servicing Advance for any Serviced Mortgage Loan, Serviced Loan Combination or Administered REO Property.  The applicable Special Servicer shall promptly furnish any party required to make Servicing Advances hereunder with any information in its possession regarding the Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans and Administered REO Properties as such party required to make Servicing Advances may reasonably request.  A copy of any such Officer's Certificate (and accompanying information) of the applicable Master Servicer shall also be delivered promptly to the applicable Special Servicer, a copy of any such Officer's Certificate (and accompanying information) of the applicable Special Servicer shall also be promptly delivered to the applicable Master Servicer for the subject Serviced Mortgage Loan, Serviced Loan Combination or Administered REO Property, and a copy of any such Officer's Certificates (and accompanying information) of the Trustee shall also be promptly delivered to the Certificate Administrator, the Subordinate Class Representative, the Majority Subordinate Certificateholder, the applicable Special Servicer, the applicable Master Servicer and, if the Serviced Loan Combination is involved, the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder(s).  The applicable Master Servicer and the applicable Special Servicer shall consider Unliquidated Advances in respect of prior Servicing Advances as outstanding Advances for purposes of recoverability determinations as if such Unliquidated Advance were a Servicing Advance.



 The applicable Special Servicer shall also be entitled to make (but shall not be obligated to make or not make) a determination (subject to the same standards and procedures that apply in connection with a determination by the applicable Master Servicer) to the effect that a prior Servicing Advance (or Unliquidated Advance in respect thereof) previously made hereunder by the applicable Master Servicer or the applicable Special Servicer (or, if applicable, the Trustee) constitutes a Nonrecoverable Servicing Advance or that any proposed Servicing Advance by the applicable Master Servicer or the applicable Special Servicer (or, if applicable, the Trustee), if made, would constitute a Nonrecoverable Servicing Advance, in which case such determination shall be conclusive and binding on the applicable Master Servicer and the Trustee and such Servicing Advance shall constitute a Nonrecoverable Servicing Advance for all







 purposes of this Agreement and the applicable Master Servicer and the Trustee shall be entitled to conclusively rely on such determination (but this statement shall not be construed to entitle such Special Servicer to reverse any other authorized Person's determination, or to prohibit any such other authorized Person from making a determination, that a Servicing Advance constitutes or would constitute a Nonrecoverable Servicing Advance).  The preceding statement shall not be construed to limit the provision set forth in Section 3.19(b) to the effect that any request by the applicable Special Servicer that the applicable Master Servicer make a Servicing Advance shall be deemed to be a determination by the applicable Special Servicer that such Servicing Advance is not a Nonrecoverable Advance.



 (i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, the applicable Master Servicer may (and, at the direction of the applicable Special Servicer if a Serviced Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination that is a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan or an Administered REO Property is involved, shall) pay directly out of the Collection Account any servicing expense that, if paid by the applicable Master Servicer or the applicable Special Servicer, would constitute a Nonrecoverable Servicing Advance for the subject Serviced Mortgage Loan, Serviced Loan Combination or REO Property; provided that (A) it shall be a condition to such payment that the applicable Master Servicer (or the applicable Special Servicer, if a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan or an Administered REO Property is involved) has determined in accordance with the Servicing Standard that making such payment is in the best interests of the Certificateholders and, if applicable, the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder(s) (as a collective whole), as evidenced by an Officer's Certificate delivered promptly to the Depositor, the Certificate Administrator, the Trustee, the Majority Subordinate Certificateholder and the Subordinate Class Representative and, if the Serviced Loan Combination is involved, the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder(s), setting forth the basis for such determination and accompanied by any information that such Person may have obtained that supports such determination; (B) if such servicing expense relates to the Serviced Loan Combination, the payment of such expense shall be subject to the proviso at the end of the first paragraph of subsection (I) of Section 3.05(a); and (C) such servicing expense shall be deemed to constitute a Nonrecoverable Advance for purposes of subsection (II)(iv) of Section 3.05(a) and the definition of "Principal Distribution Amount" and the terms and conditions set forth in such subsection that are applicable to Nonrecoverable Advances shall apply to such servicing expense.  A copy of any such Officer's Certificate (and accompanying information) of the applicable Master Servicer shall also be delivered promptly to the Subordinate Class Representative (and, if the Serviced Loan Combination is involved, the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder(s)) and the applicable Special Servicer, and a copy of any such Officer's Certificate (and accompanying information) of the applicable Special Servicer shall also be promptly delivered to the applicable Master Servicer and the Subordinate Class Representative (and, if the Serviced Loan Combination is involved, the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder(s)).



 (j) With respect to each Collection Period during which any Disclosable Special Servicer Fees were received by a Special Servicer, such Special Servicer shall deliver to the applicable Master Servicer within one (1) Business Day following the related Determination Date, and, if so delivered, such Master Servicer shall deliver or cause to be delivered to the Certificate Administrator, within three (3) Business Days following the related Determination Date, in each case without charge, a report in EDGAR-Compatible Format (or such other format







 as mutually agreeable between the Certificate Administrator and the applicable Special Servicer) that discloses and contains an itemized listing of any Disclosable Special Servicer Fees received by the applicable Special Servicer or any of its Affiliates, if any, during the related Collection Period.



 (k) The applicable Special Servicer and its Affiliates shall be prohibited from receiving or retaining any compensation or any other remuneration (including, without limitation, in the form of commissions, brokerage fees, rebates, or as a result of any other fee-sharing arrangement) from any Person (including, without limitation, the Trust, any Borrower, any property manager, any guarantor or indemnitor in respect of a Serviced Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination and any purchaser of any Serviced Mortgage Loan, Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan or REO Property) in connection with the disposition, workout or foreclosure of any Serviced Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination, the management or disposition of any REO Property or Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan, or the performance of any other special servicing duties under this Agreement, other than as expressly provided in this Section 3.11; provided that such prohibition shall not apply to Permitted Special Servicer/Affiliate Fees.



 (l) If the Brunswick Square Mortgage Loan becomes a Specially Serviced Loan prior to the securitization of the Brunswick Square Pari Passu Companion Loan, the applicable Special Servicer shall service and administer the Brunswick Square Loan Combination and any related REO Property in the same manner as any other Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan or REO Property and shall be entitled to all rights and compensation earned with respect to such Serviced Loan Combination as Special Servicer of such Serviced Loan Combination.  With respect to the Brunswick Square Loan Combination, prior to the securitization of the Brunswick Square Pari Passu Companion Loan, no other special servicer will be entitled to any such compensation or have such rights and obligations.  If the Brunswick Square Loan Combination is still a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan on the date of the securitization of the Brunswick Square Pari Passu Companion Loan, the Non-Trust Special Servicer and the applicable Special Servicer shall be entitled to compensation with respect to the Brunswick Square Loan Combination as if the applicable Special Servicer were being terminated as Special Servicer and the Non-Trust Special Servicer were replacing it as the successor special servicer pursuant to Section 6.05.

 (a) The applicable Special Servicer shall perform or cause to be performed a physical inspection of a Mortgaged Property securing a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan as soon as practicable (but in any event not later than sixty (60) days) after the subject Serviced Mortgage Loan becomes a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan (and the applicable Special Servicer shall continue to perform or cause to be performed a physical inspection of the subject Mortgaged Property at least once per calendar year thereafter for so long as the subject Serviced Mortgage Loan remains a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan or if such Mortgaged Property becomes an REO Property); provided that the applicable Special Servicer shall be entitled to reimbursement of the reasonable and direct out-of-pocket expenses incurred by it in connection with each such inspection as Servicing Advances or otherwise as contemplated by Section 3.05(a).  Each Master Servicer shall, at its own expense, inspect or cause to be inspected







 each Mortgaged Property for which it is acting as Master Servicer (other than the Mortgaged Property securing a Non-Trust-Serviced Pooled Mortgage Loan) every calendar year beginning in 2015, or every second calendar year beginning in 2016 if the unpaid principal balance of the related Mortgage Loan (or the portion thereof allocated to such Mortgaged Property) is less than $2,000,000; provided that with respect to any Serviced Mortgage Loan (other than a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan) that has an aggregate unpaid principal balance of less than $2,000,000 and has been placed on the CREFC® Servicer Watch List, the applicable Master Servicer shall, at the request and expense of the Subordinate Class Representative, inspect or cause to be inspected the related Mortgaged Property every calendar year not earlier than 2015 so long as such Mortgage Loan continues to be on the CREFC® Servicer Watch List; and provided, further, that the applicable Master Servicer will not be obligated to inspect any particular Mortgaged Property during any one-year or two-year, as applicable, period contemplated above in this sentence, if the applicable Special Servicer has already done so during that period pursuant to the preceding sentence or on any date when the related Mortgage Loan is a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan.  Each of the applicable Master Servicer and the applicable Special Servicer shall prepare and, promptly following preparation, if there has been a material adverse change in the condition of the subject Mortgaged Property or REO Property, as applicable, deliver to the Trustee, the Majority Subordinate Certificateholder, the Subordinate Class Representative, the applicable Master Servicer (if such report is prepared by the applicable Special Servicer) and the applicable Special Servicer (if such report is prepared by the applicable Master Servicer) (and, if a Mortgaged Property or REO Property relates to a Serviced Loan Combination, the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder(s) if and to the extent required under the applicable Intercreditor Agreement), and the Rating Agencies (subject to Section 3.27) a written report of each such inspection performed by it or on its behalf that sets forth in detail the condition of the subject Mortgaged Property and that specifies the occurrence or existence of:  (i) any vacancy in the Mortgaged Property that is, in the reasonable judgment of the applicable Master Servicer or the applicable Special Servicer (or its respective designee), as the case may be, material and is evident from such inspection, (ii) any abandonment of the Mortgaged Property of which it is aware, (iii) any change in the condition or value of the Mortgaged Property that is, in the reasonable judgment of the applicable Master Servicer or the applicable Special Servicer (or its respective designee), as the case may be, material and is evident from such inspection, (iv) any material waste on or deferred maintenance in respect of the Mortgaged Property that is evident from such inspection or (v) any material capital improvements made that are evident from such inspection.  Such report may be in the form of the standard property inspection report (or such other form for the presentation of such information) as may from time to time be recommended by the CREFC® for commercial mortgage-backed securities transactions generally.  Each of the applicable Master Servicer and the applicable Special Servicer shall deliver to the Certificate Administrator and the Trustee (and to the applicable Master Servicer, if done by the applicable Special Servicer) and, upon request, to or at the direction of the Subordinate Class Representative (during any Subordinate Control Period and any Collective Consultation Period), the Majority Subordinate Certificateholder (during any Subordinate Control Period and any Collective Consultation Period), the Trust Advisor (during any Collective Consultation Period and any Senior Consultation Period) and, if applicable, the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder, a copy (or image in suitable electronic media) of each such written report prepared by it, in each case within thirty (30) days following the request (or, if later or if request is not required, within thirty (30) days following the later of completion of the related







 inspection if the inspection is performed by the applicable Master Servicer or the applicable Special Servicer, as appropriate, or receipt of the related inspection report if the inspection is performed by a third party).



 (b) Commencing with respect to the calendar year ending December 31, 2014 (as to annual information) and the calendar quarter ending on June 30, 2014 (as to quarterly information), the applicable Special Servicer, in the case of any Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan, and the applicable Master Servicer, in the case of each Performing Serviced Mortgage Loan, shall make reasonable efforts to collect promptly from each related Borrower quarterly (for each Mortgage Loan other than any Non-Trust-Serviced Pooled Mortgage Loan or any Co-op Mortgage Loan) and annual operating statements, budgets and rent rolls (if applicable) of the related Mortgaged Property, and quarterly (for each Mortgage Loan other than any Non-Trust-Serviced Pooled Mortgage Loan or any Co-op Mortgage Loan) and annual financial statements of such Borrower, whether or not delivery of such items is required pursuant to the terms of the related Mortgage Loan Documents.  The applicable Master Servicer shall deliver images in suitable electronic media of all of the foregoing items so collected or obtained by it to the Persons and in the time and manner set forth in Section 4.02(d).

 Section 3.14 [Reserved].



 Section 3.15 Access to Information.



 (a) Each of the applicable Master Servicer and the applicable Special Servicer shall afford to the OTS, the FDIC, any other banking or insurance regulatory authority that may exercise authority over any Certificateholder or Certificate Owner, the Certificate Administrator, the Trustee, the Trust Advisor (except that the Trust Advisor shall be entitled to such access only from the applicable Special Servicer during any Collective Consultation Period or Senior Consultation Period and only with respect to Mortgage Loan information that the Trust Advisor determined is reasonably necessary in order for it to perform any consultation right or duty it may then currently have with respect to such Mortgage Loan under the other provisions of this Agreement), the Depositor, each Underwriter, the Subordinate Class Representative and the Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder(s), access to any records regarding the Mortgage Loans serviced by it hereunder (or, in the case of a Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder, only the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan) and the servicing thereof within its







 control, except to the extent it is prohibited from doing so by applicable law, the terms of the related Mortgage Loan Documents or contract entered into prior to the Closing Date or to the extent such information is subject to a privilege under applicable law to be asserted on behalf of the Certificateholders.  At the election of the applicable Master Servicer and/or the applicable Special Servicer, such access may be so afforded to the Certificate Administrator, the Trustee, the Depositor, the Trust Advisor, the Subordinate Class Representative, the Majority Subordinate Certificateholder and such related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder, by the delivery of copies of information as requested by such Person and the applicable Master Servicer and/or the applicable Special Servicer, as applicable, shall be permitted to require payment of a sum sufficient to cover the reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred by it in making such copies.  Such access shall otherwise be afforded without charge but only upon reasonable prior written request and during normal business hours at the offices of the applicable Master Servicer or the applicable Special Servicer, as the case may be, designated by it.



 (b) In connection with providing access to information pursuant to subsection (a) of this Section 3.15, Section 4.02(a), Section 8.12(d) or, only with respect to clause (i) below, Section 8.12(g), each of the applicable Master Servicer and the applicable Special Servicer may (i) affix a reasonable disclaimer to any information provided by it for which it is not the original source (without suggesting liability on the part of any other party hereto); (ii) affix to any information provided by it a reasonable statement regarding securities law restrictions on such information and/or condition access to information on the execution of a reasonable confidentiality agreement; (iii) withhold access to confidential information or any intellectual property; and (iv) withhold access to items of information contained in the Servicing File for any Serviced Mortgage Loan if the disclosure of such items is prohibited by applicable law or the provisions of any related Mortgage Loan Documents or would constitute a waiver of the attorney-client privilege.  In connection with providing access to information pursuant to this Section 3.15, the applicable Master Servicer shall require the execution (which may be in electronic form) of a confidentiality agreement substantially in the form of Exhibit K-3 hereto.



 (c) Upon the request of the Subordinate Class Representative made not more frequently than once a month during the normal business hours of the applicable Master Servicer and the applicable Special Servicer, each of the applicable Master Servicer and the applicable Special Servicer shall, without charge, make a knowledgeable Servicing Officer available either by telephone (with Servicing Officers of each of the applicable Master Servicer and the applicable Special Servicer participating simultaneously if the Subordinate Class Representative so requests) or, at the option of the Subordinate Class Representative if it provides reasonable advance notice, at the office of such Servicing Officer, to verbally answer questions from the Subordinate Class Representative regarding the performance and servicing of the Serviced Mortgage Loans and/or Administered REO Properties for which the applicable Master Servicer or the applicable Special Servicer, as the case may be, is responsible.



 (d) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the failure of the applicable Master Servicer or the applicable Special Servicer to disclose any information otherwise required to be disclosed by it pursuant to this Agreement shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement to the extent that the applicable Master Servicer or the applicable Special Servicer, as the case may be, determines, in its reasonable and good faith judgment consistent with the Servicing Standard, that such disclosure would violate applicable







 law or any provision of a Mortgage Loan Document prohibiting disclosure of information with respect to the Mortgage Loans or the Mortgaged Properties, constitute a waiver of the attorney-client privilege on behalf of the Trust or the Trust Fund or otherwise materially harm the Trust or the Trust Fund.



 (e) Neither the applicable Master Servicer nor the applicable Special Servicer shall be liable for providing, disseminating or withholding information in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.  In addition to their other rights hereunder, each of the applicable Master Servicer and the applicable Special Servicer (and their respective employees, attorneys, officers, directors and agents) shall, in each case, be indemnified by the Trust Fund for any claims, losses or expenses arising from any such provision, dissemination or withholding.



 Section 3.16 Title to Administered REO Property; REO Account.



 (a) If title to any Administered REO Property is acquired, the deed or certificate of sale shall be issued to the Trustee or its nominee, on behalf of the Certificateholders (and, in the case of a Serviced Loan Combination, also the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder(s)), or, subject to Section 3.09(b), to a single-member limited liability company of which the Trust is the sole member, which limited liability company is formed or caused to be formed by the applicable Special Servicer at the expense of the Trust (or, in the case of an Administered REO Property related to a Mortgage Loan that is part of a Serviced Loan Combination, the Trust and the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder(s)) for the purpose of taking title to one or more Administered REO Properties pursuant to this Agreement.  Any such limited liability company formed by the applicable Special Servicer shall be a manager-managed limited liability company, with the applicable Special Servicer to serve as the initial manager to manage the property of the limited liability company, including any applicable Administered REO Property, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement as if such property was held directly in the name of the Trust or Trustee under this Agreement.  The applicable Special Servicer shall sell any Administered REO Property in accordance with Section 3.18 by the end of the third calendar year following the year in which the Trust acquires ownership of such Administered REO Property for purposes of Section 860G(a)(8) of the Code, unless the applicable Special Servicer either (i) applies, more than sixty (60) days prior to the expiration of such liquidation period, and is granted (or, pursuant to IRS regulations, deemed to have been granted) an extension of time (an "REO Extension") by the IRS to sell such Administered REO Property or (ii) obtains for the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel, addressed to the Trustee, to the effect that the holding by the Trust of such Administered REO Property subsequent to the end of the third calendar year following the year in which such acquisition occurred will not result in an Adverse REMIC Event with respect to any REMIC Pool or an Adverse Grantor Trust Event with respect to the Grantor Trust Pool.  Regardless of whether the applicable Special Servicer applies for or is granted the REO Extension contemplated by clause (i) of the immediately preceding sentence or obtains the Opinion of Counsel referred to in clause (ii) of such sentence, the applicable Special Servicer shall act in accordance with the Servicing Standard to liquidate the subject Administered REO Property on a timely basis.  If the applicable Special Servicer is granted such REO Extension or obtains such Opinion of Counsel with respect to any Administered REO Property, the applicable Special Servicer shall (i) promptly forward a copy of such REO Extension or Opinion of Counsel to the Trustee, and (ii) sell the subject Administered REO Property within such extended period as is permitted by such REO Extension or







 contemplated by such Opinion of Counsel, as the case may be.  Any expense incurred by the applicable Special Servicer in connection with its applying for and being granted the REO Extension contemplated by clause (i) of the third preceding sentence or its obtaining the Opinion of Counsel contemplated by clause (ii) of the third preceding sentence, and for the creation of and the operating of a limited liability company, shall be covered by, and be reimbursable as, a Servicing Advance.



 (b) The applicable Special Servicer shall segregate and hold all funds collected and received by it in connection with any Administered REO Property separate and apart from its own funds and general assets.  If any REO Acquisition occurs in respect of any Mortgaged Property securing a Serviced Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination, then the applicable Special Servicer shall establish and maintain one or more accounts (collectively, an "REO Account"), to be held on behalf of the Trustee in trust for the benefit of the Certificateholders (or, in the case of any Administered REO Property related to a Serviced Loan Combination, on behalf of both the Certificateholders and the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder(s)), as a collective whole, for the retention of revenues and other proceeds derived from such Administered REO Property.  Each account that constitutes an REO Account shall be an Eligible Account.  The applicable Special Servicer shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, in its REO Account, within one Business Day following receipt, all REO Revenues, Insurance Proceeds, Condemnation Proceeds and Liquidation Proceeds received in respect of an Administered REO Property.  Funds in an REO Account may be invested in Permitted Investments in accordance with Section 3.06.  The applicable Special Servicer is authorized to pay out of related Liquidation Proceeds, Insurance Proceeds and/or Condemnation Proceeds, if any, any Liquidation Expenses incurred in respect of an Administered REO Property and outstanding at the time such proceeds are received, as well as any other items that otherwise may be paid by the applicable Master Servicer out of such Liquidation Proceeds as contemplated by Section 3.05(a).  The applicable Special Servicer shall be entitled to make withdrawals from its REO Account to pay itself, as Additional Special Servicing Compensation, interest and investment income earned in respect of amounts held in such REO Account as provided in Section 3.06(b) (but only to the extent of the Net Investment Earnings, if any, with respect to such REO Account for any Collection Period).  The applicable Special Servicer shall give notice to the other parties hereto of the location of its REO Account when first established and of the new location of such REO Account prior to any change thereof.



 (c) The applicable Special Servicer shall withdraw from the REO Account funds necessary for the proper operation, management, leasing, maintenance and disposition of any Administered REO Property, but only to the extent of amounts on deposit in such REO Account relating to such Administered REO Property.  Monthly within one Business Day following the end of each Collection Period, the applicable Special Servicer shall withdraw from the REO Account and deposit into the Collection Account, or deliver to the applicable Master Servicer for deposit into the Collection Account, the aggregate of all amounts received in respect of each Administered REO Property during such Collection Period that are then on deposit in such REO Account, net of any withdrawals made out of such amounts pursuant to the preceding sentence; provided that (A) in the case of each Administered REO Property, the applicable Special Servicer may retain in its REO Account such portion of such proceeds and collections as may be necessary to maintain a reserve of sufficient funds for the proper operation, management, leasing, maintenance and disposition of such Administered REO Property (including the creation







 of a reasonable reserve for repairs, replacements, necessary capital improvements and other related expenses) and (B) if such Administered REO Property relates to a Serviced Loan Combination, the applicable Master Servicer shall make, from such amounts so deposited or remitted as described above, any deposits into any related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Custodial Account contemplated by Section 3.04(h) or Section 3.04(i), as applicable.  For the avoidance of doubt, such amounts withdrawn from an REO Account and deposited into the Collection Account following the end of each Collection Period pursuant to the preceding sentence shall, upon such deposit, be construed to have been received by the applicable Master Servicer during such Collection Period.



 (d) The applicable Special Servicer shall keep and maintain separate records, on a property-by-property basis, for the purpose of accounting for all deposits to, and withdrawals from, its REO Account pursuant to Section 3.16(b) or 3.16(c).



 (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, this Section 3.16 shall not apply to any REO Property related to a Non-Trust-Serviced Pooled Mortgage Loan.



 Section 3.17 Management of Administered REO Property.



 (a) Prior to the acquisition of title to any Mortgaged Property securing a defaulted Serviced Mortgage Loan, the applicable Special Servicer shall review the operation of such Mortgaged Property and determine the nature of the income that would be derived from such property if it were acquired by the Trust.  If the applicable Special Servicer determines from such review that:



 (i) None of the income from Directly Operating such Mortgaged Property would be subject to tax as "net income from foreclosure property" within the meaning of the REMIC Provisions (such tax referred to herein as an "REO Tax"), then such Mortgaged Property may be Directly Operated by the applicable Special Servicer as Administered REO Property, other than holding such Administered REO Property for sale or lease or performing construction work thereon;



 (ii) Directly Operating such Mortgaged Property as an Administered REO Property could result in income from such property that would be subject to an REO Tax, but that a lease of such property to another party to operate such property, or the performance of some services by an Independent Contractor with respect to such property, or another method of operating such property would not result in income subject to an REO Tax, then the applicable Special Servicer may (provided that in the judgment of the applicable Special Servicer, exercised in accordance with the Servicing Standard, it is commercially reasonable) so lease or otherwise operate such Administered REO Property; or



 (iii) It is reasonable to believe that Directly Operating such property as Administered REO Property could result in income subject to an REO Tax and either (i) that the income or earnings with respect to such REO Property will offset any REO Tax relating to such income or earnings and will maximize the net recovery from the applicable Administered REO Property to the Certificateholders (taking into account that







 any related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder(s) do not have any obligation under the related Intercreditor Agreement to bear the effect of any such REO Tax) or (ii) that no commercially reasonable means exists to operate such property as Administered REO Property without the Trust incurring or possibly incurring an REO Tax on income from such property, then the applicable Special Servicer shall deliver to the Tax Administrator and the Subordinate Class Representative, in writing, a proposed plan (the "Proposed Plan") to manage such property as Administered REO Property.  Such plan shall include potential sources of income and good faith estimates of the amount of income from each such source.  Within a reasonable period of time after receipt of such plan, the Tax Administrator shall consult with the applicable Special Servicer and shall advise the applicable Special Servicer of the Trust's federal income tax reporting position with respect to the various sources of income that the Trust would derive under the Proposed Plan.  In addition, the Tax Administrator shall (to the maximum extent reasonably possible and at a reasonable fee, which fee shall be an expense of the Trust) advise the applicable Special Servicer of the estimated amount of taxes that the Trust would be required to pay with respect to each such source of income.  After receiving the information described in the two preceding sentences from the Tax Administrator, the applicable Special Servicer shall either (A) implement the Proposed Plan (after acquiring the respective Mortgaged Property as Administered REO Property) or (B) manage and operate such property in a manner that would not result in the imposition of an REO Tax on the income derived from such property.



 Subject to Section 3.17(b), the applicable Special Servicer's decision as to how each Administered REO Property shall be managed and operated shall be in accordance with the Servicing Standard.  Neither the applicable Special Servicer nor the Tax Administrator shall be liable to the Certificateholders, the Trustee, the Trust, the other parties hereto, any beneficiaries hereof or each other for errors in judgment made in good faith in the exercise of their discretion while performing their respective responsibilities under this Section 3.17(a) with respect to any Administered REO Property.  Nothing in this Section 3.17(a) is intended to prevent the sale of any Administered REO Property pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions of Section 3.18.



 (b) If title to any Administered REO Property is acquired, the applicable Special Servicer shall manage, conserve, protect and operate such Administered REO Property for the benefit of the Certificateholders (or, in the case of any Administered REO Property related to a Serviced Loan Combination, on behalf of both the Certificateholders and the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder(s)), as a collective whole, solely for the purpose of its prompt disposition and sale in accordance with Section 3.18, in a manner that does not cause such Administered REO Property to fail to qualify as "foreclosure property" within the meaning of Section 860G(a)(8) of the Code or, except as contemplated by Section 3.17(a), result in the receipt by any REMIC Pool of any "income from non-permitted assets" within the meaning of Section 860F(a)(2)(B) of the Code, in an Adverse REMIC Event with respect to any REMIC Pool or an Adverse Grantor Trust Event with respect to the Grantor Trust Pool.  Except as contemplated by Section 3.17(a), the applicable Special Servicer shall not enter into any lease, contract or other agreement with respect to any Administered REO Property that causes the Trust to receive, and (unless required to do so under any lease, contract or agreement to which the applicable Special Servicer or the Trust may become a party or successor to a party due to a







 foreclosure, deed in lieu of foreclosure or other similar exercise of a creditor's rights or remedies with respect to the related Serviced Mortgage Loan) shall not, with respect to any Administered REO Property, cause or allow the Trust to receive, any "net income from foreclosure property" that is subject to taxation under the REMIC Provisions.  Subject to the foregoing, however, the applicable Special Servicer shall have full power and authority to do any and all things in connection with the administration of any Administered REO Property, as are consistent with the Servicing Standard and, consistent therewith, shall withdraw from its REO Account, to the extent of amounts on deposit therein with respect to such Administered REO Property, funds necessary for the proper operation, management, maintenance and disposition of such Administered REO Property, including:



 (i) all insurance premiums due and payable in respect of such Administered REO Property;



 (ii) all real estate taxes and assessments in respect of such Administered REO Property that may result in the imposition of a lien thereon;



 (iii) any ground rents in respect of such Administered REO Property; and



 (iv) all other costs and expenses necessary to maintain, lease, sell, protect, manage, operate and restore such Administered REO Property.



 To the extent that amounts on deposit in the applicable Special Servicer's REO Account with respect to any Administered REO Property are insufficient for the purposes contemplated by the preceding sentence with respect to such REO Property, the applicable Master Servicer shall, at the direction of the applicable Special Servicer, but subject to Section 3.11(h), make a Servicing Advance of such amounts as are necessary for such purposes unless the applicable Master Servicer or the applicable Special Servicer determines, in its reasonable judgment, that such advances would, if made, be Nonrecoverable Servicing Advances; provided, that the applicable Master Servicer may in its sole discretion make any such Servicing Advance without regard to recoverability if it is a necessary fee or expense incurred in connection with the defense or prosecution of legal proceedings.



 (c) The applicable Special Servicer may, and, if required for the Administered REO Property to continue to qualify as "foreclosure property" within the meaning of Section 860G(a)(8) of the Code, shall, contract with any Independent Contractor for the operation and management of any Administered REO Property, provided that:



 (i) the terms and conditions of any such contract may not be inconsistent herewith and shall reflect an agreement reached at arm's length;



 (ii) the fees of such Independent Contractor (which shall be expenses of the Trust) shall be reasonable and customary in consideration of the nature and locality of such Administered REO Property;



 (iii) any such contract shall be consistent with Treasury Regulations Section 1.856-6(e)(6) and shall require, or shall be administered to require, that the Independent Contractor, in a timely manner, (A) pay all costs and expenses incurred in







 connection with the operation and management of such Administered REO Property, including those listed in Section 3.17(b) above, and (B) remit all related revenues collected (net of its fees and such costs and expenses) to the applicable Special Servicer upon receipt;



 (iv) none of the provisions of this Section 3.17(c) relating to any such contract or to actions taken through any such Independent Contractor shall be deemed to relieve the applicable Special Servicer of any of its duties and obligations hereunder with respect to the operation and management of any such Administered REO Property; and



 (v) the applicable Special Servicer shall be obligated with respect thereto to the same extent as if it alone were performing all duties and obligations in connection with the operation and management of such Administered REO Property, and the applicable Special Servicer shall comply with the Servicing Standard in maintaining such Independent Contractor.



 The applicable Special Servicer shall be entitled to enter into any agreement with any Independent Contractor performing services for it related to its duties and obligations hereunder for indemnification of the applicable Special Servicer by such Independent Contractor, and nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to limit or modify such indemnification.  To the extent the costs of any contract with any Independent Contractor for the operation and management of any Administered REO Property are greater than the revenues available from such property, such excess costs shall be covered by, and be reimbursable as, a Servicing Advance.



 (d) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the applicable Special Servicer shall not:



 (i) permit the Trust Fund to enter into, renew or extend any New Lease with respect to any Administered REO Property, if the New Lease by its terms will give rise to any income that does not constitute Rents from Real Property;



 (ii) permit any amount to be received or accrued under any New Lease other than amounts that will constitute Rents from Real Property;



 (iii) authorize or permit any construction on any Administered REO Property, other than the repair or maintenance thereof or the completion of a building or other improvement thereon, and then only if more than 10% of the construction of such building or other improvement was completed before default on the related Mortgage Loan become imminent, all within the meaning of Section 856(e)(4)(B) of the Code; or



 (iv) except as otherwise provided for in Sections 3.17(a)(i), 3.17(a)(ii) and 3.17(a)(iii) and above, Directly Operate, or allow any other Person, other than an Independent Contractor, to Directly Operate, any Administered REO Property on any date more than ninety (90) days after its date of acquisition by or on behalf of the Trust Fund;







 unless, in any such case, the applicable Special Servicer has obtained an Opinion of Counsel (the cost of which shall be paid by the applicable Master Servicer as a Servicing Advance) to the effect that such action will not cause such Administered REO Property to fail to qualify as "foreclosure property" within the meaning of Section 860G(a)(8) of the Code at any time that it is held for the benefit of the Trust Fund, in which case the applicable Special Servicer may take such actions as are specified in such Opinion of Counsel.



 (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, this Section 3.17 shall not apply to any REO Property related to a Non-Trust-Serviced Pooled Mortgage Loan.



 Section 3.18 Sale of Defaulted Mortgage Loans and Administered REO Properties; Sale of the Non-Trust-Serviced Pooled Mortgage Loans.



 (a) The applicable Master Servicer, the applicable Special Servicer or the Trustee may sell or purchase, or permit the sale or purchase of, a Mortgage Loan or Administered REO Property only (i) on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Section 3.18, (ii) as otherwise expressly provided in or contemplated by Sections 2.03 and 9.01 of this Agreement, (iii) in the case of a Mortgage Loan (or Administered REO Property related thereto) with a related mezzanine loan, in connection with a Mortgage Loan default if and as set forth in the related intercreditor agreement or (iv) in the case of a Mortgage Loan related to a Serviced Loan Combination (or REO Mortgage Loan related thereto), in connection with a Mortgage Loan default if and as set forth in the related Intercreditor Agreement.



 (b) Promptly upon a Serviced Mortgage Loan becoming a Defaulted Mortgage Loan and if the applicable Special Servicer determines in accordance with the Servicing Standard that it would be in the best interests of the Certificateholders, as a collective whole (or if such Defaulted Mortgage Loan is part of a Serviced Loan Combination, in the best interest of the Certificateholders and the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder as a collective whole), to attempt to sell such Defaulted Mortgage Loan (and if such Defaulted Mortgage Loan is part of a Serviced Loan Combination, to sell the entire Serviced Loan Combination), the applicable Special Servicer shall use reasonable efforts to solicit offers for such Defaulted Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination on behalf of the Certificateholders (or if such Defaulted Mortgage Loan is part of a Serviced Loan Combination, on behalf of the Certificateholders and the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder) in such manner as will be reasonably likely to realize a fair price; provided that, in the case of a Defaulted Mortgage Loan that is part of a Serviced Loan Combination, if the applicable Special Servicer determines to attempt to sell such Mortgage Loan it shall sell such Defaulted Mortgage Loan together with the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan as a whole loan pursuant to Section 3.18(e) and pursuant to the terms of the related Intercreditor Agreement.  The applicable Special Servicer shall accept the first (and, if multiple offers are contemporaneously received, the highest) cash offer received from any Person that constitutes a fair price for such Defaulted Mortgage Loan, subject to any applicable provisions in the related Intercreditor Agreement.  During any Subordinate Control Period or Collective Consultation Period, the applicable Special Servicer shall notify the Subordinate Class Representative of any inquiries or offers received regarding the sale of any Defaulted Mortgage Loan.  During any Collective Consultation Period or Senior Consultation Period, the applicable Special Servicer shall notify the Trust Advisor of any inquiries or offers received regarding the sale of any Defaulted Mortgage Loan.







 (c) The applicable Special Servicer shall give the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator, the applicable Master Servicer, the Trust Advisor (at any time other than a Subordinate Control Period), the Subordinate Class Representative (at any time other than during a Senior Consultation Period) and the Majority Subordinate Certificateholder (at any time other than during a Senior Consultation Period) not less than three (3) Business Days' prior written notice of its intention to sell any Defaulted Mortgage Loan.  No Interested Person shall be obligated to submit an offer to purchase any Defaulted Mortgage Loan.  In no event shall the Trustee, in its individual capacity, offer for or purchase any Defaulted Mortgage Loan.



 (d) Whether any cash offer constitutes a fair price for any Defaulted Mortgage Loan (other than a Defaulted Mortgage Loan that is part of a Serviced Loan Combination) for purposes of Section 3.17(b) of this Agreement shall be determined by the applicable Special Servicer, if the highest offeror is a Person other than an Interested Person, and by the Trustee, if the highest offeror is an Interested Person; provided, that no offer from an Interested Person shall constitute a fair price unless (i) it is the highest offer received and (ii) at least two other offers are received from independent third parties.  In determining whether any offer received from an Interested Person represents a fair price for any such Defaulted Mortgage Loan, (other than a Defaulted Mortgage Loan that is part of a Serviced Loan Combination), the Trustee shall be supplied with and shall rely on the most recent Appraisal or updated Appraisal conducted in accordance with this Agreement within the preceding nine (9) month period or, in the absence of any such Appraisal, on a new Appraisal.  The appraiser conducting any such new Appraisal shall be a Qualified Appraiser selected by the applicable Special Servicer if no Interested Person is so making an offer, with respect to a Defaulted Mortgage Loan (other than a Defaulted Mortgage Loan that is part of a Serviced Loan Combination) and selected by the Trustee if an Interested Person is so making an offer.  The cost of any such Appraisal shall be covered by, and shall be reimbursable as, a Servicing Advance.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, but subject to the proviso in the first sentence of this paragraph, in the event that an offer from an Interested Person is equal to or in excess of the Purchase Price for such Mortgage Loan, then such offer shall be deemed to be a fair price and the Trustee shall not make such determination; provided that receipt by the Trustee pursuant to the applicable notice provisions set forth in Section 12.05 of this Agreement shall be deemed receipt by a Responsible Officer of the Trustee for the purpose of this sentence.  Where any Interested Person is among those submitting offers with respect to a Defaulted Mortgage Loan, the applicable Special Servicer shall require that all offers be submitted to the Trustee in writing.  In determining whether any such offer from a Person other than an Interested Person constitutes a fair price for any such Defaulted Mortgage Loan (other than a Defaulted Mortgage Loan that is part of a Serviced Loan Combination), the applicable Special Servicer shall take into account (in addition to the results of any Appraisal, updated Appraisal or narrative appraisal that it may have obtained pursuant to this Agreement within the prior nine (9) months), and in determining whether any offer from an Interested Person constitutes a fair price for any such Defaulted Mortgage Loan (other than a Defaulted Mortgage Loan that is part of a Serviced Loan Combination), any appraiser shall be instructed to take into account, as applicable, among other factors, the period and amount of any delinquency on the affected Mortgage Loan, the occupancy level and physical condition of the related Mortgaged Property and the state of the local economy.  The Trustee may conclusively rely on the opinion of an Independent appraiser or other Independent expert in real estate matters retained by the Trustee at the expense of the Trust Fund in connection with making such determination.  The Purchase Price for any Defaulted Mortgage Loan shall in all cases be deemed a fair price (but







 subject to the proviso in the first sentence of this paragraph with respect to an offer from an Interested Person).



 Notwithstanding anything contained in the preceding paragraph to the contrary, if the Trustee is required to determine whether a cash offer by an Interested Person constitutes a fair price, the Trustee may (at its option and at the expense of the Trust Fund) designate an independent third party expert in real estate or commercial mortgage loan matters with at least 5 years' experience in valuing loans similar to the subject Mortgage Loan, that has been selected with reasonable care by the Trustee to determine if such cash offer constitutes a fair price for such Mortgage Loan.  If the Trustee designates such a third party to make such determination, the Trustee shall be entitled to rely conclusively upon such third party's determination.  The reasonable costs of all appraisals, inspection reports and broker opinions of value incurred by any such third party pursuant to this paragraph shall be covered by, and shall be reimbursable from, the offering Interested Person, and to the extent not collected from such Interested Person within 30 days of request therefor, from the Collection Account; provided that, the Trustee shall not engage a third party expert whose fees exceed a commercially reasonable amount as determined by the Trustee.



 (e) In the case of a Defaulted Mortgage Loan that is part of a Serviced Loan Combination, the applicable Special Servicer shall solicit offers for such Defaulted Mortgage Loan together with the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan as a whole loan and shall require that all offers be submitted to the Trustee in writing and otherwise meet the requirements of the related Intercreditor Agreement.  Whether any cash offer constitutes a fair price for any such Serviced Loan Combination for purposes of Section 3.17(b) of this Agreement shall be determined by the Trustee; provided, that no offer from an Interested Person (as defined in the related Intercreditor Agreement) for a Serviced Loan Combination shall constitute a fair price unless (i) it is the highest offer received and (ii) at least two other bona fide offers are received from independent third parties.  In determining whether any offer received represents a fair price for any such Serviced Loan Combination, the Trustee shall be supplied with and shall rely on the most recent Appraisal or updated Appraisal conducted in accordance with this Agreement within the preceding nine (9)-month period or, in the absence of any such Appraisal, on a new Appraisal.  The Trustee shall select the appraiser conducting any such new Appraisal.  The cost of any such Appraisal shall be covered by, and shall be reimbursable as, a Servicing Advance.  In determining whether any such offer from a Person constitutes a fair price for any such Serviced Loan Combination, the Trustee shall instruct the appraiser to take into account (in addition to the results of any Appraisal and updated Appraisal that it may have obtained pursuant to this Agreement within the prior nine (9) months), as applicable, among other factors, the period and amount of any delinquency on such Serviced Loan Combination, the occupancy level and physical condition of the related Mortgaged Property and the state of the local economy.  The Trustee may conclusively rely on the opinion of an Independent appraiser or other Independent expert in real estate matters retained by the Trustee at the expense of the Trust Fund in connection with making such determination.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the applicable Special Servicer shall not be permitted to sell the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan without the written consent of the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder unless the applicable Special Servicer has delivered to the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder:  (a) at least 15 Business Days' prior written notice of any decision to attempt to sell the related Serviced Loan Combination; (b) at least 10 days prior to the proposed sale, a copy of







 each bid package (together with any amendments to such bid packages) received by the applicable Special Servicer in connection with any such proposed sale, (c) at least 10 days prior to the proposed sale, a copy of the most recent Appraisal for such Serviced Loan Combination, and any documents in the Servicing File requested by the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder and (d) until the sale is completed, and a reasonable period of time (but no less time than is afforded to other offerors and the Subordinate Class Representative) prior to the proposed sale date, all information and other documents being provided to other offerors and all leases or other documents that are approved by the applicable Special Servicer in connection with the proposed sale; provided that the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder may waive any of the delivery or timing requirements set forth in this sentence.  Subject to the foregoing, each of the Majority Subordinate Certificateholder, the Subordinate Class Representative (during any Subordinate Control Period), the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder or a representative thereof shall be permitted to bid at any sale of the Mortgage Loan.



 Notwithstanding anything contained in the preceding paragraph to the contrary, to the extent consistent with the related Intercreditor Agreement, if the Trustee is required to determine whether a cash offer by an Interested Person constitutes a fair price, the Trustee may (at its option and at the expense of the Trust Fund) designate an independent third party expert in real estate or commercial mortgage loan matters with at least 5 years' experience in valuing loans similar to the subject mortgage loan, that has been selected with reasonable care by the Trustee to determine if such cash offer constitutes a fair price for such mortgage loan.  If the Trustee designates such a third party to make such determination, the Trustee shall be entitled to rely conclusively upon such third party's determination.  The reasonable costs of all appraisals, inspection reports and broker opinions of value incurred by any such third party pursuant to this paragraph shall be covered by, and shall be reimbursable from, the offering Interested Person, and to the extent not collected from such Interested Person within 30 days of request therefor, from the Collection Account; provided that, the Trustee shall not engage a third party expert whose fees exceed a commercially reasonable amount as determined by the Trustee.



 (f) The applicable Special Servicer shall use its reasonable efforts, consistent with the Servicing Standard, to solicit cash offers for each Administered REO Property in such manner as will be reasonably likely to realize a fair price (determined pursuant to Section 3.18(g)  below) for any Administered REO Property within a customary and normal time frame for the sale of comparable properties (and, in any event, within the time period provided for by Section 3.16(a)).  The applicable Special Servicer shall accept the first (and, if multiple cash offers are received by a specified offer date, the highest) cash offer received from any Person that constitutes a fair price (determined pursuant to Section 3.18(g) below) for such Administered REO Property.  If the applicable Special Servicer reasonably believes that it will be unable to realize a fair price (determined pursuant to Section 3.18(g) below) with respect to any Administered REO Property within the time constraints imposed by Section 3.16(a), then the applicable Special Servicer shall, consistent with the Servicing Standard, dispose of such Administered REO Property upon such terms and conditions as it shall deem necessary and desirable to maximize the recovery thereon under the circumstances.



 The applicable Special Servicer shall give the Certificate Administrator, the Trustee, the applicable Master Servicer, the Subordinate Class Representative, the Majority







 Subordinate Certificateholder not less than five (5) Business Days' prior written notice of its intention to sell any Administered REO Property pursuant to this Section 3.18(f).



 No Mortgage Loan Seller, Certificateholder or any Affiliate of any such Person shall be obligated to submit an offer to purchase any Administered REO Property, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Trustee, in its individual capacity, may not offer for or purchase any Administered REO Property pursuant hereto.



 (g) Whether any cash offer constitutes a fair price for any Administered REO Property for purposes of Section 3.18(f), shall be determined by the applicable Special Servicer or, if such cash offer is from the applicable Special Servicer or any Affiliate of the applicable Special Servicer, by the Trustee.  In determining whether any offer received from the applicable Special Servicer or an Affiliate of the applicable Special Servicer represents a fair price for any Administered REO Property, the Trustee shall be supplied with and shall be entitled to rely on the most recent Appraisal in the related Servicing File conducted in accordance with this Agreement within the preceding nine-month period (or, in the absence of any such Appraisal or if there has been a material change at the subject property since any such Appraisal, on a new Appraisal to be obtained by the applicable Special Servicer, the cost of which shall be covered by, and be reimbursable as, a Servicing Advance).  The appraiser conducting any such new Appraisal shall be a Qualified Appraiser that is (i) selected by the applicable Special Servicer if neither the applicable Special Servicer nor any Affiliate thereof is submitted an offer with respect to the subject Administered REO Property and (ii) selected by the Trustee if either the applicable Special Servicer or any Affiliate thereof is so submitting an offer.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, and subject to the last sentence of this paragraph, in the event that an offer from the applicable Special Servicer or an Affiliate thereof is equal to or in excess of the Purchase Price for such REO Property, then the Trustee shall not make any determination of fair price and such offer shall be deemed to be a fair price (provided such offer is also the highest cash offer received and at least two independent offers have been received); provided that receipt by the Trustee pursuant to the applicable notice provisions set forth in Section 12.05 of this Agreement shall be deemed receipt by a Responsible Officer of the Trustee for the purpose of this sentence.  Where any Mortgage Loan Seller, any Certificateholder or any Affiliate of any such Person is among those submitting offers with respect to any Administered REO Property, the applicable Special Servicer shall require that all offers be submitted to it (or, if the applicable Special Servicer or an Affiliate thereof is submitting an offer, be submitted to the Trustee) in writing and, if applicable, otherwise meet the requirements of the related Intercreditor Agreement.  In determining whether any offer from a Person other than any Mortgage Loan Seller, any Certificateholder or any Affiliate of any such Person constitutes a fair price for any Administered REO Property, the applicable Special Servicer (or the Trustee, if applicable) shall take into account the results of any Appraisal or updated Appraisal that it or the applicable Master Servicer may have obtained in accordance with this Agreement within the prior nine (9) months, as well as, among other factors, the occupancy level and physical condition of such Administered REO Property, the state of the then-current local economy and commercial real estate market where such Administered REO Property is located and the obligation to dispose of such Administered REO Property within a customary and normal time frame for the sale of comparable properties (and, in any event, within the time period specified in Section 3.16(a)).  The Trustee may conclusively rely on the opinion of an Independent appraiser or other Independent expert in real estate matters retained by the Trustee at the expense of the Trust Fund







 in connection with making any such determination.  The Purchase Price for any Administered REO Property (which, in connection with an Administered REO Property related to a Serviced Loan Combination, shall be construed and calculated with respect to the entire Serviced Loan Combination) shall in all cases be deemed a fair price.  Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Section 3.18, no cash offer from the applicable Special Servicer or any Affiliate thereof shall constitute a fair price for any Administered REO Property unless such offer is the highest cash offer received and at least two Independent offers (not including the offer of the applicable Special Servicer or any Affiliate) have been received.  In the event the offer of the applicable Special Servicer or any Affiliate thereof is the only offer received or is the higher of only two offers received, then additional offers shall be solicited.  If an additional offer or offers, as the case may be, are received for any Administered REO Property and the original offer of the applicable Special Servicer or any Affiliate thereof is the highest of all offers received, then the offer of the applicable Special Servicer or such Affiliate shall be accepted, provided that the Trustee has otherwise determined, as provided above in this Section 3.18(f), that such offer constitutes a fair price for the subject Administered REO Property.  Any offer by the applicable Special Servicer for any Administered REO Property shall be unconditional; and, if accepted, the subject Administered REO Property shall be transferred to the applicable Special Servicer without recourse, representation or warranty other than customary representations as to title given in connection with the sale of a real property.



 Notwithstanding anything contained in the preceding paragraph to the contrary, and, if applicable, to the extent consistent with any related Intercreditor Agreement, if the Trustee is required to determine whether a cash offer by an Interested Person constitutes a fair price, the Trustee may (at its option and at the expense of the Trust Fund) designate an independent third party expert in real estate or commercial mortgage loan matters with at least 5 years' experience in valuing loans similar to the subject mortgage loan, that has been selected with reasonable care by the Trustee to determine if such cash offer constitutes a fair price for such mortgage loan.  If the Trustee designates such a third party to make such determination, the Trustee shall be entitled to rely conclusively upon such third party's determination.  The reasonable costs of all appraisals, inspection reports and broker opinions of value incurred by any such third party pursuant to this paragraph shall be covered by, and shall be reimbursable from, the offering Interested Person, and to the extent not collected from such Interested Person within 30 days of request thereof, from the applicable Collection Account; provided that, the Trustee shall not engage a third party expert whose fees exceed a commercially reasonable amount as determined by the Trustee.



 (h) Subject to Section 3.18(a) through 3.18(g) above, the applicable Special Servicer shall act on behalf of the Trust in negotiating with Independent third parties in connection with the sale of any Defaulted Mortgage Loan or Administered REO Property and taking any other action necessary or appropriate in connection with the sale of any Defaulted Mortgage Loan or Administered REO Property, and the collection of all amounts payable in connection therewith.  In connection with the sale of any Defaulted Mortgage Loan or Administered REO Property, the applicable Special Servicer may charge prospective offerors, and may retain, fees that approximate the applicable Special Servicer's actual costs in the preparation and delivery of information pertaining to such sales or evaluating offers without obligation to deposit such amounts into the Collection Account; provided that if the applicable Special Servicer was previously reimbursed for such costs from the Collection Account, then the







 applicable Special Servicer must deposit such amounts into the Collection Account.  Any sale of a Defaulted Mortgage Loan or any Administered REO Property shall be final and without recourse to the Trustee or the Trust, and if such sale is consummated in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, neither the applicable Special Servicer nor the Trustee shall have any liability to any Certificateholder with respect to the purchase price therefor accepted by the applicable Special Servicer or the Trustee.



 (i) Any sale of any Defaulted Mortgage Loan or Administered REO Property shall be for cash only.  The applicable Special Servicer in its capacity as a Special Servicer shall have no authority to provide financing to the purchaser.



 (j) With respect to any Non-Trust-Serviced Pooled Mortgage Loan that becomes a "Defaulted Mortgage Loan" (as such term or other similar term is defined pursuant to the terms of the related Non-Trust Pooling and Servicing Agreement and construed as if such Non-Trust-Serviced Pooled Mortgage Loan were a "Mortgage Loan" under such Non-Trust Pooling and Servicing Agreement), the liquidation of such Non-Trust-Serviced Pooled Mortgage Loan shall be administered by the related Non-Trust Special Servicer in accordance with the Non-Trust Pooling and Servicing Agreement and the related Intercreditor Agreement.  Any such sale of a Non-Trust-Serviced Pooled Mortgage Loan pursuant to the related Non-Trust Pooling and Servicing Agreement and/or the related Intercreditor Agreement shall be final and without recourse to the Trustee or the Trust, and none of the applicable Master Servicer, the applicable Special Servicer or the Trustee shall have any liability to any Certificateholder with respect to the purchase price for such Non-Trust-Serviced Pooled Mortgage Loan accepted on behalf of the Trust.



 (k) If any Defaulted Mortgage Loan or REO Property is sold under this Section 3.18, or a Non-Trust-Serviced Pooled Mortgage Loan is sold in accordance with the related Intercreditor Agreement and the related Non-Trust Pooling and Servicing Agreement, then the purchase price shall be deposited into the Collection Account or, if applicable, the Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Custodial Account, and the Trustee, upon receipt of written notice from the applicable Master Servicer to the effect that such deposit has been made (based upon, in the case of a Defaulted Mortgage Loan or REO Property, notification by the applicable Special Servicer to the applicable Master Servicer of the amount of the purchase price), shall execute and deliver such instruments of transfer or assignment, in each case without recourse, as shall be provided to it and are reasonably necessary to vest ownership of such Mortgage Loan or Administered REO Property in the Person who purchased such Mortgage Loan or Administered REO Property.



 (l) Any purchaser of a Defaulted Mortgage Loan that has a related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan, whether pursuant to this Section 3.18 or pursuant to Section 2.03 or Section 9.01, will be subject to the related Intercreditor Agreement, including any requirements thereof governing who may be a holder of such Mortgage Loan.  The applicable Special Servicer will require, in connection with such a sale of such a Defaulted Mortgage Loan, that the purchaser assume in writing all of the rights and obligations of the holder of such Mortgage Loan under the related Intercreditor Agreement.







 (m) In connection with the sale of any Defaulted Mortgage Loan (other than a Non-Trust-Serviced Pooled Mortgage Loan) under the provisions described in this Section 3.18 for an amount less than the Purchase Price, the applicable Special Servicer shall obtain the approval of the Subordinate Class Representative (during any Subordinate Control Period) or consult with the Subordinate Class Representative (during any Collective Consultation Period) and the applicable Special Servicer shall consult with the Trust Advisor (during any Collective Consultation Period or Senior Consultation Period), subject to the applicable Special Servicer's prevailing duty to comply with the Servicing Standard.  In addition, in considering such a sale, the applicable Special Servicer shall consider the interests only of the Certificateholders and, in the case of a Defaulted Mortgage Loan that is part of a Serviced Loan Combination, the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder (as a collective whole, as if they together constituted a single lender).  In connection with any consultation with the Trust Advisor contemplated above in this Section 3.18(m), the applicable Special Servicer shall provide the Trust Advisor with any relevant information reasonably requested by the Trust Advisor in order to enable it to consult with the applicable Special Servicer.



 (n) Notwithstanding any of the foregoing paragraphs of this Section 3.18, the applicable Special Servicer shall not be obligated to accept the highest cash offer if such Special Servicer determines (in accordance with the Servicing Standard and, to the extent a Subordinate Control Period is then in effect, with the consent or deemed consent of the Subordinate Class Representative and, to the extent a Collective Consultation Period or a Senior Consultation Period is then in effect, in consultation with the Trust Advisor), that rejection of such offer would be in the best interests of the Certificateholders and, in the case of a Defaulted Mortgage Loan that is part of a Serviced Loan Combination, the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder (as a collective whole as if they together constituted a single lender), and such Special Servicer may accept a lower cash offer (from any Person other than itself or an Affiliate) if it determines, in its reasonable and good faith judgment, that acceptance of such offer would be in the best interests of the Certificateholders and, in the case of a Defaulted Mortgage Loan that is part of a Serviced Loan Combination, the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder(s) (as a collective whole as if they together constituted a single lender).



 Section 3.19 Additional Obligations of Master Servicers and Special Servicers.



 (a) Within sixty (60) days (or within such longer period as the applicable Special Servicer is (as certified thereby to the Trustee in writing) diligently using reasonable efforts to obtain the Appraisal referred to below) after the earliest of the date on which any Serviced Mortgage Loan (i) becomes a Modified Mortgage Loan following the occurrence of a Servicing Transfer Event, (ii) becomes an REO Mortgage Loan, (iii) with respect to which a receiver or similar official is appointed and continues for sixty (60) days in such capacity in respect of the related Mortgaged Property, (iv) the related Borrower becomes the subject of bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceedings or, if such proceedings are involuntary, such proceedings remain undismissed for sixty (60) days, (v) any Monthly Payment (other than a Balloon Payment) becomes sixty (60) days or more delinquent, or (vi) the related Borrower fails to make when due any Balloon Payment and the Borrower does not deliver to the applicable Master Servicer or the applicable Special Servicer, on or before the Due Date of the Balloon Payment, a written and fully executed (subject only to customary final closing conditions) refinancing commitment from an acceptable lender and reasonably satisfactory in form and







 substance to the applicable Master Servicer (and such Master Servicer shall  promptly forward such commitment to the applicable Special Servicer) which provides that such refinancing will occur within 120 days after the date on which the Balloon Payment will become due (provided that if either such refinancing does not occur during that time or the applicable Master Servicer is required during that time to make any P&I Advance in respect of the Mortgage Loan, an Appraisal Trigger Event will occur immediately) (each such event, an "Appraisal Trigger Event" and each such Serviced Mortgage Loan and any related REO Mortgage Loan that is the subject of an Appraisal Trigger Event, until it ceases to be such in accordance with the following paragraph, a "Required Appraisal Loan"), the applicable Special Servicer shall obtain an Appraisal of the related Mortgaged Property, unless an Appraisal thereof had previously been received (or, if applicable, conducted) within the prior nine (9) months and the applicable Special Servicer has no knowledge of changed circumstances that in the applicable Special Servicer's reasonable judgment would materially affect the value of the Mortgaged Property.  If such Appraisal is obtained from a Qualified Appraiser, the cost thereof shall be covered by, and be reimbursable as, a Servicing Advance, such Advance to be made at the direction of the applicable Special Servicer when the Appraisal is received by the applicable Special Servicer.  Promptly following the receipt of, and based upon, such Appraisal and receipt of information requested by the applicable Special Servicer from the applicable Master Servicer pursuant to the last paragraph of this Section 3.19(a), the applicable Special Servicer (in consultation with (i) the Subordinate Class Representative (during any Subordinate Control Period) or (ii) one or more of the Subordinate Class Representative and the Trust Advisor, under the procedures set forth in Section 3.28(d) and (e) (during any Collective Consultation Period or Senior Consultation Period)), shall determine and report to the Certificate Administrator, the Trustee and the applicable Master Servicer the then-applicable Appraisal Reduction Amount, if any, with respect to the subject Required Appraisal Loan.  For purposes of this Section 3.19(a), an Appraisal may, in the case of any Serviced Mortgage Loan with an aggregate outstanding principal balance of less than $2,000,000 only, consist solely of an internal valuation performed by the applicable Special Servicer.  In connection with a Mortgaged Property related to any Serviced Loan Combination, the applicable Special Servicer shall also determine and report to the Trustee, the applicable Master Servicer, the Subordinate Class Representative and the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder the Appraisal Reduction Amount, if any, with respect to the entire such Serviced Loan Combination (calculated, for purposes of this sentence, as if it were a single Mortgage Loan).



 A Serviced Mortgage Loan shall cease to be a Required Appraisal Loan if and when, following the occurrence of the most recent Appraisal Trigger Event, any and all Servicing Transfer Events with respect to such Mortgage Loan have ceased to exist and no other Appraisal Trigger Event has occurred with respect thereto during the preceding ninety (90) days.



 For so long as any Serviced Mortgage Loan or related REO Mortgage Loan remains a Required Appraisal Loan, the applicable Special Servicer shall, every nine (9) months after such Mortgage Loan becomes a Required Appraisal Loan, obtain (or, if such Required Appraisal Loan has a Stated Principal Balance of less than $2,000,000, at the applicable Special Servicer's option, conduct) an update of the prior Appraisal.  If such update is obtained from a Qualified Appraiser, the cost thereof shall be covered by, and be reimbursable as, a Servicing Advance, such Advance to be made at the direction of the applicable Special Servicer when the Appraisal is received by the applicable Special Servicer.  Promptly following the receipt of, and







 based upon, such update, the applicable Special Servicer shall redetermine, in consultation with (i) the Subordinate Class Representative (during any Subordinate Control Period) or (ii) one or more of the Subordinate Class Representative and the Trust Advisor, under the procedures set forth in Section 3.28(d) and (e) (during any Collective Consultation Period or Senior Consultation Period), and report to the Certificate Administrator, the Trustee and the applicable Master Servicer, the then-applicable Appraisal Reduction Amount, if any, with respect to the subject Required Appraisal Loan.  In connection with a Mortgaged Property related to any Serviced Loan Combination, promptly following the receipt of, and based upon, such update, the applicable Special Servicer shall also redetermine, and report to the Trustee, the applicable Master Servicer, the Subordinate Class Representative and related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder(s) the Appraisal Reduction Amount, if any, with respect to the entire such Serviced Loan Combination (calculated, for purposes of this sentence, as if it were a single Mortgage Loan).



 Notwithstanding the foregoing, but subject to the final two paragraphs of this Section 3.19(a), solely for purposes of determining whether a Subordinate Control Period is in effect (and the identity of the Subordinate Class), whenever the applicable Special Servicer is required to obtain an Appraisal or updated Appraisal under this Agreement, the Subordinate Class Representative shall have the right, exercisable within ten (10) Business Days after the applicable Special Servicer's report of the resulting Appraisal Reduction Amount, to direct the applicable Special Servicer to hire a Qualified Appraiser reasonably satisfactory to the Subordinate Class Representative to prepare a second Appraisal of the Mortgaged Property at the expense of the Subordinate Class Representative.  The applicable Special Servicer must use reasonable efforts to cause the delivery of such second Appraisal within thirty (30) days following the direction of the Subordinate Class Representative.  Within ten (10) Business Days following its receipt of such second Appraisal, the applicable Special Servicer shall determine, in accordance with the Servicing Standard, whether, based on its assessment of such second Appraisal and receipt of information requested from the applicable Master Servicer reasonably required to perform such recalculation of the Appraisal Reduction Amount, any recalculation of the Appraisal Reduction Amount is warranted and, if so, the applicable Special Servicer shall recalculate the applicable Appraisal Reduction Amount on the basis of such second Appraisal and receipt of information requested by the applicable Special Servicer from the applicable Master Servicer pursuant to the last paragraph of this Section 3.19(a).  Solely for purposes of determining whether a Subordinate Control Period is in effect and the identity of the Subordinate Class:



 (i) the first Appraisal shall be disregarded and have no force or effect, and, if an Appraisal Reduction Amount is already then in effect, the Appraisal Reduction Amount for the related Mortgage Loan shall be calculated on the basis of the most recent prior Appraisal or updated Appraisal obtained under this Agreement (or, if no such Appraisal exists, there shall be no Appraisal Reduction Amount for purposes of determining whether a Subordinate Control Period is in effect and the identity of the Subordinate Class) unless and until the (a) the Subordinate Class Representative fails to exercise its right to direct the applicable Special Servicer to obtain a second Appraisal within the exercise period described above or (b) if the Subordinate Class Representative exercises its right to direct the applicable Special Servicer to obtain a second Appraisal, such second Appraisal is not received by the applicable Special Servicer within ninety







 (90) days following such direction, whichever occurs earlier (and, in such event, an Appraisal Reduction Amount calculated on the basis of such first Appraisal, if any, shall be effective); and



 (ii) if the Subordinate Class Representative exercises its right to direct the applicable Special Servicer to obtain a second Appraisal and such second Appraisal is received by the applicable Special Servicer within ninety (90) days following such direction, the Appraisal Reduction Amount (if any), calculated by the applicable Special Servicer on the basis of the second Appraisal (if the applicable Special Servicer determines that a recalculation was warranted as described above) or (otherwise) on the basis of the first Appraisal shall be effective.



 In addition, if there is a material change with respect to any of the Mortgaged Properties related to a Serviced Mortgage Loan with respect to which an Appraisal Reduction Amount has been calculated, then (i) during any Subordinate Control Period, the Holder (or group of Holders) of Certificates representing a majority of the aggregate Voting Rights of the Classes of Principal Balance Certificates reduced by Appraisal Reduction Amounts allocated thereto to less than 25% of the initial Class Principal Balance of each such Class and (ii) during any Collective Consultation Period, the Majority Subordinate Certificateholder, shall have the right, at its sole cost and expense, to present to the applicable Special Servicer an additional Appraisal prepared by a Qualified Appraiser on an "as-is" basis and acceptable to the applicable Special Servicer in accordance with the Servicing Standard.  Subject to the applicable Special Servicer's determination, made in accordance with the Servicing Standard, that there has been a change with respect to the related Mortgaged Property and such change was material, the applicable Special Servicer shall recalculate such Appraisal Reduction Amount based upon such additional Appraisal and updated information.  If required by any such recalculation, any applicable Class of Principal Balance Certificates notionally reduced by any Appraisal Reduction Amounts allocated to such Class shall have its related Certificate Principal Balance notionally restored to the extent required by such recalculation, and there shall be a redetermination of whether a Subordinate Control Period or a Collective Consultation Period is then in effect.  With respect to each Class of Control-Eligible Certificates, the right to present the applicable Special Servicer with any such additional Appraisals as provided above is limited to no more frequently than once in any 12-month period for each Serviced Mortgage Loan with respect to which an Appraisal Reduction Amount has been calculated.



 With respect to any Appraisal Reduction Amount calculated for the purposes of determining the Majority Subordinate Certificateholder, the existence of a Subordinate Control Period, Collective Consultation Period or Senior Consultation Period and, if applicable, the allocation of Voting Rights among the respective Classes of Principal Balance Certificates, (i) the Appraised Value of the related Mortgaged Property used to calculate the Appraisal Reduction Amount shall be determined on an "as is" basis and (ii) the Appraisal Reduction Amount so calculated shall be notionally allocable between the respective Classes of Principal Balance Certificates in reverse order of their alphanumeric designations (in each case until the Certificate Principal Balance thereof is notionally reduced to zero) and the Class A-1, Class A-2, Class A-3, Class A-4, Class A-5 and Class A-SB Certificates shall be treated as a single Class in such notional allocation; provided, however, that for the purposes of such allocation, Appraisal Reduction Amounts shall be allocated to the respective Class PEX Components rather than to the







 Class PEX Certificates, and for the purposes of such allocation (A) the Class A-S Certificates and the Class A-S-PEX Component shall be considered as if they together constitute a single "Class" with an alphanumeric designation of ''A-S'', (B) the Class B Certificates and the Class B-PEX Component shall be considered as if they together constitute a single "Class" with an alphanumeric designation of ''B'', and (C) the Class C Certificates and the Class C-PEX Component shall be considered as if they together constitute as single "Class" with an alphanumeric designation of "C."



 The applicable Master Servicer shall deliver by electronic mail to the applicable Special Servicer any information in the applicable Master Servicer's possession that is reasonably required to determine, calculate, redetermine or recalculate any Appraisal Reduction Amount or updated Appraisal Reduction Amount pursuant to the definition thereof, using reasonable best efforts to deliver such information, within four (4) Business Days following the applicable Special Servicer's request therefor (which request shall be made promptly, but in no event later than ten (10) Business Days, after the applicable Special Servicer's receipt of the applicable Appraisal or the applicable internal valuation); provided, the applicable Special Servicer's failure to timely make such request shall not relieve the applicable Master Servicer of its obligation to provide such information to the applicable Special Servicer in the manner and timing set forth in this sentence.



 (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any other Section of this Agreement, the applicable Special Servicer shall notify the applicable Master Servicer whenever a Servicing Advance is required to be made with respect to any Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan or Administered REO Property, and, the applicable Master Servicer shall (subject to Section 3.11(h)) make such Servicing Advance; provided that the applicable Special Servicer shall either (i) make any Servicing Advance (other than a Nonrecoverable Servicing Advance) on a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan or Administered REO Property that constitutes an Emergency Advance or (ii) notify the applicable Master Servicer no later than one (1) Business Day after such Special Servicer acquires actual knowledge of the need for such Emergency Advance on a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan and request the applicable Master Servicer to make such Emergency Advance.  Each such notice and request shall be made, in writing, not less than five (5) Business Days or, in the case of an Emergency Advance, not later than two (2) Business Days (provided the request sets forth the nature of the emergency), in advance of the date on which the subject Servicing Advance is to be made and shall be accompanied by such information and documentation regarding the subject Servicing Advance as the applicable Master Servicer may reasonably request; provided, that the applicable Special Servicer shall not be entitled to make such a request more frequently than once per calendar month with respect to Servicing Advances other than Emergency Advances (although such request may relate to more than one Servicing Advance).  The applicable Master Servicer shall have the obligation to make any such Servicing Advance (other than a Nonrecoverable Servicing Advance) that it is so requested by the applicable Special Servicer to make (as described above) not later than the date on which the subject Servicing Advance is to be made, but in no event shall it be required to make any Servicing Advance on a date that is earlier than five (5) Business Days or, in the case of an Emergency Advance, on a date that is earlier than two (2) Business Days, following the applicable Master Servicer's receipt of such request.  If the request is timely and properly made, the requesting applicable Special Servicer shall be relieved of any obligations with respect to a Servicing Advance that it so requests the applicable Master Servicer







 to make with respect to any Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan or Administered REO Property (regardless of whether or not the applicable Master Servicer shall make such Servicing Advance).  The applicable Master Servicer shall be entitled to reimbursement for any Servicing Advance made by it at the direction of the applicable Special Servicer, together with Advance Interest in accordance with Sections 3.05(a) and 3.11(g), at the same time, in the same manner and to the same extent as the applicable Master Servicer is entitled with respect to any other Servicing Advances made thereby.  Any request by the applicable Special Servicer that the applicable Master Servicer make a Servicing Advance shall be deemed to be a determination by the applicable Special Servicer that such Servicing Advance is not a Nonrecoverable Advance, on which deemed determination the applicable Master Servicer is entitled to rely.  The preceding statement shall not be construed to limit the right of the applicable Special Servicer under Section 3.11(i) with respect to the payment of any servicing expense that, if advanced, would constitute a Nonrecoverable Servicing Advance.  If the applicable Special Servicer makes an Emergency Advance, the applicable Master Servicer shall reimburse the applicable Special Servicer for such Emergency Advance (with Advance Interest thereon at the Reimbursement Rate) within five (5) Business Days following the applicable Special Servicer's request for reimbursement (which request shall be accompanied by such information and documentation regarding the subject Emergency Advance as the applicable Master Servicer may reasonably request), upon which reimbursement the applicable Master Servicer will be deemed to have made such Emergency Advance when the applicable Special Servicer made such Emergency Advance.



 Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 3.19(b), the applicable Master Servicer shall not be required to reimburse the applicable Special Servicer for, or to make at the direction of the applicable Special Servicer, any Servicing Advance if the applicable Master Servicer determines in its reasonable judgment that such Servicing Advance, although not characterized by the applicable Special Servicer as a Nonrecoverable Servicing Advance, is in fact a Nonrecoverable Servicing Advance.  The applicable Master Servicer shall notify the applicable Special Servicer in writing of such determination and, if applicable, such Nonrecoverable Servicing Advance shall be reimbursed to the applicable Special Servicer pursuant to Section 3.05(a).



 (c) Each Master Servicer shall deliver to the Certificate Administrator for deposit in the Distribution Account by 1:00 pxxPDmxxPD (New York City time) on the Master Servicer Remittance Date, without any right of reimbursement therefor, a cash payment (a "Compensating Interest Payment") in an amount equal to the lesser of (i) the aggregate amount of Prepayment Interest Shortfalls incurred in connection with voluntary Principal Prepayments received in respect of the Serviced Mortgage Loans for which it is acting as Master Servicer (other than Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans and Serviced Mortgage Loans on which the applicable Special Servicer allowed or consented to the applicable Master Servicer allowing a Principal Prepayment on a date other than the applicable Due Date) during the related Collection Period, and (ii) the aggregate of (A) that portion of its Master Servicing Fees earned by such Master Servicer for the related Distribution Date that is, in the case of each and every Serviced Mortgage Loan and REO Mortgage Loan for which such Master Servicing Fees are being paid in the related Collection Period, calculated for this purpose at one (1) basis point (0.01%) per annum, and (B) all Prepayment Interest Excesses received by the applicable Master Servicer during the related Collection Period; provided that the applicable Master Servicer shall pay







 (without regard to clause (ii) above) the amount of any Prepayment Interest Shortfall otherwise described in clause (i) above incurred in connection with any Principal Prepayment received in respect of a Serviced Mortgage Loan during the related Collection Period to the extent such Prepayment Interest Shortfall occurs as a result of the applicable Master Servicer allowing the related Borrower to deviate from the terms of the related Mortgage Loan Documents regarding Principal Prepayments (other than (w) subsequent to a default under the related Mortgage Loan Documents, (x) pursuant to applicable law or a court order (including in connection with amounts collected as Insurance Proceeds or Condemnation Proceeds to the extent that such applicable law or court order limits the ability of the applicable Master Servicer to apply the proceeds in accordance with the related Mortgage Loan Documents), (y)  at the request or with the consent of the applicable Special Servicer, or (z) during any Subordinate Control Period or Collective Consultation Period, at the request or with the consent of the Subordinate Class Representative). No Master Servicer shall be obligated to make any compensating interest payments as a result of any prepayments on Mortgage Loans for which it does not act as Master Servicer.



 The rights of the Certificateholders to offsets of any Prepayment Interest Shortfalls shall not be cumulative from Collection Period to Collection Period.



 (d) With respect to each Serviced Mortgage Loan that is to be defeased in accordance with its terms, the applicable Master Servicer shall execute and deliver to each Rating Agency (subject to Section 3.27) a certification substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit N and, further, shall, to the extent permitted by the terms of such Mortgage Loan, require the related Borrower (i) to provide replacement collateral consisting of UxxPDSxxPD government securities within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act in an amount sufficient to make all scheduled payments under the subject Serviced Mortgage Loan (or defeased portion thereof) when due (and assuming, in the case of an ARD Mortgage Loan, to the extent consistent with the related Mortgage Loan Documents, that the subject ARD Mortgage Loan matures on its Anticipated Repayment Date), (ii) to deliver a certificate from an independent certified public accounting firm certifying that the replacement collateral is sufficient to make such payments, (iii) at the option of the applicable Master Servicer, to designate a single-purpose entity (which may be (but is not required to be) a subsidiary of the applicable Master Servicer established for the purpose of assuming all defeased Serviced Mortgage Loans) to assume the subject Serviced Mortgage Loan (or defeased portion thereof) and own the defeasance collateral, (iv) to implement such defeasance only after the second anniversary of the Closing Date, (v) to provide an Opinion of Counsel that the Trustee has a perfected, first priority security interest in the new collateral, and (vi) in the case of a partial defeasance of the subject Serviced Mortgage Loan, to defease a principal amount equal to at least 125% of the allocated loan amount for the Mortgaged Property or Properties to be released; provided that, if (A) the subject Serviced Mortgage Loan has a Cut-off Date Principal Balance greater than or equal to $35,000,000 or an outstanding principal balance greater than or equal to 2% of the aggregate Stated Principal Balance of the Mortgage Pool or is one of the ten largest Mortgage Loans then in the Trust Fund, (B) the terms of the subject Serviced Mortgage Loan do not permit the applicable Master Servicer to impose the foregoing requirements and the applicable Master Servicer does not satisfy such requirements on its own or (C) the applicable Master Servicer is unable to execute and deliver the certification attached hereto as Exhibit N in connection with the subject defeasance, then the applicable Master Servicer shall so notify the







 Rating Agencies (subject to Section 3.27), the Subordinate Class Representative and the Majority Subordinate Certificateholder and, if any Mortgage Loan in a Serviced Loan Combination is involved, the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder(s) and, so long as such a requirement would not violate applicable law or the Servicing Standard, obtain a Rating Agency Confirmation (subject to Section 3.27) with respect to such defeasance.  Subject to the related Mortgage Loan Documents and applicable law, the applicable Master Servicer shall not permit a defeasance unless (i) the subject Serviced Mortgage Loan requires the Borrower to pay (or the Borrower in fact pays) all Rating Agency fees associated with defeasance (if a Rating Agency Confirmation is a specific condition precedent thereto) and all expenses associated with defeasance or other arrangements for payment of such costs are made at no expense to the Trust Fund or the applicable Master Servicer (provided, that in no event shall such proposed other arrangements result in any liability to the Trust Fund including any indemnification of the applicable Master Servicer or the applicable Special Servicer which may result in legal expenses to the Trust Fund), and (ii) the Borrower is required to provide all Opinions of Counsel, including Opinions of Counsel that the defeasance will not cause an Adverse REMIC Event or an Adverse Grantor Trust Event and that the related Mortgage Loan Documents are fully enforceable in accordance with their terms (subject to bankruptcy, insolvency and similar standard exceptions), and any applicable Rating Agency Confirmations.



 (e) In connection with the Serviced Mortgage Loans or Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan for which the related Borrower was required to escrow funds or post a Letter of Credit related to obtaining performance objectives, such as targeted debt service coverage levels or leasing criteria with respect to the Mortgaged Property as a whole or particular portions thereof, if the mortgagee has the discretion to retain the cash or Letter of Credit (or the proceeds of such Letters of Credit) as additional collateral if the relevant conditions to release are not satisfied, then the applicable Master Servicer shall hold such escrows or Letters of Credit (or the proceeds of such Letters of Credit) as additional collateral and not use such funds to reduce the principal balance of the related Mortgage Loan or Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan (to the extent the related Mortgage Loan Documents allow such action), unless holding such funds would otherwise be inconsistent with the Servicing Standard.



 Section 3.20 Modifications, Waivers, Amendments and Consents.



 (a) The applicable Special Servicer (in the case of a Serviced Mortgage Loan or Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan that is a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan and in the case of a Special Servicer Decision or a Material Action with respect to a Performing Mortgage Loan or related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan) or the applicable Master Servicer (in the case of a Performing Serviced Mortgage Loan or Performing Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan other than a Special Servicer Decision or a Material Action with respect to a Performing Mortgage Loan or related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan) may (consistent with the Servicing Standard) agree to any modification, waiver or amendment of any term of, extend the maturity of, defer or forgive interest (including Default Interest) on and principal of, defer or forgive late payment charges, Prepayment Premiums and Yield Maintenance Charges on, permit the release, addition or substitution of collateral securing, and/or permit the release, addition or substitution of the Borrower on or any guarantor of, any Serviced Mortgage Loan for which it is responsible, and respond to or approve Borrower requests for consent on the part of the mortgagee (including the lease reviews and lease consents related thereto), subject, however, to

 Loan or Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan that would affect the amount or timing of any related payment of principal, interest or other amount payable thereunder or, in the reasonable judgment of the applicable Special Servicer, would materially impair the security for such Mortgage Loan, unless a material default on such Mortgage Loan has occurred or, in the reasonable judgment of the applicable Special Servicer, a default with respect to payment on such Mortgage Loan or Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan at maturity or on an earlier date is reasonably foreseeable, or the applicable Special Servicer reasonably believes that there is a significant risk of such a default, and, in either case, such modification, waiver, amendment or other action is reasonably likely to produce an equal or a greater recovery to Certificateholders (and, in the case of a Serviced Loan Combination, the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder(s)), as a collective whole, on a present value basis (the relevant discounting of anticipated collections that will be distributable to Certificateholders (and, in the case of a Serviced Loan Combination, the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder(s)) to be done at a rate determined by the applicable Special Servicer but in no event less than the related Net Mortgage Rate (or, in the case of an ARD Mortgage Loan after its Anticipated Repayment Date, at the related Net Mortgage Rate immediately prior to the Anticipated Repayment Date), than would liquidation; provided that (A) any modification, extension, waiver or amendment of the payment terms of the related Serviced Loan Combination shall be structured in a manner so as to be consistent with the allocation and payment priorities set forth in the related Mortgage Loan Documents, including the related Intercreditor Agreement, it being the intention that neither the Trust as holder of the related Mortgage Loan nor any Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder shall gain a priority over any other with respect to any payment, which priority is not, as of the date of the related Intercreditor Agreement, reflected in the related Mortgage Loan Documents, including the related Intercreditor Agreement; and (B) to the extent consistent with the Servicing Standard, no waiver, reduction or deferral of any particular amounts due on the related Mortgage Loan shall be effected prior to the waiver, reduction or deferral of the entire corresponding item in respect of the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan;



 (iii) neither the applicable Master Servicer nor the applicable Special Servicer shall extend the date on which any Balloon Payment is scheduled to be due on any Mortgage Loan to a date beyond the earlier of (A) five years prior to the Rated Final Distribution Date and (B) if such Mortgage Loan is secured by a Mortgage solely or primarily on the related Borrower's leasehold interest in the related Mortgaged Property, 20 years (or, to the extent consistent with the Servicing Standard, giving due consideration to the remaining term of the related Ground Lease or Space Lease, ten years) prior to the end of the then-current term of the related Ground Lease or Space Lease (plus any unilateral options to extend);



 (iv) neither the applicable Master Servicer nor the applicable Special Servicer shall make or permit any modification, waiver or amendment of any term of, or take any of the other acts referenced in this Section 3.20(a) with respect to, any Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination that would result in an Adverse REMIC Event with respect to any REMIC Pool or an Adverse Grantor Trust Event with respect with to the Grantor Trust Pool (the applicable Master Servicer and the applicable Special Servicer shall not







 be liable for decisions made under this subsection which were made in good faith and each of them may rely on Opinions of Counsel in making such decisions);

Proc. 2010-30, 2010-36 IxxPDRxxPDBxxPD 316 (the applicable Master Servicer and the applicable Special Servicer may each rely on Opinions of Counsel in making such decisions, the costs of which shall be covered by, and reimbursable as, Servicing Advances) and (B) in connection with (i) the release of any portion of a Mortgaged Property from the lien of the related Mortgage (other than in connection with a defeasance) or (ii) the taking of any portion of a Mortgaged Property by exercise of the power of eminent domain or condemnation, if the Mortgage Loan Documents require the applicable Master Servicer or Special Servicer, as applicable, to calculate (or approve the calculation by the related Borrower of) the loan-to-value ratio of the remaining Mortgaged Property or Mortgaged Properties or the fair market value of the real property constituting the remaining Mortgaged Property or Mortgaged Properties, for purposes of REMIC qualification of the related Mortgage Loan, then such calculation of the value of collateral will be solely based on the real property included therein and exclude personal property and going concern value, if any, unless otherwise permitted under the applicable REMIC rules as evidenced by an Opinion of Counsel provided to the Trustee;

 Upon receiving a request for any matter described in this Section 3.20(a) that constitutes a Special Servicer Decision or a Material Action (without regard to the proviso in the definition of "Special Servicer Decision" or "Material Action," as applicable) with respect to a Performing Serviced Mortgage Loan or a Performing Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan, the applicable Master Servicer shall forward such request to the applicable Special Servicer and, unless the applicable Master Servicer and the applicable Special Servicer mutually agree that the







 applicable Master Servicer shall process such request, the applicable Special Servicer shall process such request and the applicable Master Servicer shall have no further obligation with respect to such request or such Special Servicer Decision or Material Action.



 (b) If any payment of interest on a Serviced Mortgage Loan is deferred pursuant to Section 3.20(a), then such payment of interest shall not, for purposes of calculating monthly distributions and reporting information to Certificateholders, be added to the unpaid principal balance or Stated Principal Balance of the related Mortgage Loan, notwithstanding that the terms of such Mortgage Loan so permit or that such interest may actually be capitalized; provided, that this sentence shall not limit the rights of the applicable Master Servicer or the applicable Special Servicer on behalf of the Trust to enforce any obligations of the related Borrower under such Mortgage Loan.



 (c) Each of  the applicable Master Servicer and the applicable Special Servicer may, as a condition to its granting any request by a Borrower under a Serviced Mortgage Loan or Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan for consent, modification, waiver or indulgence or any other matter or thing, the granting of which is within the applicable Master Servicer's or the applicable Special Servicer's, as the case may be, discretion pursuant to the terms of the related Mortgage Loan Documents and is permitted by the terms of this Agreement, require that such Borrower pay to it a reasonable or customary fee for the additional services performed in connection with such request, together with any related costs and expenses incurred by it; provided that (A) the charging of such fees would not otherwise constitute a "significant modification" of the subject Mortgage Loan or Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section 1.860G-2(b); and (B) the right of the applicable Special Servicer shall be limited as set forth in the definition of "Modification Fees."

 described in clauses (i)-(x) above, (A) would not constitute a "significant modification" of the subject Serviced Mortgage Loan pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section 1.860G-2(b), would not cause any Serviced Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination to cease to be treated as "principally secured by real property" and would not otherwise constitute an Adverse REMIC Event with respect to REMIC I, REMIC II or REMIC III or constitute an Adverse Grantor Trust Event with respect to the Grantor Trust Pool, and (B) would be consistent with the Servicing Standard.



 (g) If and to the extent that the Trust, as holder of a Non-Trust-Serviced Pooled Mortgage Loan, is entitled to consent to or approve any modification, waiver or amendment of such Non-Trust-Serviced Pooled Mortgage Loan, the applicable Master Servicer, if it shall receive any such request, shall, in accordance with the immediately following sentence, either (i) forward such request to the applicable Special Servicer for a response or (ii) respond to any request for such consent or approval.  The applicable Master Servicer or the applicable Special Servicer, as the case may be, shall respond to any such request in accordance with the Servicing Standard, and subject to Section 3.01(g), subject to the same conditions and/or restrictions, as if such Non-Trust-Serviced Pooled Mortgage Loan was a Performing Serviced Mortgage Loan and such request was received under this Agreement.  Insofar as any other Person would have consent rights hereunder with respect to a similar modification, waiver or amendment of a Mortgage Loan that is a Performing Serviced Mortgage Loan, such Person shall likewise have the same consent rights, subject to the same conditions and/or restrictions, with respect to such modification, waiver or amendment of such Non-Trust-Serviced Pooled Mortgage Loan.

 (i) In connection with (i) the release of any portion of a Mortgaged Property from the lien of the related Serviced Mortgage Loan or (ii) the taking of any portion of a Mortgaged Property securing a Serviced Mortgage Loan by exercise of the power of eminent domain or condemnation, if the Mortgage Loan Documents require the applicable Master Servicer or the applicable Special Servicer, as applicable, to calculate (or to approve the calculation of the related Borrower of) the loan-to-value ratio of the remaining Mortgaged Property or the fair market value of the real property constituting the remaining Mortgaged Property, for purposes of REMIC qualification of the related Serviced Mortgage Loan, then such calculation shall include only the value of the real property constituting the remaining Mortgaged Property.

 (e) Subject to the provisions of the following sentence, none of the General Special Servicer, the Trust Advisor or any of their respective Affiliates shall contact the related Borrower or any key principal of such Borrower about any Serviced Mortgage Loan without the prior consent of the applicable Master Servicer, unless (i) the related Borrower has initiated such contact, (ii) with respect to the General Special Servicer, such Serviced Mortgage Loan (A) is a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan or (B) is a Performing Mortgage Loan and such contact relates to a Special Servicer Decision or Material Action, or (iii) with respect to the Trust Advisor, such Serviced Mortgage Loan is a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan and such contact relates to the Trust Advisor's satisfaction of its obligations under this Agreement in the Trust Advisor's reasonable judgment; provided, that the General Special Servicer or its Affiliates may conduct promotions which are directed generally to commercial mortgage loan borrowers, originators and mortgage brokers, including, without limitation, mass mailings based upon commercially acquired mailing lists or information generally available in the public domain, newspaper, radio, television or print advertisements, or take actions in connection with servicing the refinancing needs of a Borrower who, without such direct or indirect solicitation by the General Special Servicer, contacts the General Special Servicer with the purpose of refinancing such Serviced Mortgage Loan.

 (e) Each of the applicable Master Servicer and the applicable Special Servicer, for the benefit of the Trustee and the Certificateholders (and, in the case of a Sub-Servicing Agreement related to a Serviced Loan Combination, for the benefit of the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder(s)), shall (at no expense to any other party hereto or to the Certificateholders or the Trust) monitor the performance and enforce the obligations of their respective Sub-Servicers under the related Sub-Servicing Agreements.  Such enforcement, including the legal prosecution of claims, termination of Sub-Servicing Agreements in accordance with their respective terms and the pursuit of other appropriate remedies, shall be in such form and carried out to such an extent and at such time as the applicable Master Servicer or Special Servicer, as applicable, in its reasonable judgment, would require were it the owner of the subject Mortgage Loans.

 (g) Notwithstanding any Sub-Servicing Agreement entered into by the applicable Master Servicer or the applicable Special Servicer, as the case may be, the applicable Master Servicer and the applicable Special Servicer shall each remain obligated and liable to the Trustee and the Certificateholders (and, in the case of a Serviced Loan Combination, the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder(s)) for the performance of their respective obligations and duties under this Agreement in accordance with the provisions hereof to the same extent and under the same terms and conditions as if it alone were servicing and administering the Mortgage Loans and/or REO Properties for which it is responsible.  The applicable Master Servicer and the applicable Special Servicer shall each pay the fees of any Sub-Servicer retained by it in accordance with the respective Sub-Servicing Agreement and, in any event, from its own funds (or from funds otherwise then payable to it hereunder).



 (h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, any account established and maintained by a Sub-Servicer pursuant to a Sub-Servicing Agreement with the applicable Master Servicer shall for all purposes under this Agreement be deemed to be an account established and maintained by the applicable Master Servicer.



 (i) Notwithstanding any contrary provisions of the foregoing subsections of this Section 3.22, the appointment by the applicable Master Servicer or the applicable Special Servicer of one or more third-party contractors for the purpose of performing discrete, ministerial







 functions shall not constitute the appointment of Sub-Servicers and shall not be subject to the provisions of this Section 3.22; provided, that (a) the applicable Master Servicer or the applicable Special Servicer, as the case may be, shall remain responsible for the actions of such third-party contractors as if it were alone performing such functions and shall pay all fees and expenses of such third-party contractors; (b) such appointment imposes no additional duty on any other party to this Agreement, any successor hereunder to the applicable Master Servicer or the applicable Special Servicer, as the case may be, or on the Trust; and (c) the subject contractor (if it would be a Servicing Function Participant) is not a Prohibited Party at the time of such appointment unless (in the case of this clause (c)) the appointment of such contractor has been expressly approved by the Depositor acting in its reasonable discretion.  The proviso to the preceding sentence shall not be construed to limit the right of the applicable Master Servicer or the applicable Special Servicer to be reimbursed for any cost or expense for which it is otherwise entitled to reimbursement under this Agreement.



 (j) The applicable Special Servicer shall not enter into any Sub-Servicing Agreement unless the Subordinate Class Representative has consented thereto (during any Subordinate Control Period) or such Sub-Servicing Agreement is required to be entered into in connection with a Serviced Loan Combination pursuant to the exercise by the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder of its rights under Section 7.01(b) of this Agreement, and the execution and delivery of such Sub-Servicing Agreement is the subject of a Rating Agency Confirmation.



 (k) Notwithstanding any other provision set forth in this Agreement to the contrary, immediately upon the effectiveness of any resignation or termination of the applicable Master Servicer under this Agreement or any other transaction in which a Person becomes the applicable Master Servicer hereunder, the successor Master Servicer (including, without limitation, the Trustee if it assumes the servicing obligations of the applicable Master Servicer) shall be deemed to automatically have assumed and agreed to the terms and provisions of each Designated Sub-Servicing Agreement without any further action.  No Designated Sub-Servicing Agreement shall be deemed to be inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement solely as a result of its recognition of the provisions, or its inclusion of provisions to the effect, set forth in the preceding sentence.  If a task, right or obligation of the applicable Master Servicer is delegated to a Designated Sub-Servicer under a Designated Sub-Servicing Agreement, and such task, right or obligation involves or requires the consent of the applicable Special Servicer, then the applicable Special Servicer shall accept the performance of such task, right or obligation by the Designated Sub-Servicer only in accordance with the terms of this Agreement (including without limitation any time periods for consent or deemed consent to be observed by the applicable Special Servicer) as if the applicable Master Servicer were performing it.  Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement, each of the parties hereto acknowledges and agrees that the applicable Special Servicer is neither a party to any Designated Sub-Servicing Agreement, nor is it bound by any provision of any Designated Sub-Servicing Agreement.  The applicable Special Servicer hereby acknowledges the delegation of rights and duties hereunder by the applicable Master Servicer pursuant to the provisions of each Designated Sub-Servicing Agreement.  Nothing in this Section 3.22(k) shall affect the applicable Master Servicer's obligations under this Section 3.22 to monitor the performance and enforce the obligations of a Designated Sub-Servicer under the related Designated Sub-Servicing Agreement, imposes any additional liability on the applicable Special Servicer for the actions or inactions of a Designated Sub-Servicer or imposes on the







 applicable Special Servicer any obligation to monitor the performance and enforce the obligations of the Designated Sub-Servicer under the related Designated Sub-Servicing Agreement.  Each Designated Sub-Servicer shall be a third-party beneficiary of this subsection (k).  In no event shall this subsection (k) be construed to impose liability on the Trust Fund or the applicable Special Servicer for the failure of the applicable Master Servicer, or any successor Master Servicer, to perform its duties under any Designated Sub-Servicing Agreement.

 (c) Within ten (10) Business Days of any appointment or replacement of a Subordinate Class Representative (other than the initial Subordinate Class Representative), the Certificate Administrator shall deliver to each of the Trustee, the Master Servicers, the Special Servicers and the Trust Advisor notice of the identity of such Subordinate Class Representative, including the name and address furnished to the Certificate Administrator under subsection (a).  The Certificate Administrator shall also deliver such information to each Master Servicer or each Special Servicer promptly upon request therefor by such Master Servicer or such Special Servicer, as the case may be.  With respect to such information, the Certificate Administrator shall be entitled to conclusively rely on information provided to it under subsection (a), and the Master Servicers and the Special Servicers shall all be entitled to rely on such information provided by the Certificate Administrator with respect to any obligation or right hereunder that the Master Servicers or the Special Servicers, as the case may be, may have to deliver information or otherwise communicate with the Subordinate Class Representative.  In addition to the foregoing, within two (2) Business Days of its receipt of notice of the resignation or removal of a Subordinate Class Representative, the Certificate Administrator shall notify the other parties to this Agreement of such event.



 (d) A Subordinate Class Representative may at any time resign as such by giving written notice to the Majority Subordinate Certificateholder, which shall thereupon give







 written notice to the Certificate Administrator, the Trustee, the Special Servicers and the Master Servicers.  The effectiveness of such resignation shall not be conditioned upon or subject to the prior appointment or approval of a successor to the resigning Subordinate Class Representative.  In no event shall the failure of the Subordinate Class Representative or the Majority Subordinate Certificateholder to provide such notice prejudice or call into question the effectiveness of such resignation.  The preceding statement shall not be construed to limit the effect of subsection (e).



 (e) Once a Subordinate Class Representative has been selected pursuant to this Section 3.23, each of the parties to this Agreement shall be entitled to rely on such selection unless the Majority Subordinate Certificateholder or such Subordinate Class Representative, as applicable, shall have notified the Certificate Administrator and each other party to this Agreement, in writing, of the resignation or removal of such Subordinate Class Representative.



 (f) Any and all expenses of the Subordinate Class Representative shall be borne by the Holders (or, if applicable, the Certificate Owners) of Certificates of the Subordinate Class, pro rata according to their respective Percentage Interests in such Class, and not by the Trust.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a claim is made against the Subordinate Class Representative by a Borrower with respect to this Agreement or any particular Mortgage Loan, the Subordinate Class Representative shall immediately notify the Certificate Administrator, the Trustee, the Master Servicers and the Special Servicers, whereupon (if a Special Servicer, a Master Servicer, the Certificate Administrator, the Trustee or the Trust are also named parties to the same action and, in the sole judgment of the Co-op Special Servicer, if such claim arises out of or relates solely to an NCB, FSB Mortgage Loan, or the General Special Servicer, in the case of all other claims, (i) the Subordinate Class Representative had acted in good faith, without negligence or willful misfeasance, with regard to the particular matter at issue, and (ii) there is no potential for either Special Servicer, either Master Servicer, the Certificate Administrator, the Trustee or the Trust to be an adverse party in such action as regards the Subordinate Class Representative) the Co-op Special Servicer, if such claim arises out of or relates solely to an NCB, FSB Mortgage Loan, or the General Special Servicer, in the case of all other claims, on behalf of the Trust shall, subject to Section 6.03 and the consent of the Subordinate Class Representative, assume, at the expense of the Trust Fund, the defense of any such claim against the Subordinate Class Representative; provided, that no judgment against the Subordinate Class Representative shall be payable out of the Trust Fund.  This provision shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the termination or resignation of any Subordinate Class Representative.



 (g) The Subordinate Class Representative may receive amounts payable to the applicable Special Servicer as special servicing compensation as described in and to the extent as such Special Servicer and the Subordinate Class Representative may agree.



 (h) In addition, upon request of a Master Servicer, a Special Servicer or the Trust Advisor, as applicable, the Certificate Administrator shall reasonably promptly provide the name of the then-current Majority Subordinate Certificateholder and, if requested, a list of the Certificateholders (or a securities position listing from the Depository) of the Majority Subordinate Certificateholder to such requesting party (at the expense of the Trust Fund).







 (i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, during such time as the Class E Certificates are the Subordinate Class, the Majority Subordinate Certificateholder may waive its rights to appoint a Subordinate Class Representative and to exercise any of the rights of the Majority Subordinate Certificateholder or to cause the exercise of the rights of the Subordinate Class Representative as set forth in this Agreement by irrevocable written notice delivered to the Depositor, Certificate Administrator, Trustee, each Master Servicer, each Special Servicer and Trust Advisor (any such Holder or group of affiliated Holders that makes such an election, the "Opting-Out Party").  Any such waiver shall remain effective with respect to such Holder and such Class until such time as the Opting-Out Party has sold or transferred a majority of the Class E Certificates to an unaffiliated third party (such sale or transfer, a "Class E Transfer").  Following any such Transfer the successor Majority Subordinate Certificateholder shall again have the rights of the Majority Subordinate Certificateholder as set forth herein (including the rights to appoint a Subordinate Class Representative or cause the exercise of the rights of the Subordinate Class Representative) without regard to any prior waiver by the predecessor Majority Subordinate Certificateholder.  The successor Majority Subordinate Certificateholder shall also have the right as provided in this Section 3.23(i) to irrevocably waive its rights to appoint a Subordinate Class Representative and to exercise any of the rights of the Majority Subordinate Certificateholder or to cause the exercise of the rights of the Subordinate Class Representative as set forth in this Agreement.  No successor Majority Subordinate Certificateholder described above shall have any consent rights with respect to any Mortgage Loan that became a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan prior to the Transfer and had not also become a Corrected Mortgage Loan prior to such Transfer until such time as such Mortgage Loan becomes a Corrected Mortgage Loan.



 (j) The Subordinate Class Representative may not be a Borrower or an Affiliate of a Borrower.



 Section 3.24 Asset Status Reports and Certain Rights and Powers of the Subordinate Class Representative.



 (a) No later than forty-five (45) days after a Servicing Transfer Event for a Serviced Mortgage Loan, the applicable Special Servicer shall deliver in electronic format a report (the "Asset Status Report") with respect to such Serviced Mortgage Loan and the related Mortgaged Property to the applicable Master Servicer, the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator, the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder (if any) (only to the extent such Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder is expressly entitled to receive such Asset Status Report under the related Intercreditor Agreement and the subject of the Asset Status Report does not involve a sale or proposed sale of the Mortgage Loan), the Subordinate Class Representative and the Majority Subordinate Certificateholder (during any Subordinate Control Period or Collective Consultation Period), the Trust Advisor (during any Collective Consultation Period or Senior Consultation Period) and the Rule 17g-5 Information Provider (who shall promptly post such report on the Rule 17g-5 Information Provider's Website in accordance with Section 8.12(b)).  Such Asset Status Report shall set forth the following information to the extent reasonably determinable:



 (i) a summary of the status of such Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan and any negotiations with the related Borrower;







 (ii) a discussion of the general legal and environmental considerations reasonably known to the applicable Special Servicer (including without limitation by reason of any Phase I Environmental Assessment and any additional environmental testing contemplated by Section 3.09(c)), consistent with the Servicing Standard, that are applicable to the exercise of remedies set forth herein and to the enforcement of any related guaranties or other collateral for such Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan and whether outside legal counsel has been retained;



 (iii) the most current rent roll (or, with respect to Co-op Mortgage Loans, maintenance schedule) and income or operating statement available for the related Mortgaged Property or Mortgaged Properties;



 (iv) a summary of the applicable Special Servicer's recommended action with respect to such Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan;



 (v) the Appraised Value of the related Mortgaged Property or Mortgaged Properties, together with the assumptions used in the calculation thereof (which the applicable Special Servicer may satisfy by providing a copy of the most recently obtained Appraisal); and



 (vi) such other information as the applicable Special Servicer deems relevant in light of the Servicing Standard.



 During a Subordinate Control Period, if the Subordinate Class Representative does not disapprove an Asset Status Report within ten (10) Business Days (or, with respect to a Serviced Loan Combination, such longer period of time as may be set forth in the related Intercreditor Agreement) of receipt, the applicable Special Servicer shall implement the recommended action as outlined in the Asset Status Report.  In addition, during a Subordinate Control Period, the Subordinate Class Representative may object to any Asset Status Report within ten (10) Business Days of receipt (or, with respect to a Serviced Loan Combination, such longer period of time as may be set forth in the related Intercreditor Agreement); provided, that the applicable Special Servicer shall implement the recommended action as outlined in the Asset Status Report if it makes a determination in accordance with the Servicing Standard that the objection is not in the best interest of all the Certificateholders (as a collective whole, as if they together constituted a single lender).  If, during a Subordinate Control Period, the Subordinate Class Representative disapproves the Asset Status Report and the applicable Special Servicer has not made the affirmative determination described above, the applicable Special Servicer shall revise the Asset Status Report and deliver a new Asset Status Report as soon as practicable, but in no event later than thirty (30) days after the disapproval, to the applicable Master Servicer, the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator, the Majority Subordinate Certificateholder, the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder (if any) (only to the extent such Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder is expressly entitled to receive such Asset Status Report under the related Intercreditor Agreement and the subject of the Asset Status Report does not involve a sale or proposed sale of the Mortgage Loan) and the Rule 17g-5 Information Provider (who shall promptly post such revised Asset Status Report on the Rule 17g-5 Information Provider's Website in accordance with Section 8.12(c)).  During a Subordinate Control Period, the applicable Special Servicer shall revise the Asset Status Report until the Subordinate







 Class Representative fails to disapprove the revised Asset Status Report as described above, until the Subordinate Class Representative's approval is no longer required or until the applicable Special Servicer makes a determination that the objection is not in the best interests of all the Certificateholders (as a collective whole, as if they together constituted a single lender).  If, during a Subordinate Control Period, the Subordinate Class Representative and the applicable Special Servicer have not agreed upon an Asset Status Report within ninety (90) days following the Subordinate Class Representative's receipt of the initial Asset Status Report, the applicable Special Servicer shall implement the actions described in the most recent Asset Status Report submitted by the applicable Special Servicer to the Subordinate Class Representative.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the applicable Special Servicer determines that emergency action is necessary to protect the related Mortgaged Property or the interests of the Certificateholders, or if a failure to take any such action at such time would be inconsistent with the Servicing Standard, the applicable Special Servicer may take actions with respect to the related Mortgaged Property before the expiration of the ten (10) Business Day period (or, with respect to a Serviced Loan Combination, such longer period of time as may be set forth in the related Intercreditor Agreement) referenced above and if the applicable Special Servicer reasonably determines in accordance with the Servicing Standard that failure to take such actions before the expiration of such period would materially and adversely affect the interest of the Certificateholders and the applicable Special Servicer has made commercially reasonable efforts, during a Subordinate Control Period, to contact the Subordinate Class Representative.  The foregoing shall not relieve the applicable Special Servicer of its duties to comply with the Servicing Standard.



 The applicable Special Servicer may, from time to time, modify any Asset Status Report it has previously delivered and implement such report, provided such report shall have been prepared, reviewed and not rejected pursuant to the terms of this Section 3.24(a).



 In addition, the applicable Special Servicer shall deliver a summary (as approved by the Subordinate Class Representative if a Subordinate Control Period is in effect) of each Final Asset Status Report to the Certificate Administrator, the Majority Subordinate Certificateholder and the Trust Advisor (and, with respect to the Trust Advisor, shall also deliver each Final Asset Status Report).  Upon receipt of such summary, the Certificate Administrator shall post such summary on its website in accordance with Section 8.12(b).



 A "Final Asset Status Report," with respect to any Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan, means each related Asset Status Report, together with such other data or supporting information provided by the applicable Special Servicer to the Subordinate Class Representative, in each case prepared in connection with the workout or liquidation of such Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan and which, in any event, will not include any Privileged Information; provided, that no Asset Status Report shall be considered to be a Final Asset Status Report unless, during a Subordinate Control Period, the Subordinate Class Representative has either finally approved of and consented to the actions proposed to be taken in connection therewith, or has exhausted all of its rights of approval or consent, or has been deemed to approve or consent to such action.



 Each of the Subordinate Class Representative (during any Collective Consultation Period) and the Trust Advisor (during any Collective Consultation Period and any Senior Consultation Period) will be entitled to consult on a non-binding basis with the applicable







 Special Servicer and propose possible alternative courses of action and provide other feedback in respect of any Asset Status Report, and the applicable Special Servicer shall consider such alternative courses of action and any other feedback provided by the Subordinate Class Representative and/or the Trust Advisor, as applicable.  The applicable Special Servicer may revise the Asset Status Reports as it deems reasonably necessary in accordance with the Servicing Standard to take into account any input and/or recommendations of the Subordinate Class Representative and/or the Trust Advisor.  Consultation with the Trust Advisor shall occur in the manner provided in Section 3.28(f) and (h).



 During any Senior Consultation Period, the Trust Advisor will be entitled to consult on a non-binding basis with the applicable Special Servicer and propose possible alternative courses of action and provide other feedback in respect of any Asset Status Report, and the applicable Special Servicer shall consider such alternative courses of action and any other feedback provided by the Trust Advisor.  The applicable Special Servicer may revise the Asset Status Reports as it deems reasonably necessary in accordance with the Servicing Standard to take into account any input and/or recommendations of the Trust Advisor.  The interaction with the Trust Advisor shall occur in the manner provided in Section 3.28(f) and (h).



 (b) Upon receiving notice of the occurrence of the events described in clause (c) of the definition of Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan (without regard to the sixty (60)-day or one hundred twenty (120)-day period, respectively, set forth therein), the applicable Master Servicer shall with reasonable promptness give notice thereof, and shall use its reasonable efforts to provide the applicable Special Servicer with all information relating to the Serviced Mortgage Loan and reasonably requested by the applicable Special Servicer.  The applicable Master Servicer shall use its reasonable efforts to comply with the preceding sentence within five (5) Business Days of the occurrence of each such event.



 (c) During any Subordinate Control Period, (i) the Subordinate Class Representative will be entitled to approve or disapprove Asset Status Reports and (ii) the applicable Special Servicer generally will not be permitted to take or consent to the applicable Master Servicer's taking any Material Action not otherwise covered by an approved Asset Status Report, unless and until the applicable Special Servicer has notified the Subordinate Class Representative and the Subordinate Class Representative has consented (or failed to object) thereto in writing within ten (10) Business Days (or, in connection with a leasing matter, five (5) Business Days, or in connection with an Acceptable Insurance Default, thirty (30) days) of having been notified thereof in writing and provided with all reasonably requested information by it (or, in the case of a proposed action for which the applicable Master Servicer has requested approval from the applicable Special Servicer, within any shorter period during which the applicable Special Servicer is initially entitled to withhold consent without being deemed to have approved the action as identified in writing by the applicable Master Servicer to the applicable Special Servicer when making such request).  However, the applicable Special Servicer may take any Material Action (or consent to the applicable Master Servicer's taking a Material Action) without waiting for the response of the Subordinate Class Representative if the applicable Special Servicer determines that immediate action is necessary to protect the interests of the Certificateholders and, if affected thereby, the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder(s), as a collective whole.  Furthermore, during a Subordinate Control Period, the Subordinate Class Representative may, in general, direct the applicable Special Servicer to take,







 or to refrain from taking, any actions as that representative may deem advisable with respect to the servicing and administration of Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans and REO Properties or as to which provision is otherwise made in this Agreement.  During a Subordinate Control Period, the Majority Subordinate Certificateholder, or the Subordinate Class Representative on its behalf shall have the right to remove the existing applicable Special Servicer, with or without cause, and appoint a successor to the applicable Special Servicer, all as provided in Section 6.05(a).



 During any Collective Consultation Period, the Subordinate Class Representative shall have consultation rights (in addition to those of the Trust Advisor) with respect to Material Actions not otherwise covered by an Asset Status Report as to which the Subordinate Class Representative shall have been consulted.  During any Collective Consultation Period or Senior Consultation Period, the Majority Subordinate Certificateholder and the Subordinate Class Representative shall have no right to remove the existing applicable Special Servicer.



 During any Collective Consultation Period or Senior Consultation Period, the applicable Special Servicer shall consult on a non-binding basis with the Trust Advisor with respect to Material Actions (regardless of whether such Material Action is covered by an Asset Status Report); provided, that the applicable Special Servicer shall not consult with the Trust Advisor with respect to Material Actions related to collateral substitutions, assignments, insurance policies, borrower substitutions, lease modifications and amendments and other similar actions that the applicable Special Servicer may perform under this Agreement to the extent such actions do not relate to the restructuring, resolution, sale or liquidation of a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan or REO Property.



 For the purposes of this Agreement, "Material Action" means, for any Serviced Mortgage Loan and any related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan, any of the following actions:



 (i) any proposed or actual foreclosure upon or comparable conversion (which shall include acquisitions of any REO Property) of the ownership of the property or properties securing any Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan that comes into and continues in default;



 (ii) any modification, consent to a modification or waiver of any monetary term (other than late fees and Default Interest) or material non-monetary term (including, without limitation, the timing of payments and acceptance of discounted payoffs) of a Serviced Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination or any extension of the maturity date of a Serviced Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination;



 (iii) following a default or an event of default with respect to a Serviced Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination, any exercise of remedies, including the acceleration of the Serviced Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination or initiation of any proceedings, judicial or otherwise, under the related Mortgage Loan Documents;



 (iv) any sale of a Defaulted Mortgage Loan or REO Property for less than the applicable Purchase Price;

 (vi) any release of material collateral or any acceptance of substitute or additional collateral for a Serviced Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination or any consent to either of the foregoing, other than if required pursuant to the specific terms of the related Mortgage Loan Documents and for which there is no lender discretion;



 (vii) any waiver of a "due-on-sale" or "due-on-encumbrance" clause with respect to a Serviced Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination or any consent to such a waiver or consent to a transfer of a Mortgaged Property or interests in the borrower (other than any waiver of a "due-on-encumbrance" clause pertaining to a Co-op Mortgage Loan with respect to subordinate financing as to which the NCB, FSB Subordinate Debt Conditions have been satisfied);



 (viii) any incurrence of additional debt by a borrower or any mezzanine financing by any beneficial owner of a borrower (to the extent that the lender has consent rights pursuant to the related Mortgage Loan Documents (for purposes of the determination whether a lender has such consent rights pursuant to the related Mortgage Loan Documents, any Mortgage Loan Document provision that requires that an intercreditor agreement be reasonably or otherwise acceptable to the lender shall constitute such consent rights)), other than, with respect to a Co-op Mortgage Loan, subordinate debt as to which the NCB, FSB Subordinate Debt Conditions have been satisfied;



 (ix) any material modification, waiver or amendment of an intercreditor agreement, co-lender agreement or similar agreement with any mezzanine lender or subordinate debt holder related to a Serviced Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination, or any action to enforce rights (or decision not to enforce rights) with respect thereto, or any material modification, waiver or amendment thereof;



 (x) any property management company changes (with respect to a Serviced Mortgage Loan with a principal balance greater than $2,500,000 and other than with respect to a Co-op Mortgage Loan), including, without limitation, approval of the termination of a manager and appointment of a new property manager, or franchise changes (with respect to a Serviced Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination for which the lender is required to consent or approve such changes under the Mortgage Loan Documents);



 (xi) releases of any material amounts from any escrow accounts, Reserve Funds or Letters of Credit, in each case, held as performance escrows or reserves (other than with respect to residential cooperative properties), other than those required pursuant to the specific terms of the related Mortgage Loan Documents and for which there is no lender discretion (and other than those that are permitted to be undertaken by a Master Servicer without the consent of a Special Servicer pursuant to Section 3.20(f));







 (xii) any acceptance of an assumption agreement or any other agreement permitting a transfer of interests in a borrower, guarantor or other obligor releasing a borrower, guarantor or other obligor from liability under a Serviced Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination other than pursuant to the specific terms of such Serviced Mortgage Loan and for which there is no lender discretion;



 (xiii) any determination of an Acceptable Insurance Default;



 (xiv) any determination by the applicable Master Servicer to transfer a Serviced Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination to the applicable Special Servicer under the circumstances described in paragraph (c) of the definition of "Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan"; or



 (xv) any modification, waiver or amendment of any lease, the execution of any new lease or the granting of a subordination and nondisturbance or attornment agreement in connection with any lease, at a Mortgaged Property if (a) the lease involves a ground lease or lease of an outparcel or affects an area greater than or equal to the lesser of (1) 30% of the net rentable area of the improvements at the Mortgaged Property and (2) 30,000 square feet of the improvements at the Mortgaged Property and (b) such transaction either is not described by clause (iv) of Section 3.20(f) or such transaction relates to a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan;



 provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing, solely with respect to determining whether the applicable Master Servicer or the applicable Special Servicer will process any of the matters listed in the foregoing clauses (i) through (xv), "Material Action" shall not include any matter listed in the foregoing clauses (i) through (xv) with respect to a Mortgage Loan if the applicable Master Servicer and the applicable Special Servicer have mutually agreed, as contemplated by Section 3.08(a) or Section 3.20(a), as applicable, of this Agreement, that the applicable Master Servicer will process such matter with respect to such Mortgage Loan.

 Section 3.25 Application of Default Charges.



 (a) Any and all Default Charges that are actually received by or on behalf of the Trust with respect to any Serviced Mortgage Loan (other than any Mortgage Loan included in a Serviced Loan Combination) or any related REO Mortgage Loan that is a successor thereto (net of any portion thereof applied to pay Advance Interest under Section 3.05) and (to the extent remitted to the applicable Master Servicer by the related Non-Trust Master Servicer and, in any event, subject to the related Intercreditor Agreement) any and all Default Charges that are actually received by or on behalf of the Trust with respect to a Non-Trust-Serviced Pooled Mortgage Loan or successor REO Mortgage Loan during any Collection Period shall be applied for the following purposes and in the following order, in each case to the extent of the remaining portion of such charges and fees:

 (ii) second, to reimburse the Trust Fund for any Advance Interest paid to the Trustee, the applicable Master Servicer or the applicable Special Servicer following the Closing Date with respect to such Mortgage Loan or REO Mortgage Loan, as the case may be, which interest was paid from a source other than Default Charges collected on such Mortgage Loan or REO Mortgage Loan, as the case may be; and



 (iii) third, with respect to any remaining Default Charges ("Net Default Charges"), to the applicable Master Servicer, to the extent that such Net Default Charges accrued while the related Mortgage Loan was not a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan, or to the applicable Special Servicer, to the extent that such Net Default Charges accrued while the related Mortgage Loan was a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan.

 to the extent such information is provided in writing to the applicable Master Servicer by the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder.  Upon the transfer of any Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan, each subsequent Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder has agreed to inform the applicable Master Servicer of its name and address and of any transfer thereof by delivering a copy of an assignment and assumption agreement pursuant to the related Intercreditor Agreement.

Upon receipt of a written request from any party hereto, the applicable Master Servicer shall provide a current list of Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder(s), together with contact information for the Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder(s).



 In no event shall the applicable Master Servicer be obligated to pay any party the amounts payable to a Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder hereunder other than the Person listed as such Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder on the Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder Register.  If a Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder transfers the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan without notice to the applicable Master Servicer, the applicable Master Servicer shall have no liability whatsoever for any misdirected payment on such Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan and shall have no obligation to recover and redirect such payment.



 The applicable Master Servicer shall promptly provide the names and addresses of any Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder(s) to any party hereto, and any such party or successor may, without further investigation, conclusively rely upon such information.

 (c) With respect to any Serviced Loan Combination during any Subordinate Control Period, the Subordinate Class Representative shall be entitled to exercise the consent rights of such Serviced Loan Combination to the extent set forth in the applicable Intercreditor Agreement, in accordance with the terms of the related Intercreditor Agreement and this Agreement.



 (d) The applicable Special Servicer (if any Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan is a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan or has become an REO Mortgage Loan) or the applicable Master Servicer (with respect to any Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan that is not a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan), as applicable, shall take all actions relating to the servicing and/or administration of, and the preparation and delivery of reports and other information with respect to, the Serviced Loan Combination related to any Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan or any related REO Property required to be performed by the holder of the related Mortgage Loan or contemplated to be performed by a servicer, in any case pursuant to and as required by the related Intercreditor Agreement.  In addition notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the following considerations shall apply with respect to the servicing of a Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan:

 (ii) the applicable Master Servicer and the applicable Special Servicer shall each consult with and obtain the consent of the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder(s) to the extent required by the related Intercreditor Agreement.



 If any Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan or any portion thereof or any particular payments thereon are included in a REMIC or a "grantor trust" (within the meaning of the Grantor Trust Provisions), then neither the applicable Master Servicer nor the applicable Special Servicer shall knowingly take any action that would result in the equivalent of an Adverse REMIC Event with respect to such REMIC or adversely affect the tax status of such grantor trust as a grantor trust.



 The parties hereto acknowledge that no Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder shall (1) owe any fiduciary duty to the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator, the applicable Master Servicer, the applicable Special Servicer or any Certificateholder or (2) have any liability to the Trustee or the Certificateholders for taking any action, or for refraining from the taking of any action, pursuant to the related Intercreditor Agreement, or for the giving of any consent or for errors in judgment.  Each Certificateholder, by its acceptance of a Certificate, shall be deemed to have confirmed its understanding that a Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder (i) may take or refrain from taking actions that favor its interests or the interests of its affiliates over the Certificateholders, (ii) may have special relationships and interests that conflict with the interests of the Certificateholders and shall be deemed to have agreed to take no action against any Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder or any of its officers, directors, employees, principals or agents as a result of such special relationships or conflicts, and (iii) shall not be liable by reason of its having acted or refrained from acting solely in its interest or in the interest of its affiliates.



 The parties hereto recognize and acknowledge the rights of each Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder under the related Intercreditor Agreement.



 Each of the rights of any Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder under or contemplated by this Section 3.26(d) may be exercisable by a designee thereof on its behalf; provided that the applicable Master Servicer, the applicable Special Servicer, the Certificate Administrator and the Trustee are provided with written notice by such Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder of such designation (upon which such party may conclusively rely) and the contact details of the designee.



 If any Person purchases the related Mortgage Loan as a Defaulted Mortgage Loan pursuant to Section 3.18, then (subject to the related Intercreditor Agreement) the Person effecting the purchase must also pay and/or reimburse to the parties hereto the respective amounts then currently due and owing to them hereunder with respect to the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan(s) that, pursuant to this Agreement, would not otherwise have been payable out of the applicable purchase price and/or any other amounts payable in connection with such purchase (or if payable out of such purchase price and/or other amounts, remain







 unpaid after such application) and that, pursuant to the related Intercreditor Agreement, would otherwise have been payable out of future collections on such Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan.  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any such purchase shall be subject to such reimbursements.



 Any reference to servicing any of the Mortgage Loans in accordance with any of the related Mortgage Loan Documents (including the related Mortgage Note and Mortgage) shall also mean, in the case of a Serviced Loan Combination, in accordance with the related Intercreditor Agreement.



 For purposes of exercising any rights that the holder of the Mortgage Note for any Mortgage Loan in a Serviced Loan Combination may have under the related Intercreditor Agreement, the Subordinate Class Representative shall be the designee of the Trust, as such noteholder, and the Trustee shall take such actions as may be necessary under the related Intercreditor Agreement to effect such designation.



 (e) With respect to each Serviced Loan Combination, the applicable Master Servicer or the applicable Special Servicer, as applicable, shall provide such Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder and, if applicable, any related "Non-Controlling Note Holder" under the related Intercreditor Agreement (or its designee or representative) to the extent required hereunder to be provided to Certificateholders or to the Subordinate Class Representative, within the same time frame it is required to provide such information and materials to the Certificateholders or the Subordinate Class Representative, as applicable, hereunder (1) with copies of each financial statement received by the applicable Master Servicer pursuant to the terms of the related Mortgage Loan Documents, (2) with copies of any notice of default sent to the Borrower and (3) subject to the terms of the related Mortgage Loan Documents, copies of any other documents relating to such Serviced Loan Combination, including, without limitation, property inspection reports, loan servicing statements, Borrower requests, asset status reports, any other information delivered by the applicable Master Servicer to the Subordinate Class Representative and copies of any other notice, information or report that it is required to provide to the Subordinate Class Representative pursuant to this Agreement with respect to any "major decisions" or the implementation of any recommended actions outlined in an Asset Status Report relating to such Serviced Loan Combination.  Any copies to be furnished by the applicable Master Servicer or the applicable Special Servicer may be furnished by hard copy or electronic means.



 (f) With respect to each Serviced Loan Combination, the applicable Master Servicer or the applicable Special Servicer, as applicable, shall:



 (i) consult with the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder (or its designee or representative) on a strictly non-binding basis, to the extent that such Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder (or its designee or representative) requests consultation with respect to any "major decision" set forth in the related Intercreditor Agreement or the implementation of any recommended actions outlined in an Asset Status Report relating to a Serviced Loan Combination, and to consider alternative actions recommended by such Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder (or its designee or representative); provided that after the expiration of a period of ten







 (10) Business Days from the delivery to the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder (or its designee or representative) of written notice of a proposed action, together with copies of the related notice, information or report, the applicable Master Servicer or the applicable Special Servicer, as applicable, shall no longer be obligated to consult with the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder (or its designee or representative) (unless the applicable Master Servicer or the applicable Special Servicer, as applicable, proposes a new course of action that is materially different from the action previously proposed, in which case such ten (10) Business Day period shall begin anew from the date of such proposal and delivery of all information relating thereto).  Notwithstanding the foregoing non-binding consultation rights of the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder, the applicable Master Servicer or the applicable Special Servicer, as applicable, may take any "major decision" set forth in the related Intercreditor Agreement or any action set forth in the Asset Status Report before the expiration of the aforementioned or extended ten (10) Business Day period if the applicable Master Servicer or the applicable Special Servicer, as applicable, determines that immediate action with respect thereto is necessary to protect the interests of the Certificateholders and the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder.  In no event shall the applicable Master Servicer or the applicable Special Servicer be obligated at any time to follow or take any alternative actions recommended by any Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder; and



 (ii) in addition to the foregoing non-binding consultation rights, each Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder shall have the right to annual meetings with the applicable Master Servicer or the applicable Special Servicer at the offices of the applicable Master Servicer or the applicable Special Servicer, as applicable, upon reasonable notice and at times reasonably acceptable to the applicable Master Servicer or the applicable Special Servicer, as applicable, in which servicing issues related to the related Serviced Loan Combination are discussed.

 received the response to the initial request described in clause (II) above, then (x) with respect to any condition in any Mortgage Loan Document requiring such Rating Agency Confirmation or any other matter under this Agreement relating to the servicing of the Mortgage Loans (other than as set forth in clause (y) or clause (z) below), the Requesting Party (or, if the Requesting Party is the related Borrower, then the applicable Master Servicer (with respect to matters it is processing) or the applicable Special Servicer (with respect to matters it is processing) shall determine (with the consent of the Subordinate Class Representative, during any Subordinate Control Period, which consent shall be deemed given if the Subordinate Class Representative does not respond within five (5) Business Days of receipt of a request to consent to the Requesting Party's determination), in accordance with its duties under this Agreement and in accordance with the Servicing Standard, except as provided in Section 3.27(b), whether or not to waive such condition for such particular action at such time, (y) with respect to a replacement or succession of the applicable Master Servicer or the applicable Special Servicer, such condition shall be deemed to be satisfied if the applicable replacement (1) is rated at least "CMS3" (in the case of the applicable Master Servicer) or "CSS3" (in the case of the applicable Special Servicer), if Fitch is the non-responding Rating Agency; (2) KBRA has not cited servicing concerns of the applicable replacement Master Servicer or the applicable replacement Special Servicer as the sole or material factor in any qualification, downgrade or withdrawal of the ratings (or placement on "watch status" in contemplation of a ratings downgrade or withdrawal) of securities in a transaction serviced by the applicable servicer prior to the time of determination, if KBRA is the non-responding Rating Agency; or (3) is currently acting as master servicer or special servicer, as applicable, on a "deal-level" or "transaction-level" basis for all of the mortgage loans in other commercial mortgage-backed securities transactions and Moody's has not cited servicing concerns of the applicable replacement Master Servicer or the applicable replacement Special Servicer as the sole or material factor in any qualification, downgrade or withdrawal of the ratings (or placement on "watch status" in contemplation of a ratings downgrade or withdrawal) of securities in any other commercial mortgage-backed securitization transaction serviced by the applicable servicer prior to the time of determination, if Moody's is the non-responding Rating Agency, and (z) with respect to a replacement or succession of the Trust Advisor, such condition shall be deemed to be waived with respect to any non-responding Rating Agency so long as such Rating Agency shall not have cited concerns regarding the replacement trust advisor as the sole or material factor in any qualification, downgrade or withdrawal of the ratings (or placement on "watch status" in contemplation of a ratings downgrade or withdrawal) of securities in a transaction with respect to which the replacement trust advisor acts as trust advisor or operating advisor prior to the time of determination.  The applicable Requesting Party's communications to confirm a Rating Agency's receipt of information, and such Requesting Party's additional request for the related Rating Agency Confirmation under clause (i) of the preceding sentence shall not itself be subject to the advance posting and delayed delivery requirements of Section 3.27(g), but this statement shall not be construed to relieve the applicable Requesting Party of compliance with Section 3.27(g) to the extent that such communications or such additional request to a Rating Agency include or are accompanied by any information regarding the underlying request for the related Rating Agency Confirmation that was not delivered in the original request for such Rating Agency Confirmation.



 (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 3.27, for purposes of the provisions of any Mortgage Loan Document or this Agreement relating to defeasance







 (including without limitation the type of collateral acceptable for use as defeasance collateral) or release or substitution of any collateral, any Rating Agency Confirmation requirement in the Mortgage Loan Documents for which the applicable Master Servicer or the applicable Special Servicer would have been permitted to waive obtaining such Rating Agency Confirmation pursuant to Section 3.27(a)(ii)(x) shall be deemed to have been satisfied.

 Section 3.28 The Trust Advisor.



 (a) (i)  Within sixty (60) days after the end of each calendar year during any Senior Consultation Period, the Trust Advisor shall meet with representatives of each Special Servicer if such Special Servicer prepared (and delivered to the Trust Advisor) an Asset Status Report with respect to a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan or REO Property during such calendar year to perform such review of each such Special Servicer's operational practices on a platform-level basis in light of the Servicing Standard and the requirements of this Agreement and shall discuss such Special Servicer's stated policies and procedures, operational controls and protocols, risk management systems, technological infrastructure (systems), intellectual resources, such Special Servicer's reasoning for believing it is in compliance with this Agreement and other pertinent information the Trust Advisor may consider relevant, in each case, insofar as such information relates to the workout, restructuring, resolution, sale or liquidation of Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans by such Special Servicer during such calendar year.



 (ii) Based on (a) the Trust Advisor's review of, (1) during any Subordinate Control Period, any previously identified Final Asset Status Reports delivered to the Trust Advisor by the applicable Special Servicer, and (2) during any Collective Consultation Period or Senior Consultation Period, any Asset Status Reports and other information delivered to the Trust Advisor by the applicable Special Servicer (other than any communications between the Subordinate Class Representative and that Special Servicer that would be Privileged Information) and (b) during a Senior Consultation Period, the Trust Advisor's meeting with the applicable Special Servicer, the Trust Advisor shall deliver to the Trustee and to the Certificate Administrator (who shall promptly post such Trust Advisor Annual Report on the Certificate Administrator's Website in accordance with Section 8.12(b)) and the Rule 17g-5 Information Provider (who shall promptly post such Trust Advisor Annual Report on the Rule 17g-5 Information Provider's Website in accordance with Section 8.12(b)) within 120 days of the end of the prior calendar year an annual report (the "Trust Advisor Annual Report"), substantially in the form of Exhibit O-1 or Exhibit O-2, as applicable (which form may be modified or altered as to either its organization or content by the Trust Advisor, subject to compliance of such form with the terms and provisions of this Agreement including, without limitation, provisions herein relating to Privileged Information; provided, that in no event shall the information or any other content included in the Trust Advisor Annual Report contravene any provision of this Agreement) setting forth the Trust Advisor's assessment of the applicable Special Servicer's performance of its duties under this







 Agreement during the prior calendar year on a platform-level basis with respect to the workout, restructuring, resolution, sale and liquidation of Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans during the prior calendar year; provided, that during any Subordinate Control Period, such assessment shall relate solely to Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans with respect to which a Final Asset Status Report has been issued.  If the Trust Advisor has provided for review to the applicable Special Servicer a Trust Advisor Annual Report containing an assessment of the performance of such Special Servicer pursuant to Section 3.28(a)(iv) that in the reasonable view of such Special Servicer presents a negative assessment of that Special Servicer's performance, that Special Servicer shall be permitted to provide to the Trust Advisor non-privileged information and documentation, in each case that is reasonably relevant to the facts upon which the Trust Advisor has based such assessment, and the Trust Advisor shall undertake a reasonable review of such additional limited non-privileged information and documentation prior to finalizing its annual assessment.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the content of the Trust Advisor's Annual Report shall be determined solely by the Trust Advisor.  Subject to the restrictions and limitations in this Agreement, including, without limitation, Section 3.28(b), (c), (d) and (g) hereof, each Trust Advisor Annual Report shall (A) identify any material deviations of which it has actual knowledge (i) from that Special Servicer's obligations to comply with the Servicing Standard and (ii) from that Special Servicer's obligations under this Agreement with respect to the workout, restructuring, resolution, sale or liquidation of Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans and (B) comply with all of the confidentiality requirements described in this Agreement regarding Privileged Information (subject to any permitted exceptions).

Each Trust Advisor Annual Report shall be delivered to the Certificate Administrator, and the Certificate Administrator shall promptly upon receipt post such Trust Advisor Annual Report on the Certificate Administrator's Website in accordance with Section 8.12(b).  The Trust Advisor shall also deliver a copy of each Trust Advisor Annual Report to the applicable Master Servicer, the applicable Special Servicer and, during any Subordinate Control Period or Collective Consultation Period, the Subordinate Class Representative and the Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder(s).

 (iii) The Trust Advisor, the Trust Advisor's subcontractors and the Trust Advisor's Affiliates shall keep, and the Trust Advisor shall cause the Trust Advisor's subcontractors and the Trust Advisor's Affiliates to keep, confidential any Privileged Information received from the applicable Special Servicer or Subordinate Class Representative in connection with the Subordinate Class Representative's exercise of any rights under this Agreement (including, without limitation, in connection with any Asset Status Report) or otherwise in connection with the Certificates.  Subject to the permitted exceptions in the following sentence, the Trust Advisor shall not disclose such

 (iv) During any Senior Consultation Period, the Trust Advisor shall provide the applicable Special Servicer with at least thirty (30) days' prior written notice of the date proposed for the annual meeting described in this Section 3.28(a).  The Trust Advisor and the applicable Special Servicer shall determine a mutually acceptable date for the annual meeting and the Trust Advisor shall deliver, at least fourteen (14) days prior to such annual meeting, a proposed written agenda to the applicable Special Servicer, including the identity of the Final Asset Status Report(s), if any, that shall be discussed during the annual meeting.

The applicable Special Servicer shall make available Servicing Officers with relevant knowledge regarding the applicable Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans and the related platform  level information for each annual meeting described in this Section 3.28.



 (v) If the Trust Advisor's ability to perform its obligations in respect of the Trust Advisor Annual Report is limited or prohibited due to the failure of a party hereto to timely deliver information required to be delivered to the Trust Advisor or such







 information is inaccurate or incomplete, the Trust Advisor shall set forth such limitations or prohibitions in the related Trust Advisor Annual Report.



 (b) During a Subordinate Control Period, the Trust Advisor's obligations shall be limited to the general reviews as set forth in this Agreement and generally will not involve an assessment of specific actions of the applicable Special Servicer and, in any event, shall be subject to limitations described in this Agreement.



 (c) The Trust Advisor shall not be required, in connection with any Trust Advisor Annual Report during a Subordinate Control Period, to consider any Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan or REO Property with respect to which a Final Asset Status Report was not issued during the most recently ended calendar year.



 (d) During any Subordinate Control Period, the applicable Special Servicer shall forward any Appraisal Reduction Amount calculations and net present value calculations used in the applicable Special Servicer's determination of what course of action to take in connection with the resolution or liquidation of a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan to the Trust Advisor (and, during any Collective Consultation Period, the Subordinate Class Representative) after they have been finalized, and the Trust Advisor may review such calculations in support of its Trust Advisor Annual Report but shall not opine on, or otherwise call into question (whether in the annual report or otherwise) such Appraisal Reduction Amount calculations and/or net present value calculations.



 (e) During any Collective Consultation Period or Senior Consultation Period, the applicable Special Servicer shall forward any calculations of Appraisal Reduction Amount or net present value to the Trust Advisor and, during any Collective Consultation Period, the Subordinate Class Representative, and (a) the Trust Advisor shall (upon receipt of all information and supporting materials reasonably required to be provided to the Trust Advisor as described in the following sentence) promptly recalculate and verify the accuracy of the mathematical calculations and the corresponding application of the applicable formulas required to be utilized in connection with any Appraisal Reduction Amount or net present value calculations used in the applicable Special Servicer's determination of what course of action to take in connection with the resolution or liquidation of a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan prior to the utilization by the applicable Special Servicer, and (b) insofar as the calculation and/or application of the applicable Special Servicer under review as contemplated by clause (a) requires or depends upon the exercise of discretion by the applicable Special Servicer, the Trust Advisor shall assess the reasonableness of the determination made by the applicable Special Servicer in the exercise of such discretion.  The applicable Special Servicer shall deliver the foregoing calculations, together with information and supporting materials (including such additional information reasonably requested by the Trust Advisor to confirm the mathematical accuracy of such calculations, but not including any Privileged Information) to the Trust Advisor and (during any Collective Consultation Period) the Subordinate Class Representative.  In the event the Trust Advisor does not agree with (i) the mathematical calculations, (ii) the application of the applicable non-discretionary portions of the formula required to be utilized for such calculation or (iii) the reasonableness of any such determination made by the applicable Special Servicer in the exercise of such discretion, the Trust Advisor and the applicable Special Servicer shall consult in good faith with each other in order to resolve (x) any inaccuracy in the







 mathematical calculations or the application of the non-discretionary portions of the related formula in arriving at those mathematical calculations or (y) any disagreement over the reasonableness of a determination made by the applicable Special Servicer in the exercise of its discretion.  During any Collective Consultation Period, the applicable Special Servicer shall also send to the Subordinate Class Representative copies of the applicable Special Servicer's calculations and such information and supporting materials, as provided above to the Trust Advisor under this subsection, and engage in consultation with the Subordinate Class Representative in connection with such calculations and determinations.  During any Collective Consultation Period, if the Trust Advisor and the Subordinate Class Representative agree on such matters, the applicable Special Servicer shall perform its calculations in accordance with such agreement.  Otherwise, if the Trust Advisor and the Subordinate Class Representative do not reach agreement on such matters following the Trust Advisor's calculation and verification procedures, the applicable Special Servicer shall proceed according to its determination, and the Trust Advisor shall promptly prepare a report on the matter, which report shall set forth its and the applicable Special Servicer's calculations (including any material differences in assumptions used therein), and deliver such report to the Certificate Administrator, which shall post the report to the Certificate Administrator's Website in accordance with Section 8.12(b) and, if applicable, to the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder.  No other action is required in connection with such circumstances.



 (f) During any Collective Consultation Period or Senior Consultation Period, the applicable Special Servicer shall promptly deliver each Asset Status Report prepared in connection with the workout, restructuring, resolution, sale or liquidation of a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan to the Trust Advisor and, during a Collective Consultation Period, the Subordinate Class Representative.  The Trust Advisor shall provide comments to the applicable Special Servicer in respect of each Asset Status Report within ten (10) Business Days of receipt of both such Asset Status Report and any additional information reasonably requested by the Trust Advisor, and propose possible alternative courses of action to the extent it determines such alternatives may be in the best interest of the Certificateholders (including any Certificateholders of the Control-Eligible Classes) and the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder (if applicable), as a collective whole.  Regardless of whether the applicable Special Servicer receives comments from the Trust Advisor by the end of such ten (10) Business Day period, such Special Servicer may (after the expiration of such period) proceed to perform such actions as in accordance with such Asset Status Report.



 (g) During any Collective Consultation Period (in addition to the Subordinate Class Representative) or Senior Consultation Period, the Trust Advisor shall consult on a non-binding basis with the applicable Special Servicer with respect to, and prior to, Material Actions (regardless of whether such Material Action is covered by an Asset Status Report) and the Trust Advisor shall provide comments to such Special Servicer in respect of each such Material Action within ten (10) Business Days of receipt of both a written request for consultation with respect to such Material Action and any additional information reasonably requested by the Trust Advisor; provided, that the Trust Advisor shall have no such duty with respect to collateral substitutions, assignments, insurance policies, borrower substitutions, lease modifications and amendments and other similar actions that the applicable Special Servicer may perform under this Agreement to the extent such actions do not relate to the workout, restructuring, resolution, sale or liquidation of a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan or REO







 Property.  Regardless of whether the applicable Special Servicer receives comments from the Trust Advisor by the end of such ten (10) Business Day period, such Special Servicer may (after the expiration of such period) proceed to perform such Material Actions as in accordance with such request for consultation.



 (h) The applicable Special Servicer shall consider such written alternative courses of action and any other feedback provided by the Trust Advisor and, during any Collective Consultation Period, the Subordinate Class Representative.  The applicable Special Servicer shall revise each such Asset Status Report as it deems necessary to take into account such input and/or comments, to the extent the applicable Special Servicer determines that the Trust Advisor's and/or Subordinate Class Representative's input and/or recommendations are consistent with the Servicing Standard and in the best interest of the Certificateholders, taking into account the interests of all of the Certificateholders (including any Certificateholders of the Control-Eligible Classes) (and the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder, as applicable), as a collective whole.



 (i) The applicable Special Servicer shall not be required to take or to refrain from taking any action because of an objection or comment by the Trust Advisor or a recommendation of the Trust Advisor that would require or cause the applicable Special Servicer to violate applicable law, the terms of any Mortgage Loan, any Serviced Loan Combination or any other provision of this Agreement, including the applicable Special Servicer's obligation to act in accordance with the Servicing Standard and the REMIC Provisions or result in an Adverse REMIC Event for any REMIC Pool or an Adverse Grantor Trust Event for the Grantor Trust Pool.

 (j) The Trust Advisor, the Trust Advisor's subcontractors and the Trust Advisor's Affiliates shall keep, and the Trust Advisor shall cause the Trust Advisor's subcontractors and the Trust Advisor's Affiliates to keep, all Privileged Information confidential and shall not disclose such information to any other Person (including any Certificateholders which are not then included in the Control-Eligible Certificates), other than to the extent expressly set forth herein.



 (k) As compensation for its activities hereunder, the Trust Advisor shall be entitled to receive monthly the Trust Advisor Ongoing Fee on each Distribution Date with respect to each Serviced Mortgage Loan and any related successor REO Mortgage Loan.  As to each such Serviced Mortgage Loan and related successor REO Mortgage Loan, the Trust Advisor Ongoing Fee shall accrue from time to time at the Trust Advisor Ongoing Fee Rate and shall be computed on the basis of the Stated Principal Balance of such Serviced Mortgage Loan or successor REO Mortgage Loan and in the same manner as interest is calculated thereon and for the same period respecting which any related interest payment due or deemed thereon is computed.  The Trust Advisor shall be entitled to reimbursement of any Trust Advisor Expenses provided for pursuant to Section 6.03(a), 6.03(b) and/or 6.05 hereof, such amounts to be reimbursed from amounts on deposit in the Collection Account as provided by Section 3.05(a)(xiv), but in the case of any Trust Advisor Expenses other than Designated Trust Advisor Expenses, reimbursements during any Collection Period shall not exceed the limit set







 forth for the related Distribution Date in Section 4.05(b) hereof.  The Trust Advisor hereby acknowledges and agrees that in no event will any Trust Advisor Expenses be payable from, and the Trust Advisor hereby waives any and all claims to, amounts distributable in respect of, the Control-Eligible Certificates; provided, that Designated Trust Advisor Expenses shall be reimbursable without limitation from the Collection Account as described in Section 3.05(a)(xiv).  Each successor Trust Advisor shall be required to acknowledge and agree to the terms of the preceding sentence.



 (l) As additional compensation for its activities hereunder, the Trust Advisor shall be entitled to receive the Trust Advisor Consulting Fee.  The Trust Advisor Consulting Fee shall be payable, subject to the limitations set forth below, in an amount equal to ten thousand dollars ($10,000) in connection with each Material Action for which the Trust Advisor engages in consultation under Section 3.24 and this Section 3.28; provided, that (i) no such fee shall be paid except to the extent such fee is actually paid by the applicable Borrower (and in no event shall such fee be paid from the Trust Fund); (ii) the Trust Advisor shall be entitled to waive all or any portion of such fee in its sole discretion; and (iii) the applicable Master Servicer or the applicable Special Servicer, as applicable, shall be authorized to waive the related Borrower's payment of such fee in whole or in part if the applicable Master Servicer or the applicable Special Servicer, as applicable, (A) determines that such waiver accords with the Servicing Standard and (B) consults with the Trust Advisor prior to effecting such waiver.  In connection with each Material Action for which the Trust Advisor has consultation rights under Section 3.24 or this Section 3.28, the applicable Master Servicer or the applicable Special Servicer, as applicable, shall use commercially reasonable efforts consistent with the Servicing Standard to collect the applicable Trust Advisor Consulting Fee from the related Borrower, in each case, only to the extent that such collection is not prohibited by the related Mortgage Loan Documents.  In no event shall the applicable Master Servicer or the applicable Special Servicer, as applicable, take any enforcement action in connection with the collection of such Trust Advisor Consulting Fee, except that this statement shall not be construed to prohibit requests for payment of such Trust Advisor Consulting Fee.  No Trust Advisor Consulting Fee shall be payable with respect to the Brunswick Square Loan Combination.



 (m) The Trust Advisor may be removed upon (i) the written direction of holders of Certificates entitled to not less than 25% of the aggregate Voting Rights (taking into account the allocation of any Appraisal Reduction Amounts in respect of the Mortgage Loans to notionally reduce the Class Principal Balances of the Principal Balance Certificates to which such Appraisal Reduction Amounts are allocable) of all Certificates on an aggregate basis requesting a vote to replace the Trust Advisor with a replacement Trust Advisor selected by such Certificateholders (provided that the proposed replacement Trust Advisor meets the criteria set forth in Section 3.28(o)), (ii) such requesting Holders making payment to the Certificate Administrator of all reasonable fees and expenses to be incurred by the Certificate Administrator in connection with administering such vote and (iii) such requesting Holders delivering to the Certificate Administrator a Rating Agency Confirmation from each Rating Agency regarding the appointment of the replacement Trust Advisor (which confirmations will be obtained at the expense of such requesting Holders and will not constitute an Additional Trust Fund Expense).  The Certificate Administrator shall promptly provide written notice to all Certificateholders of such request by posting such notice on the Certificate Administrator's Website in accordance with Section 8.12(b), and by mail, and conduct the solicitation of votes of all Certificates in such







 regard.  Upon the vote or written direction of Certificateholders of at least 75% of the aggregate Voting Rights (taking into account the allocation of any Appraisal Reduction Amounts in respect of the Mortgage Loans to notionally reduce the Class Principal Balances of the Principal Balance Certificates to which such Appraisal Reduction Amounts are allocable) of all Certificates on an aggregate basis, the Certificate Administrator shall notify the Trustee (and provide the Trustee with such information reasonably requested by the Trustee in connection with such direction or vote, as applicable), and the Trustee shall immediately replace the Trust Advisor with the replacement Trust Advisor.  If a proposed termination and replacement of the Trust Advisor as described above is not consummated within 180 days following the initial request of the Certificateholders who requested a vote, then the proposed termination and replacement shall have no further force or effect.  In addition, during any Subordinate Control Period, the identity of any replacement Trust Advisor proposed pursuant to this Section 3.28(m) shall be subject to the consent of the Subordinate Class Representative (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld), provided that such consent will be deemed to have been granted if no objection is made within ten (10) Business Days following the Subordinate Class Representative's receipt of the request for consent, and, if granted, such consent may not thereafter be revoked or withdrawn.



 (n) If (i) the Trust Advisor fails to duly observe or perform in any material respect any of its duties, covenants or obligations under this Agreement, (ii) an Insolvency Event occurs with respect to the Trust Advisor, or (iii) the Trust Advisor acknowledges in writing its inability to perform its duties hereunder, then either the Depositor or the Trustee may, and upon the written direction of Certificateholders representing at least 51% of the Voting Rights (taking into account the application of any Appraisal Reduction Amounts to notionally reduce the Certificate Principal Balance of the Classes of Certificates), the Trustee shall, terminate the Trust Advisor for cause.  Upon the termination of the Trust Advisor, a replacement Trust Advisor satisfying the conditions for such replacement in Section 3.28(o) below shall be selected by the Trustee.  In addition, during any Subordinate Control Period, the identity of the proposed replacement Trust Advisor shall be subject to the consent of the Subordinate Class Representative (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld), provided that such consent will be deemed to have been granted if no objection is made within ten (10) Business Days following the Subordinate Class Representative's receipt of the request for consent, and, if granted, such consent may not thereafter be revoked or withdrawn.  The Trustee may rely on a certification by the replacement Trust Advisor that it meets such criteria.  If the Trustee is unable to find a replacement Trust Advisor within thirty (30) days of the termination of the Trust Advisor, the Depositor shall be permitted to find a replacement.  Unless and until a replacement Trust Advisor is appointed, no party shall act as the Trust Advisor and the provisions relating to consultation and consent with respect to the Trust Advisor shall not be applicable until a replacement Trust Advisor is appointed hereunder.



 (o) Any replacement Trust Advisor shall (or all of the personnel responsible for supervising the obligations of the Trust Advisor shall) meet the following criteria:  (i) be regularly engaged in the business of analyzing and advising clients in commercial mortgage-backed securities matters and have at least five (5) years of experience in collateral analysis and loss projections, and (ii) have at least five (5) years of experience in commercial real estate asset management and experience in the workout and management of distressed commercial real estate assets.







 (p) The Trust Advisor shall be discharged from its duties hereunder when the Class Principal Balances of the Class A-1, Class A-2, Class A-3, Class A-4, Class A-5, Class A-SB and Class D Certificates, the Class A-S Regular Interest (and, therefore, the Class A-S Certificates and the Class A-S Component of the Class PEX Certificates), the Class B Regular Interest (and, therefore, the Class B Certificates and the Class B Component of the Class PEX Certificates) or the Class C Regular Interest (and, therefore, the Class C Certificates and the Class C Component of the Class PEX Certificates) have been reduced to zero.



 (q) The Trust Advisor may resign from its obligations and duties hereby imposed on it (a) upon thirty (30) days' prior written notice to the Depositor, the Master Servicers, the Special Servicers, the Certificate Administrator, the Trustee and the Subordinate Class Representative and the Majority Subordinate Certificateholder, (the latter two only if applicable), and (b) upon the appointment of, and the acceptance of such appointment by, a successor Trust Advisor meeting the eligibility requirements set forth in Section 3.28(o) and receipt by the Trustee and the Certificate Administrator of Rating Agency Confirmation from each Rating Agency.  During a Subordinate Control Period, the identity of the replacement Trust Advisor will be subject to the reasonable approval of the Subordinate Class Representative if the replacement Trust Advisor is a special servicer that (i) is not rated or approved by an NRSRO and (ii) has not acted as a trust advisor or operating advisor in connection with a rated commercial mortgage securitization transaction as of the Closing Date.  No such resignation by the Trust Advisor shall become effective until the replacement Trust Advisor shall have assumed the Trust Advisor's responsibilities and obligations.  The resigning Trust Advisor shall pay all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses of each party to this Agreement, the Trust and each Rating Agency in connection with the resignation of the Trust Advisor and the transfer of its duties (including, but not limited to, reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses associated with higher market fees of a successor, transferring related information, records and reports to the successor).



 (r) If the Trust Advisor resigns, is discharged or is otherwise terminated for any reason it shall remain entitled to any accrued and unpaid fees, Trust Advisor Expenses, indemnification amounts, and rights to indemnification which shall be payable in accordance with the priorities and subject to the limitations set forth herein including, without limitation, Section 4.05 hereof.



 (s) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement to the contrary, the parties hereto agree, and the Certificateholders by their acceptance of their Certificates shall be deemed to have agreed, that (i) there could be multiple strategies to resolve any Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan and that the goal of the Trust Advisor's participation is to provide monitoring (subject to, and in accordance with, the provisions of this Agreement) relating to the applicable Special Servicer's compliance with the Servicing Standard in making its determinations as to which strategy to execute, (ii) the Trust Advisor shall have no liability to any Certificateholder for any actions taken or for refraining from taking any actions under this Agreement, (iii) the agreements of the Trust Advisor set forth in the other provisions of this Agreement shall be construed solely as agreements to perform analytical and reporting services, (iv) the Trust Advisor shall have no authority or duty to make a determination on behalf of the Trust Fund, nor have any responsibility for decisions made by or on behalf of the Trust Fund, (v) insofar as the words "consult," "recommend" or words of similar import are used in this







 Agreement in respect of the Trust Advisor and any servicing action or inaction, such words shall be construed to mean the performance of analysis and reporting services, which the applicable Special Servicer may determine not to accept, (vi) the absence of a response by the Trust Advisor to an Asset Status Report or other matter in which this Agreement contemplates consultation with the Trust Advisor shall not be construed as an approval, endorsement, acquiescence or recommendation for or against any proposed action (but, in the event of such absence of a response, the applicable Special Servicer (x) shall be deemed to have complied with the relevant provision that otherwise required consultation with the Trust Advisor and (y) shall be entitled to proceed as if consultation with the Trust Advisor had not initially been required in connection with such Asset Status Report or other matter), (vii) any provision hereof that otherwise purports, or that may be construed, to impose on the Trust Advisor a duty to consider the Servicing Standard or the interests of the Certificateholders shall be construed as a requirement to use the Servicing Standard or such interests as the basis of measurement in its analysis and reporting and the basis of measurement in its evaluation of the performance of the applicable Special Servicer and its determination of whether an action, recommendation or report by the applicable Special Servicer is in compliance with this Agreement, and not to impose on the Trust Advisor a duty to itself comply with the Servicing Standard or itself act in the interests of the Certificateholders, and such basis of measurement shall be construed to refer to no particular class of Certificates or particular Certificateholders, (viii) no other party to this Agreement, and no Subordinate Class Representative, shall have any duty to monitor or supervise the performance by the Trust Advisor of its services under this Agreement and (ix) the Trust Advisor is not an "investment adviser" within the meaning of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended.  For the avoidance of doubt, the Trust Advisor shall not owe any fiduciary duty to any Person in connection with this Agreement.



 (t) The Trust Advisor shall not make any principal investment in any Certificate or interest therein; provided, that such prohibition shall not be construed to have been violated (i) in connection with riskless principal transactions effected by a broker-dealer Affiliate of the Trust Advisor or (ii) pursuant to investments by an Affiliate of the Trust Advisor if the Trust Advisor and such Affiliate maintain policies and procedures designed to segregate personnel involved in the activities of the Trust Advisor under this Agreement from personnel involved in such Affiliate's investment activities and to prevent such Affiliate and its personnel from gaining access to information regarding the Trust Fund and the Trust Advisor and its personnel from gaining access to such Affiliate's information regarding its investment activities.



 (u) The Trust Advisor shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not, to enter into any transaction as a result of which (i) the applicable Special Servicer or any Affiliate thereof would be obligated, whether by agreement or otherwise, and whether or not subject to any condition or contingency, to pay any fee to, or otherwise compensate or grant monetary or other consideration to, the Trust Advisor or any Affiliate thereof (other than compensation to which the Trust Advisor is entitled hereunder) (x) in connection with the Trust Advisor's obligations under this Agreement or (y) in consideration of the appointment or continuation of such Person as the applicable Special Servicer, (ii) the applicable Special Servicer would be entitled to receive any compensation from the Trust Advisor in connection with its activities under this Agreement or (iii) the applicable Special Servicer would be entitled to receive from the Trust Advisor or any Affiliate thereof any fee in connection with the appointment or continuation of such Person as Special Servicer unless, in the case of each of the foregoing clauses (i) through







 (iii), such transaction has been expressly approved by the Holders of Certificates representing 100% of the Voting Rights.



 (v) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Trust Advisor shall have no duty with respect to any Non-Trust-Serviced Pooled Mortgage Loan, or the assessment of the actions of any Special Servicer under this Agreement or any applicable Non-Trust Pooling and Servicing Agreement taken with respect to any such mortgage loan.

Upon becoming aware of or being named in any claim or litigation that falls within the scope of Litigation Control and is of a material nature, taking into account the subject matter of and expected costs associated with such claim or litigation (a "Material Litigation Control Matter"), the applicable Special Servicer or the applicable Master Servicer, as applicable, shall promptly notify the Subordinate Class Representative (during a Subordinate Control Period or Collective Consultation Period) and the Trust Advisor (during any Collective Consultation Period and any Senior Consultation Period) of such claim or litigation.

 (c) Funds on deposit in the Distribution Account on each Distribution Date that represent Prepayment Premiums or Yield Maintenance Charges Received by the Trust with respect to any Mortgage Loan or REO Mortgage Loan during the related Collection Period, in each case net of any Liquidation Fees payable therefrom, shall be distributable as follows:  if any Yield Maintenance Charge or Prepayment Premium is collected during any particular Collection Period with respect to any Mortgage Loan, then on the Distribution Date corresponding to that Collection Period, the Certificate Administrator shall pay a portion of that Yield Maintenance Charge or Prepayment Premium (net of Liquidation Fees payable therefrom) in the following manner:  (1) pro rata, between the (x) the group ("YM Group A") of Class A-1, Class A-2, Class A-3, Class A-4, Class A-5, Class A-SB and Class X-A Certificates and the Class A-S







 Regular Interest, and (y) the group ("YM Group B" and, collectively with YM Group A, the "YM Groups") of Class B and Class C Regular Interests and Class D and Class X-B Certificates, based upon the aggregate of principal distributed to the Classes of Principal Balance Certificates and Class A-S, Class B and/or Class C Regular Interest(s) in each YM Group for that Distribution Date, and (2) among the Classes of Certificates and Class A-S, Class B and/or Class C Regular Interest(s) in each YM Group, in the following manner, up to an amount equal to the product of (a) the Yield Maintenance Charge or Prepayment Premium allocated to such YM Group, (b) the related Base Interest Fraction, and (c) a fraction, which in no event may be greater than 1.0, the numerator of which is equal to the amount of principal distributed to the holder(s) of that such Class of Certificates or Class A-S, Class B or Class C Regular Interest for that Distribution Date, and the denominator of which is the total amount of principal distributed to all the Certificates and the Class A-S, Class B or Class C Regular Interest in that YM Group for that Distribution Date.  Any Yield Maintenance Charge or Prepayment Premium allocated to such YM Group remaining after such distributions will be distributed to the Class X-A or Class X-B Certificates, as applicable, in such YM Group.  No Prepayment Premiums or Yield Maintenance Charges will be distributed to the Holders of the Class E, Class F, Class G, Class R or Class V Certificates.  The Holders of the Class X-B Certificates will also be entitled to all Prepayment Premiums and Yield Maintenance Charges collected after the Class A-1, Class A-2, Class A-3, Class A-4, Class A-5, Class A-SB, and Class D Certificates, the Class A-S Regular Interest (and, therefore, the Class A-S Certificates and the Class A-S Component of the Class PEX Certificates), the Class B Regular Interest (and, therefore, the Class B Certificates and the Class B Component of the Class PEX Certificates) and the Class C Regular Interest (and, therefore, the Class C Certificates and the Class C Component of the Class PEX Certificates) are retired.  Any funds distributed on any such Class of Certificates or Class A-S, Class B or Class C Regular Interest in respect of any Prepayment Premium or Yield Maintenance Charge pursuant to this Section 4.01(c) shall constitute an "Additional Yield Amount" for such Class.



 (d) Any distributions of Yield Maintenance Charges and Prepayment Premiums in respect of the Class A-S, Class B or Class C Regular Interest on any Distribution Date shall be distributed (i) in the case of the Class A-S Regular Interest, between the Class A-S Certificates and Class A-S-PEX Component in accordance with the Class A-S Percentage Interest for such Distribution Date and the Class A-S-PEX Percentage Interest for such Distribution Date, respectively, (ii) in the case of the Class B Regular Interest, between the Class B Certificates and Class B-PEX Component in accordance with the Class B Percentage Interest for such Distribution Date and the Class B-PEX Percentage Interest for such Distribution Date, respectively, and (iii) in the case of the Class C Regular Interest, between the Class C Certificates and Class C-PEX Component in accordance with the Class C Percentage Interest for such Distribution Date and the Class C-PEX Percentage Interest for such Distribution Date, respectively.



 For purposes of the immediately preceding paragraph, the relevant "Base Interest Fraction" in connection with any Principal Prepayment of any Mortgage Loan that provides for the payment of a Yield Maintenance Charge or Prepayment Premium, and with respect to any Class of Principal Balance Certificates (other than the Class A-S, Class B, Class C and Class PEX Certificates) and the Class A-S, Class B and Class C Regular Interests, shall be a fraction (A) the numerator of which is the greater of (x) zero and (y) the difference between (i) the Pass-Through Rate on such Class or the Class A-S, Class B or Class C Regular Interest, as applicable,







 for the related Distribution Date, and (ii) the applicable Discount Rate and (B) the denominator of which is the difference between (i) the Mortgage Rate on such Mortgage Loan and (ii) the applicable Discount Rate; provided, that:  (a) under no circumstances will the Base Interest Fraction be greater than 1.0; (b) if the applicable Discount Rate is greater than or equal to the Mortgage Rate on such Mortgage Loan and is greater than or equal to the Pass-Through Rate on such Class for the related Distribution Date, then the Base Interest Fraction will equal zero; and (c) if the applicable Discount Rate is greater than or equal to the Mortgage Rate on such Mortgage Loan and is less than the Pass-Through Rate on such Class for the related Distribution Date, then the Base Interest Fraction shall be equal to 1.0.  If a Mortgage Loan provides for a step-up in the Mortgage Rate, then the Mortgage Rate used in the determination of the Base Interest Fraction will be the Mortgage Rate in effect at the time of the prepayment.



 For purposes of the preceding paragraph, the relevant "Discount Rate" in connection with any Prepayment Premium or Yield Maintenance Charge collected on any prepaid Mortgage Loan or REO Mortgage Loan and distributable on any Distribution Date shall be a rate per annum equal to (i) if a discount rate was used in the calculation of the applicable Prepayment Premium or Yield Maintenance Charge pursuant to the terms of the relevant Mortgage Loan or REO Mortgage Loan, as the case may be, such discount rate (as reported by the applicable Master Servicer), converted (if necessary) to a monthly equivalent yield, or (ii) if a discount rate was not used in the calculation of the applicable Prepayment Premium or Yield Maintenance Charge pursuant to the terms of the relevant Mortgage Loan or REO Mortgage Loan, as the case may be, the yield calculated by the linear interpolation of the yields (as reported under the heading "UxxPDSxxPD Government Securities/Treasury Constant Maturities" in Federal Reserve Statistical Release H.15 (519) published by the Federal Reserve Board for the week most recently ended before the date of the relevant prepayment (or deemed prepayment) of UxxPDSxxPD Treasury constant maturities with a maturity date, one longer and one shorter, most nearly approximating the related Stated Maturity Date (in the case of a Mortgage Loan or REO Mortgage Loan that is not related to an ARD Mortgage Loan) or the related Anticipated Repayment Date (in the case of a Mortgage Loan or REO Mortgage Loan that is related to an ARD Mortgage Loan), such interpolated yield converted to a monthly equivalent yield.  If Federal Reserve Statistical Release H.15 (519) is no longer published, the Certificate Administrator shall select a comparable publication as the source of the applicable yields of UxxPDSxxPD Treasury constant maturities.



 (e) On each Distribution Date, the Certificate Administrator shall withdraw from the Distribution Account any amounts then on deposit in the Class V Sub-Account that represent Post-ARD Additional Interest collected or deemed collected in respect of the Mortgage Loans or REO Mortgage Loans related to ARD Mortgage Loans during the related Collection Period and shall distribute such amounts to the Holders of the Class V Certificates.



 (f) On each Distribution Date, the Certificate Administrator shall withdraw from the REMIC III Sub-Account for deposit in the Exchangeable Sub-Account all amounts distributed or deemed distributed to the REMIC III Regular Interests and shall withdraw from the Exchangeable Sub-Account all amounts actually distributed to the Holders of the Exchangeable Certificates.







 (g) All distributions made with respect to each Class of Certificates on each Distribution Date shall be allocated pro rata among the outstanding Certificates in such Class based on their respective Percentage Interests.  Except as otherwise provided below, all such distributions with respect to each Class of Certificates on each Distribution Date shall be made to the Certificateholders of the respective Class of record at the close of business on the related Record Date and shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account of any such Certificateholder at a bank or other entity having appropriate facilities therefor, if such Certificateholder shall have provided the Certificate Administrator with wiring instructions no less than five (5) Business Days prior to the related Record Date (which wiring instructions may be in the form of a standing order applicable to all subsequent Distribution Dates), or otherwise by check mailed to the address of such Certificateholder as it appears in the Certificate Register.  The final distribution on each Certificate (determined, in the case of a Principal Balance Certificate, without regard to any possible future reimbursement of any Realized Loss or Additional Trust Fund Expense previously allocated to such Certificate pursuant to Section 4.04(a)) will be made in a like manner, but only upon presentation and surrender of such Certificate at the offices of the Certificate Registrar or such other location specified in the notice to Certificateholders of such final distribution.  Prior to any termination of the Trust Fund pursuant to Section 9.01, any distribution that is to be made with respect to a Certificate in reimbursement of a Realized Loss or Additional Trust Fund Expense previously allocated thereto, which reimbursement is to occur after the date on which such Certificate is surrendered as contemplated by the preceding sentence, will be made by check mailed to the address of the Certificateholder that surrendered such Certificate as such address last appeared in the Certificate Register or to any other address of which the Certificate Administrator was subsequently notified in writing.  If such check is returned to the Certificate Administrator, then the Certificate Administrator, directly or through an agent, shall take such reasonable steps to contact the related Holder and deliver such check as it shall deem appropriate.  Any funds in respect of a check returned to the Certificate Administrator shall be set aside by the Certificate Administrator and held uninvested in trust and credited to the account of the appropriate Holder.  The costs and expenses of locating the appropriate Holder and holding such funds shall be paid out of such funds.  No interest shall accrue or be payable to any former Holder on any amount held in trust hereunder.  If the Certificate Administrator has not, after having taken such reasonable steps, located the related Holder by the second anniversary of the initial sending of a check, the Certificate Administrator shall, subject to applicable law, distribute the unclaimed funds to the Class R Certificateholders.



 (h) Each distribution with respect to a Book-Entry Certificate shall be paid to the Depository, as Holder thereof, and the Depository shall be responsible for crediting the amount of such distribution to the accounts of its Depository Participants in accordance with its normal procedures.  Each Depository Participant shall be responsible for disbursing such distribution to the related Certificate Owners that it represents and to each indirect participating brokerage firm for which it acts as agent.  Each indirect participating brokerage firm shall be responsible for disbursing funds to the related Certificate Owners that it represents.  None of the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator, the Certificate Registrar, the Trust Advisor, the Depositor, the applicable Special Servicer or the applicable Master Servicer shall have any responsibility therefor except as otherwise provided by this Agreement or applicable law.  The Certificate Administrator and the Depositor shall perform their respective obligations under each letter of representations between the Issuer and the initial Depository dated as of the Closing Date and







 pertaining to the Book-Entry Certificates, a copy of which Letters of Representation are attached hereto as Exhibit B.



 (i) The rights of the Certificateholders to receive distributions from the proceeds of the Trust Fund with respect to the Certificates, and all rights and interests of the Certificateholders in and to such distributions, shall be as set forth in this Agreement.  Neither the Holders of any Class of Certificates nor any party hereto shall in any way be responsible or liable to the Holders of any other Class of Certificates with respect to amounts properly previously distributed on the Certificates.



 (j) Except as otherwise provided in Section 9.01, whenever the Certificate Administrator receives written notification of or expects that the final distribution with respect to any Class of Certificates (determined, in the case of a Class of Principal Balance Certificates or REMIC III Regular Interest, without regard to any possible future reimbursement of any Realized Loss or Additional Trust Fund Expense previously allocated to such Class of Certificates pursuant to Section 4.04(a)) will be made on the next Distribution Date, the Certificate Administrator shall, no later than the second Business Day prior to such Distribution Date, mail to each Holder of record of such Class of Certificates on such date (with a copy to be posted to the Certificate Administrator's Website in accordance with Section 8.12(b)) a notice to the effect that:



 (i) the Certificate Administrator expects that the final distribution with respect to such Class of Certificates will be made on such Distribution Date but only upon presentation and surrender of such Certificates at the office of the Certificate Registrar or at such other location therein specified, and



 (ii) no interest shall accrue on such Certificates from and after the end of the Interest Accrual Period for such Distribution Date.



 Any funds not distributed to any Holder or Holders of Certificates of such Class on such Distribution Date because of the failure of such Holder or Holders to tender their Certificates shall, on such date, be set aside and held uninvested in trust and credited to the account or accounts of the appropriate non-tendering Holder or Holders.  If any Certificates as to which notice has been given pursuant to this Section 4.01(h) shall not have been surrendered for cancellation within six (6) months after the time specified in such notice, the Certificate Administrator shall mail a second notice to the remaining non-tendering Certificateholders to surrender their Certificates for cancellation in order to receive the final distribution with respect thereto.  If within one year after the second notice all such Certificates shall not have been surrendered for cancellation, then the Certificate Administrator, directly or through an agent, shall take such steps to contact the remaining non-tendering Certificateholders concerning the surrender of their Certificates as it shall deem appropriate.  The costs and expenses of holding such funds in trust and of contacting such non-tendering Certificateholders following the first anniversary of the delivery of such second notice thereto shall be paid out of such funds.  No interest shall accrue or be payable to any former Holder on any amount held in trust pursuant to this paragraph.  If all of the Certificates as to which notice has been given pursuant to this Section 4.01(h) shall not have been surrendered for cancellation by the second anniversary of the delivery of the second notice, the Certificate Administrator shall, subject to applicable law,







 distribute to the Class R Certificateholders all unclaimed funds and other assets which remain subject thereto.



 (k) All distributions made in respect of each Class of Principal Balance Certificates  (other than the Class A-S, Class B, Class C and Class PEX Certificates) and the Class A-S, Class B and Class C Regular Interests on each Distribution Date (including the Final Distribution Date) pursuant to Section 4.01(a) or Section 4.01(b) shall be deemed to have first been distributed from REMIC II to REMIC III with respect to the Corresponding REMIC II Regular Interest(s) for such Class of Principal Balance Certificates or the Class A-S, Class B or Class C Regular Interest; and all distributions made with respect to any Class of Interest Only Certificates on each Distribution Date pursuant to Section 4.01(a) or Section 4.01(b), and allocable to any particular REMIC III Component of such Class of Interest Only Certificates or the Class A-S Regular Interest, shall be deemed to have first been distributed from REMIC II to REMIC III in respect of the Corresponding REMIC II Regular Interest for such REMIC III Component.  In each case, if such distribution on any such Class of Certificates was a distribution of accrued interest, of principal, of additional interest (in the form of one or more Additional Yield Amounts) or in reimbursement of any Realized Losses and Additional Trust Fund Expenses previously allocated to such Class of Principal Balance Certificates or the Class A-S, Class B or Class C Regular Interest, then the corresponding distribution deemed to be made on a REMIC II Regular Interest pursuant to the preceding sentence (and, if applicable the next paragraph) shall be deemed to also be, respectively, a distribution of accrued interest, of principal, of additional interest (in the form of one or more Additional Yield Amounts) or in reimbursement of any Realized Losses and Additional Trust Fund Expenses previously allocated to REMIC III in respect of such REMIC II Regular Interest.



 All such amounts deemed distributed shall be deemed to have been withdrawn from the REMIC II Sub-Account for deposit in the REMIC III Sub-Account on such Distribution Date.



 (l) On each Distribution Date, including the Final Distribution Date, the Available Distribution Amount for such date shall be deemed to have first been distributed from REMIC I to REMIC II in respect of the REMIC I Regular Interests, in each case to the extent of the remaining portions of such funds, for the following purposes and in the following order of priority:



 (i) as deemed distributions of interest with respect to all the REMIC I Regular Interests, up to an amount equal to, and pro rata in accordance with, all Uncertificated Distributable Interest with respect to each REMIC I Regular Interest for such Distribution Date and, to the extent not previously deemed distributed, for all prior Distribution Dates;



 (ii) as deemed distributions of principal with respect to all the REMIC I Regular Interests, up to an amount equal to, and pro rata in accordance with, as to each REMIC I Regular Interest, the portion of the Principal Distribution Amount for such Distribution Date attributable to the related Mortgage Loan(s) or REO Mortgage Loan(s); and







 (iii) as deemed distributions with respect to all the REMIC I Regular Interests, up to an amount equal to, pro rata in accordance with, and in reimbursement of, any Realized Losses, Additional Trust Fund Expenses and Trust Advisor Expenses previously allocated to each REMIC I Regular Interest (with compounded interest).



 The portion of each Prepayment Premium and Yield Maintenance Charge that is distributed to any Class of Regular Certificates or the Class A-S, Class B or Class C Regular Interest on any Distribution Date shall, in each case, be deemed to have been distributed from REMIC I to REMIC II in respect of the REMIC I Regular Interest(s) corresponding to the prepaid Mortgage Loan or REO Mortgage Loan, as the case may be, in respect of which such Prepayment Premium or Yield Maintenance Charge was received or deemed received.



 The actual distributions made by the Certificate Administrator on each Distribution Date in respect of the Regular Certificates or the Class A-S, Class B or Class C Regular Interest pursuant to Section 4.01(a) or Section 4.01(c), as applicable, shall be deemed to have been so made from the amounts deemed distributed with respect to the REMIC I Regular Interests on such Distribution Date pursuant to this Section 4.01(k).  All such amounts deemed distributed shall be deemed to have been withdrawn from the REMIC I Sub-Account for deposit in the REMIC II Sub-Account on such Distribution Date.

 The Certificate Administrator shall have no obligation to provide the information or reports described in this Section 4.02(a) until it has received the requisite information or reports from the applicable Master Servicer provided for herein, and the Certificate Administrator shall not be in default hereunder due to a delay in providing such information and reports caused by the failure of the applicable Master Servicer or the applicable Special Servicer to timely deliver any information or reports hereunder.  None of the applicable Master Servicer, the applicable Special Servicer or the Certificate Administrator shall be responsible for the accuracy or completeness of any information supplied to it by a Borrower, each other or a third party, and accepted by it in good faith, that is included in any reports, statements, materials or information prepared or provided by the applicable Master Servicer, the applicable Special Servicer or the Certificate Administrator, as applicable.

 registration of any Non-Registered Certificates pursuant to Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933."



 The Certificate Administrator makes no representations or warranties as to the accuracy or completeness of any report, document or other information made available on the Certificate Administrator's Website and assumes no responsibility therefor.  In addition, the Certificate Administrator may disclaim responsibility for any information distributed by the Certificate Administrator for which it is not the original source.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the applicable Master Servicer







 shall not be required to prepare and deliver any of such files or reports with respect to the initial Determination Date following the Closing Date.



 The applicable Master Servicer may, but is not required to, make any of the reports or files comprising the CREFC® Investor Reporting Package prepared by it available each month on the applicable Master Servicer's internet website only with the use of a password, in which case the applicable Master Servicer shall provide such password to (i) the other parties to this Agreement, who by their acceptance of such password shall be deemed to have agreed not to disclose such password to any other Person, (ii) the Subordinate Class Representative, and (iii) each Certificateholder and Certificate Owner who requests such password, provided that (A) the applicable Master Servicer shall not have such authority to the extent such disclosure would violate another provision of this Agreement (including without limitation, any prohibitions on dissemination of any confidential information, including, without limitation, any Privileged Information), applicable law or the related Mortgage Loan Documents and (B) any such Certificateholder or Certificate Owner, as the case may be, has delivered a certification substantially in the form of Exhibit K-1 to the Certificate Administrator (with a copy to the applicable Master Servicer).

 (g) Certain General Provisions Regarding Reporting.  The applicable Special Servicer shall deliver to the applicable Master Servicer(s) the reports and files required to be delivered pursuant to Section 4.02(d) and Section 4.02(e) and the applicable Master Servicer(s) shall deliver to the Certificate Administrator the reports set forth in Section 4.02(c) and Section 4.02(f), in an electronic format reasonably acceptable to the applicable Special Servicer, the applicable Master Servicer and the Certificate Administrator.

Furthermore, if any report to be provided to the Certificate Administrator and/or the Subordinate Class Representative by the applicable Master Servicer pursuant to Section 4.02(c), Section 4.02(d) or Section 4.02(f) was to be prepared by the applicable Special Servicer and delivered to the applicable Master Servicer, the applicable Master Servicer shall not be in breach by reason of any delay in its delivery of such report to the Certificate Administrator, the Subordinate Class Representative and/or the Majority Subordinate Certificateholder by reason of a delay on the part of the applicable Special Servicer; and the applicable Master Servicer shall deliver as promptly as reasonably practicable to the Certificate Administrator, the Subordinate Class Representative and the Majority Subordinate Certificateholder any such report that it receives from the applicable Special Servicer after the requisite delivery date.

 Section 4.03 P&I Advances.



 (a) On or before 1:00 pxxPDmxxPD (New York City time) on each P&I Advance Date, the applicable Master Servicer shall, subject to Section 4.03(c), either (i) remit from its own funds to the Certificate Administrator for deposit into the Distribution Account an amount equal to the aggregate amount of P&I Advances with respect to Mortgage Loans and successor REO Mortgage Loans serviced by such Master Servicer, if any, to be made by the applicable Master Servicer in respect of the related Distribution Date, (ii) apply amounts held in the Collection Account for future distribution to Certificateholders in subsequent months in discharge of any such obligation to make such P&I Advances, or (iii) make such P&I Advances in the form of any combination of (i) and (ii) aggregating the total amount of P&I Advances to be made by the applicable Master Servicer; provided, however, that to the extent that amounts on deposit in the Collection Account were insufficient to pay the CREFC® License Fee on the related Master Servicer Remittance Date, the applicable Master Servicer shall apply any P&I Advances required to be made by it on such P&I Advance Date pursuant to this Section 4.03 to pay the balance of such CREFC® License Fee.  Any amounts held in the Collection Account for future distribution and so used to make P&I Advances shall be appropriately reflected in the applicable Master Servicer's records and replaced by the applicable Master Servicer by deposit in the Collection Account prior to the next succeeding Master Servicer Remittance Date (to the extent not previously replaced through the deposit of Late Collections of the delinquent principal and interest in respect of which such P&I Advances were made).  If, as of 3:30 pxxPDmxxPD (New York City time) on any P&I Advance Date, the applicable Master Servicer shall not have made any P&I Advance required to be made by it on such date pursuant to this Section 4.03(a) (and shall not have delivered to the Certificate Administrator and the Trustee the Officer's Certificate and other







 documentation related to a determination of nonrecoverability of a P&I Advance pursuant to Section 4.03(c)) or shall not have remitted any portion of the Master Servicer Remittance Amount required to be remitted by such Master Servicer on such date, then the Certificate Administrator shall provide notice of such failure to the applicable Master Servicer by facsimile transmission (with respect to the General Master Servicer, at facsimile number:  (704) 715-0034, and with respect to the NCB Master Servicer, at (703) 647-3470) and by telephone (with respect to the General Master Servicer, at (800) 326-1334, and with respect to the NCB Master Servicer, at (703) 302-8851) and, in the case of the NCB Master Servicer, by email (at WFRBS2014C19@ncb.com) as soon as possible, but in any event before 4:30 pxxPDmxxPD (New York City time) on such P&I Advance Date.  If after such notice the Certificate Administrator does not receive the full amount of such P&I Advances by 9:00 axxPDmxxPD (New York City time) on the related Distribution Date, then the Certificate Administrator shall promptly notify the Trustee (but in any event before 10:00 axxPDmxxPD (New York City time) and the Trustee shall (not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the related Distribution Date) make the portion of such P&I Advances that was required to be, but was not, made or remitted, as the case may be, by the applicable Master Servicer with respect to the related Distribution Date.



 (b) The aggregate amount of P&I Advances to be made by each Master Servicer (or by the Trustee, if the applicable Master Servicer fails to do so) in respect of any Distribution Date, subject to Section 4.03(c) below, shall equal the aggregate of all Monthly Payments (other than Balloon Payments) and any Assumed Monthly Payments, in each case net of any related Master Servicing Fees (and, in the case of a Non-Trust-Serviced Pooled Mortgage Loan or REO Mortgage Loan that is a successor thereto, the Non-Trust Primary Servicing Fee and Non-Trust Trust Advisor fee payable under the related Non-Trust Pooling and Servicing Agreement), due or deemed due and net of any Post-ARD Additional Interest, as the case may be, in respect of the Mortgage Loans for which it is acting as Master Servicer and any successor REO Mortgage Loans with respect thereto on their respective Due Dates occurring in the month in which such Distribution Date occurs, in each case to the extent such amount was not Received by the Trust as of the close of business on the related Determination Date; provided that, if an Appraisal Reduction Amount exists with respect to any Required Appraisal Loan, then the interest portion of any P&I Advance required to be made in respect of such Required Appraisal Loan for the related Distribution Date shall be reduced (it being herein acknowledged that there shall be no reduction in the principal portion of such P&I Advance) to equal the product of (i) the amount of the interest portion of such P&I Advance that would otherwise be required to be made in respect of such Required Appraisal Loan for such Distribution Date without regard to this proviso, multiplied by (ii) a fraction, expressed as a percentage, the numerator of which shall equal the Stated Principal Balance of such Required Appraisal Loan immediately prior to such Distribution Date, net of the related Appraisal Reduction Amount, and the denominator of which shall equal the Stated Principal Balance of such Required Appraisal Loan immediately prior to such Distribution Date.



 (c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no P&I Advance shall be required to be made hereunder if such P&I Advance would, if made, constitute a Nonrecoverable P&I Advance.  The determination by the applicable Master Servicer (or, if applicable, the Trustee) that a prior P&I Advance (or Unliquidated Advance in respect thereof) that it has made constitutes a Nonrecoverable P&I Advance or that any proposed P&I Advance, if made, would constitute a Nonrecoverable P&I Advance, shall be made by such Person in its reasonable, good







 faith judgment.  In making such recoverability determination, such Person will be entitled to consider (among other things) the obligations of the Borrower under the terms of the related Mortgage Loan as it may have been modified, to consider (among other things) the related Mortgaged Properties in their "as is" or then-current conditions and occupancies, as modified by such party's assumptions regarding the possibility and effects of future adverse change with respect to such Mortgaged Properties, to estimate and consider (among other things) future expenses and to estimate and consider (among other things) the timing of recoveries.  In addition, any such Person may update or change its recoverability determinations at any time and may obtain from the applicable Special Servicer any analysis, Appraisals or market value estimates or other information in the possession of the applicable Special Servicer for such purposes.  Any determination by the applicable Master Servicer (or, if applicable, the Trustee) that it has made a Nonrecoverable P&I Advance or that any proposed P&I Advance, if made, would constitute a Nonrecoverable P&I Advance, shall be evidenced by an Officer's Certificate delivered to the Depositor, the applicable Special Servicer, the Certificate Administrator, the Subordinate Class Representative and, if made by the applicable Master Servicer, the Trustee (on or before the related P&I Advance Date in the case of a proposed P&I Advance), setting forth the basis for such determination, accompanied by a copy of an Appraisal of the related Mortgaged Property or REO Property performed within the nine (9) months preceding such determination by a Qualified Appraiser, and further accompanied by any other information, including engineers' reports, environmental surveys or similar reports, that the Person making such determination may have obtained.  A copy of any such Officer's Certificate (and accompanying information) of the Trustee shall also be promptly delivered to the Certificate Administrator, the Subordinate Class Representative, the Majority Subordinate Certificateholder, the applicable Special Servicer and the applicable Master Servicer for the subject Mortgage Loan.  Absent bad faith, the applicable Master Servicer's determination as to the recoverability of any P&I Advance shall be conclusive and binding on the Certificateholders and, in all cases, the Trustee shall be entitled to conclusively rely on any nonrecoverability determination made by the applicable Master Servicer with respect to a particular P&I Advance.  The applicable Special Servicer shall promptly furnish any party required to make P&I Advances hereunder with any information in its possession regarding the Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans and REO Properties as such party required to make P&I Advances may reasonably request.  The applicable Master Servicer shall consider Unliquidated Advances in respect of prior P&I Advances as outstanding Advances for purposes of recoverability determinations as if such Unliquidated Advance were a P&I Advance.



 The applicable Special Servicer for each Mortgage Loan shall also be entitled to make a determination (subject to the same standards and procedures that apply in connection with a determination by the applicable Master Servicer) to the effect that a prior P&I Advance (or Unliquidated Advance in respect thereof) previously made hereunder by the applicable Master Servicer (or, if applicable, the Trustee) constitutes a Nonrecoverable P&I Advance or that any proposed P&I Advance by the applicable Master Servicer (or, if applicable, the Trustee), if made, would constitute a Nonrecoverable P&I Advance, in which case, after written notice of such determination by the applicable Special Servicer to the applicable Master Servicer and the Trustee, such determination shall be conclusive and binding on the applicable Master Servicer and the Trustee and such P&I Advance shall constitute a Nonrecoverable P&I Advance for all purposes of this Agreement and the applicable Master Servicer and the Trustee shall conclusively rely on such determination by the applicable Special Servicer that a P&I Advance is







 a Nonrecoverable Advance; provided that in no event shall a determination by the applicable Special Servicer that a previously made or proposed P&I Advance would be recoverable be binding on the applicable Master Servicer or the Trustee.  A copy of any Officer's Certificate (and accompanying information) of the applicable Special Servicer in support of its determination shall be promptly delivered to the applicable Master Servicer for the subject Mortgage Loan.  The applicable Special Servicer may update or change its recoverability determination at any time.



 (d) In the case of each Mortgage Loan, the applicable Master Servicer and the Trustee shall each be entitled to receive interest at the Reimbursement Rate in effect from time to time, accrued on the amount of each P&I Advance made thereby (with its own funds), to the extent that such P&I Advance (i) relates to a Monthly Payment or Assumed Monthly Payment in respect of a Mortgage Loan that is a Past Grace Period Loan or an REO Mortgage Loan when made, in which case such interest shall begin to accrue from the related P&I Advance Date, or (ii) is made with respect to a Within Grace Period Loan and remains outstanding when the subject Mortgage Loan becomes a Past Grace Period Loan in respect of the subject Monthly Payment or Assumed Monthly Payment, in which case such interest shall begin to accrue when the subject Mortgage Loan becomes a Past Grace Period Loan in respect of the subject Monthly Payment or Assumed Monthly Payment, in either case, for so long as such P&I Advance is outstanding (or, in the case of Advance Interest payable to the applicable Master Servicer, if earlier, until the Late Collection of the delinquent principal and/or interest in respect of which such P&I Advance was made has been Received by the Trust).  Such interest with respect to any P&I Advance shall be payable:  (i) first, in accordance with Sections 3.05 and 3.25, out of any Default Charges subsequently collected on the particular Mortgage Loan or REO Mortgage Loan as to which such P&I Advance relates; and (ii) then, after such P&I Advance is reimbursed, but only if and to the extent that such Default Charges are insufficient to cover such Advance Interest, out of general collections on the Mortgage Loans and REO Properties on deposit in the Collection Account.  The applicable Master Servicer shall (subject to the operation of Section 3.05(a)(II)) reimburse itself or the Trustee, as applicable, for any outstanding P&I Advance made thereby with respect to any Mortgage Loan or REO Mortgage Loan as soon as practicable after funds available for such purpose are deposited in the Collection Account, and in no event shall interest accrue in accordance with this Section 4.03(d) on any P&I Advance as to which the corresponding Late Collection was received by or on behalf of the Trust as of the related P&I Advance Date.



 (e) In connection with any Non-Trust-Serviced Pooled Mortgage Loan, any determination by the applicable Master Servicer that any P&I Advance made or to be made with respect to such Non-Trust-Serviced Pooled Mortgage Loan (or any successor REO Mortgage Loan with respect thereto) is or, if made, would be a Nonrecoverable P&I Advance may be made independently from any determinations (or the absence of any determinations) made by the related Non-Trust Master Servicer regarding nonrecoverability of debt service advances on the related Non-Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan.



 The applicable Special Servicer for each Serviced Loan Combination or Non-Trust-Serviced Pooled Mortgage Loan shall also be entitled to make a determination (subject to the same standards and procedures that apply in connection with a determination by the applicable Master Servicer) to the effect that a prior P&I Advance (or Unliquidated Advance







 in respect thereof) previously made hereunder by the applicable Master Servicer (or, if applicable, the Trustee) constitutes a Nonrecoverable P&I Advance or that any proposed P&I Advance by the applicable Master Servicer (or, if applicable, the Trustee), if made, would constitute a Nonrecoverable P&I Advance, in which case, after written notice of such determination by the applicable Special Servicer to the applicable Master Servicer and the Trustee, such P&I Advance shall constitute a Nonrecoverable P&I Advance for all purposes of this Agreement and the applicable Master Servicer and the Trustee shall conclusively rely on such determination by the applicable Special Servicer that a P&I Advance is a Nonrecoverable Advance; provided that in no event shall a determination by a Special Servicer that a previously made or proposed P&I Advance would be recoverable be binding on a Master Servicer or the Trustee.  A copy of any Officer's Certificate (and accompanying information) of the applicable Special Servicer in support of its determination shall be promptly delivered to the applicable Master Servicer for the subject Mortgage Loan.  The applicable Special Servicer may update or change its recoverability determination at any time.



 (f) With regard to such P&I Advances, the applicable Master Servicer or the Trustee shall account for that part of the P&I Advances which is attributable to Past Grace Period Loans, and that part of the P&I Advances which is attributable to Within Grace Period Loans.



 (g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, no P&I Advances shall be made with respect to any Pari Passu Companion Loan (whether or not it constitutes a Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan or otherwise) or any successor REO Mortgage Loan related thereto.



 Section 4.04 Allocation of Realized Losses and Additional Trust Fund Expenses.



 (a) On each Distribution Date, following the distributions to Certificateholders to be made on such date pursuant to Section 4.01, the Certificate Administrator shall determine the amount, if any, by which (i) the then aggregate of the Class Principal Balances of all the Classes of Principal Balance Certificates (other than the Class A-S, Class B, Class C and Class PEX Certificates) and the Class A-S, Class B and Class C Regular Interests,  exceeds (ii) the aggregate Stated Principal Balance of the Mortgage Pool that will be outstanding immediately following such Distribution Date.  If such excess does exist, then, except to the extent that such excess exists because of the reimbursement of Workout-Delayed Reimbursement Amounts (from the principal portions of P&I Advances and/or payments or other collections of principal on the Mortgage Pool pursuant to subsection (II)(iii) of Section 3.05(a)) during any prior Collection Period (other than those that were determined to constitute Nonrecoverable Advances in the immediately preceding Collection Period), the Class Principal Balances of the Class G, Class F, Class E and Class D Certificates and the Class C, Class B and Class A-S Regular Interests shall be reduced sequentially, in that order, in each case, until such excess or the related Class Principal Balance is reduced to zero (whichever occurs first).  If, after the foregoing reductions, the amount described in clause (i) of the second preceding sentence still exceeds the amount described in clause (ii) of such sentence, then, except to the extent that such excess exists because of the reimbursement of Workout-Delayed Reimbursement Amounts (from the principal portion of P&I Advances and/or payments or other collections of principal on the Mortgage Pool pursuant to subsection (II)(iii) of Section 3.05(a)) during any prior Collection Period (other than those that were determined to constitute







 Nonrecoverable Advances in the immediately preceding Collection Period), the respective Class Principal Balances of all the outstanding Classes of the Class A Certificates (other than the Class A-S Certificates) shall be reduced on a pro rata basis in accordance with the relative sizes of such Class Principal Balances, until any such remaining excess is reduced to zero.  All reductions in the Class Principal Balances of the respective Classes of the Principal Balance Certificates and the Class A-S, Class B and Class C Regular Interests under this subsection (a) shall constitute allocations of Realized Losses and Additional Trust Fund Expenses.  Any reduction in the Class Principal Balance of the Class C, Class B or Class A-S Regular Interest for any Distribution Date pursuant to this Section 4.04(a) shall be allocated (i) in the case of the Class C Regular Interest, between the Class C Certificates and Class C-PEX Component in accordance with the Class C Percentage Interest for such Distribution Date and the Class C-PEX Percentage Interest for such Distribution Date, respectively, (ii) in the case of the Class B Regular Interest, between the Class B Certificates and Class B-PEX Component in accordance with the Class B Percentage Interest for such Distribution Date and the Class B-PEX Percentage Interest for such Distribution Date, respectively and (iii) in the case of the Class A-S Regular Interest, between the Class A-S Certificates and Class A-S-PEX Component in accordance with the Class A-S Percentage Interest for such Distribution Date and the Class A-S-PEX Percentage Interest for such Distribution Date, respectively.



 (b) On each Distribution Date, following the deemed distributions to be made in respect of the REMIC II Regular Interests on such date pursuant to Section 4.01(i), the Certificate Administrator shall determine the amount, if any, by which (i) the then-aggregate Uncertificated Principal Balance of the REMIC II Regular Interests, exceeds (ii) the aggregate Stated Principal Balance of the Mortgage Pool that will be outstanding immediately following such Distribution Date.  If such excess does exist, then, except to the extent that such excess exists because of the reimbursement of Workout-Delayed Reimbursement Amounts (from the principal portion of P&I Advances and/or payments or other collections of principal on the Mortgage Pool pursuant to subsection (II)(iii) of Section 3.05(a)) during the preceding Collection Period, the Uncertificated Principal Balances of REMIC II Regular Interest G, REMIC II Regular Interest F, REMIC II Regular Interest E, REMIC II Regular Interest D, REMIC II Regular Interest C, REMIC II Regular Interest B and REMIC II Regular Interest A-S shall be reduced sequentially, in that order, in each case, until such excess (other than any portion thereof that exists because of the reimbursement of Workout-Delayed Reimbursement Amounts (from the principal portion of P&I Advances and/or payments or other collections of principal on the Mortgage Pool pursuant to subsection (II)(iii) of Section 3.05(a)) during the preceding Collection Period) or the related Uncertificated Principal Balance is reduced to zero (whichever occurs first).  If, after the foregoing reductions, the amount described in clause (i) of the second preceding sentence still exceeds the amount described in clause (ii) of such sentence, then, except to the extent that such excess exists because of the reimbursement of Workout-Delayed Reimbursement Amounts (from the principal portion of P&I Advances and/or payments or other collections of principal on the Mortgage Pool pursuant to subsection (II)(iii) of Section 3.05(a)) during the preceding Collection Period, the Uncertificated Principal Balances of the REMIC II Regular Interest that are the Corresponding REMIC II Regular Interest with respect to the Class A-1, Class A-2, Class A-3, Class A-4, Class A-5 and Class A-SB Certificates shall be reduced on a pro rata basis, as among such individual Corresponding REMIC II Regular Interests, in accordance with their Uncertificated Principal Balances, until any such remaining excess is reduced to zero.  All reductions in the Uncertificated Principal Balances of the







 respective REMIC II Regular Interests under this subsection (b) shall be deemed to constitute allocations of Realized Losses and Additional Trust Fund Expenses.



 (c) On each Distribution Date, if, following the deemed distributions to be made in respect of the REMIC I Regular Interests pursuant to Section 4.01(j), the Uncertificated Principal Balance of any REMIC I Regular Interest, in each case after taking account of such deemed distributions, exceeds the Stated Principal Balance of the related Mortgage Loan or REO Mortgage Loan (or, if such REMIC I Regular Interest relates to multiple Replacement Mortgage Loans, the aggregate Stated Principal Balance of the related Mortgage Loans and/or REO Mortgage Loans), as the case may be, that will be outstanding immediately following such Distribution Date, then, except to the extent that such excess exists (taking account of the provisions of the next succeeding sentence) because of the reimbursement of Workout-Delayed Reimbursement Amounts (from the principal portion of P&I Advances and/or payments or other collections of principal on the Mortgage Pool pursuant to subsection (II)(iii) of Section 3.05(a)) during the preceding Collection Period, the Uncertificated Principal Balance of such REMIC I Regular Interest shall be reduced to equal such Stated Principal Balance of such related Mortgage Loan or REO Mortgage Loan (or, if such REMIC I Regular Interest relates to multiple Replacement Mortgage Loans, the aggregate Stated Principal Balance of the related Mortgage Loans and/or REO Mortgage Loans), as the case may be, that will be outstanding immediately following such Distribution Date.  For purposes of the immediately preceding sentence, the aggregate amount excluded from the aggregate reductions of the Uncertificated Principal Balances of the REMIC I Regular Interests collectively shall equal the amount excluded from the reductions of the Uncertificated Principal Balances of the REMIC II Regular Interests pursuant to subsection (b) and such aggregate exclusion amount shall be deemed to be allocated among the REMIC I Regular Interests pro rata according to their Stated Principal Balances that, in the absence of such any and all such exclusions, would have been outstanding immediately after such Distribution Date by operation of the immediately preceding sentence.  Any reductions in the Uncertificated Principal Balances of the respective REMIC I Regular Interests under this subsection (c) shall be deemed to constitute allocations of Realized Losses and Additional Trust Fund Expenses.



 Section 4.05 Allocation of Certain Trust Advisor Expenses.



 (a) On each Distribution Date, immediately prior to the distributions to be made to the Regular Certificates and the Class A-S, Class B and Class C Regular Interests for such Distribution Date pursuant to Section 4.01(a), the Certificate Administrator shall allocate Trust Advisor Expenses (other than Designated Trust Advisor Expenses) to reduce the Unadjusted Distributable Certificate Interest for such Distribution Date for the Class D Certificates, the Class C Regular Interest and the Class B Regular Interest, in that order, in each case, until the Unadjusted Distributable Certificate Interest of the Class D Certificates or the Class C Regular Interest or the Class B Regular Interest for such Distribution Date has been reduced to zero.  Trust Advisor Expenses (other than Designated Trust Advisor Expenses) shall not be allocated to reduce interest distributable on the Class A Certificates, the Class A-S Regular Interest, the Interest Only Certificates or the Control-Eligible Certificates or the Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loans.







 To the extent that the amount of Trust Advisor Expenses (other than Designated Trust Advisor Expenses) payable with respect to any Distribution Date is greater than the aggregate amount of Unadjusted Distributable Certificate Interest otherwise distributable to the Class B and Class C Regular Interests and the Class D Certificates for such Distribution Date, the resulting Excess Trust Advisor Expenses (other than Designated Trust Advisor Expenses) shall be allocated to reduce the Principal Distribution Amount otherwise allocable to the Principal Balance Certificates that are not Control-Eligible Certificates for such Distribution Date.  Such Excess Trust Advisor Expenses (other than Designated Trust Advisor Expenses) shall reduce the Principal Distribution Amount for the Principal Balance Certificates that are not Control-Eligible Certificates for such Distribution Date, and shall be allocated to reduce the Certificate Principal Balances of such Certificates in the following order:  to the Class D Certificates, and then to the Class C, Class B and Class A-S Regular Interests, in each case, until the remaining Certificate Principal Balance of the Class D Certificates or the Class C, Class B or Class A-S Regular Interest has been reduced to zero.  Following the reduction of the Certificate Principal Balances of the Class D Certificates and the Class C, Class B and Class A-S Regular Interests to zero, the Certificate Administrator shall allocate any remaining Excess Trust Advisor Expenses (other than Designated Trust Advisor Expenses) among the Class A-1, Class A-2, Class A-3, Class A-4, Class A-5 and Class A-SB Certificates, pro rata (based upon their respective Certificate Principal Balances), until the remaining Certificate Principal Balances of the Class A-1, Class A-2, Class A-3, Class A-4, Class A-5 and Class A-SB Certificates have been reduced to zero.  Any Excess Trust Advisor Expenses allocated to the Class C, Class B or Class A-S Regular Interest for any Distribution Date pursuant to this Section 4.05(a) shall be allocated (i) in the case of the Class C Regular Interest, between the Class C Certificates and Class C-PEX Component in accordance with the Class C Percentage Interest for such Distribution Date and the Class C-PEX Percentage Interest for such Distribution Date, respectively, (ii) in the case of the Class B Regular Interest, between the Class B Certificates and Class B-PEX Component in accordance with the Class B Percentage Interest for such Distribution Date and the Class B-PEX Percentage Interest for such Distribution Date, respectively and (iii) in the case of the Class A-S Regular Interest, between the Class A-S Certificates and Class A-S-PEX Component in accordance with the Class A-S Percentage Interest for such Distribution Date and the Class A-S-PEX Percentage Interest for such Distribution Date, respectively.



 Any Trust Advisor Expenses (other than Designated Trust Advisor Expenses) or Excess Trust Advisor Expenses (other than Designated Trust Advisor Expenses) allocated to a Class of Certificates (which are not Control-Eligible Certificates) shall be allocated among the respective Certificates of such Class in proportion to the Percentage Interests evidenced by the respective Certificates.  If amounts distributable in respect of the Unadjusted Distributable Certificate Interest to the Class B and Class C Regular Interests and the Class D Certificates and otherwise available as the indicated portion of the Principal Distribution Amount are insufficient to reimburse any related Trust Advisor Expenses (other than Designated Trust Advisor Expenses) on a Distribution Date, any unreimbursed Trust Advisor Expenses (other than Designated Trust Advisor Expenses) shall remain unreimbursed until the next Distribution Date that such applicable amounts are available.  In no event shall any Trust Advisor Expenses other than Designated Trust Advisor Expenses reduce or delay any principal or interest payable in respect of the Control-Eligible Certificates.







 (b) On any Distribution Date, the amount reimbursable to the Trust Advisor in respect of Trust Advisor Expenses (other than Designated Trust Advisor Expenses) for such Distribution Date shall not exceed the sum of (i) the portion of the Principal Distribution Amount for such Distribution Date otherwise distributable to the Class A-1, Class A-2, Class A-3, Class A-4, Class A-5, Class A-SB and Class D Certificates and the Class A-S, Class B and Class C Regular Interests and (ii) the aggregate amount of Unadjusted Distributable Certificate Interest (for such purposes, calculated without regard to any reductions pursuant to clause (iv) of the definition of Unadjusted Distributable Certificate Interest as a result of Trust Advisor Expenses (other than Designated Trust Advisor Expenses) for such Distribution Date) that would otherwise be distributable to the Class B and Class C Regular Interests and the Class D Certificates for such Distribution Date. Any amount of Trust Advisor Expenses (other than Designated Trust Advisor Expenses) that are not reimbursed on a Distribution Date shall be payable on the next Distribution Date to the extent funds are sufficient, in accordance with Section 4.05(a), to make such payments.



 (c) To the extent that any actual recoveries of previously-incurred Trust Advisor Expenses (other than Designated Trust Advisor Expenses) are received from a source other than the proceeds of the related Mortgage Loan during the Collection Period related to any Distribution Date, such amounts shall be applied, first, as provided in Section 4.01(a) to reimburse the Holders of any Regular Certificates, the Class A-S Regular Interest (and therefore the Class A-S Certificates and Class A-S-PEX Component), the Class B Regular Interest (and therefore the Class B Certificates and Class B-PEX Component) and the Class C Regular Interest (and therefore the Class C Certificates and Class C-PEX Component) that suffered write-offs in connection with Trust Advisor Expenses, and any portion of such recovery remaining after such application shall be considered in the calculation of the Interest Distribution Amounts of the Class B Regular Interest, the Class C Regular Interest and the Class D Certificates, as and to the extent set forth in the definition of Interest Distribution Amount, for such Distribution Date (with the actual payment of such portion to be made to the Holders of the Class B and Class PEX Certificates in respect of the Class B Regular Interest, the Class C and Class PEX Certificates in respect of Class C Regular Interest and/or Class D Certificates to the extent required under the combined operation of the definition of Interest Distribution Amount and the provisions of Section 4.01(a) other than the final paragraph of Section 4.01(a)).

No Certificate shall be entitled to any benefit under this Agreement, or be valid for any purpose, however, unless there appears on such Certificate a certificate of authentication substantially in the form provided for herein executed by the Authenticating Agent by manual signature, and such certificate of authentication upon any Certificate shall be conclusive evidence, and the only evidence, that such Certificate has been duly authenticated and delivered hereunder.  All Certificates shall be dated the date of their authentication.



 Section 5.02 Registration of Transfer and Exchange of Certificates.



 (a) At all times during the term of this Agreement, there shall be maintained at the office of the Certificate Registrar a Certificate Register in which, subject to such







 reasonable regulations as the Certificate Registrar may prescribe, the Certificate Registrar shall provide for the registration of Certificates and of transfers and exchanges of Certificates as herein provided.  The Certificate Administrator is hereby initially appointed (and hereby agrees to act in accordance with the terms hereof) as Certificate Registrar for the purpose of registering Certificates and transfers and exchanges of Certificates as herein provided.  The Certificate Registrar may appoint, by a written instrument delivered to the Trustee, the Depositor, the Master Servicers, the Special Servicers and (if the Certificate Administrator is not the Certificate Registrar) the Certificate Administrator, any other bank or trust company to act as Certificate Registrar under such conditions as the predecessor Certificate Registrar may prescribe, provided that the predecessor Certificate Registrar shall not be relieved of any of its duties or responsibilities hereunder by reason of such appointment.  If the Certificate Administrator resigns or is removed in accordance with the terms hereof, the successor certificate administrator shall immediately succeed to its duties as Certificate Registrar.  The Depositor, the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator (if it is not the Certificate Registrar), the Master Servicers and the Special Servicers shall each have the right to inspect the Certificate Register or to obtain a copy thereof at all reasonable times, and to rely conclusively upon a certificate of the Certificate Registrar as to the information set forth in the Certificate Register.



 If three or more Holders make written request to the Certificate Registrar, and such request states that such Holders desire to communicate with other Holders with respect to their rights under this Agreement or under the Certificates and is accompanied by a copy of the communication which such Holders propose to transmit, then the Certificate Registrar shall, within thirty (30) days after the receipt of such request, afford (or cause any other Certificate Registrar to afford) the requesting Holders access during normal business hours to the most recent list of Certificateholders held by the Certificate Registrar.



 (b) No Transfer of any Non-Registered Certificate or interest therein shall be made unless that Transfer is exempt from the registration and/or qualification requirements of the Securities Act and any applicable securities or blue sky laws of any state or other jurisdiction within the United States, its territories and possessions, or is otherwise made in accordance with the Securities Act and such other securities or blue sky laws.  If offers and sales of any Certificate are made in any jurisdiction outside of the United States, its territories and possessions, the Person making such offers and sales must comply with all applicable laws of such jurisdiction.



 If a Transfer of any Definitive Non-Registered Certificate is to be made without registration under the Securities Act (other than in connection with the initial issuance of the Non-Registered Certificates or a Transfer of such Certificate by the Depositor, any Underwriter or any of their respective Affiliates or, in the case of a Global Certificate for any Class of Book-Entry Non-Registered Certificates, a Transfer thereof to a successor Depository or to the applicable Certificate Owner(s) in accordance with Section 5.03), then the Certificate Registrar shall refuse to register such Transfer unless it receives (and, upon receipt, may conclusively rely upon) either:  (i) a certificate from the Certificateholder desiring to effect such Transfer substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit C-1A and a certificate from such Certificateholder's prospective Transferee substantially in the form attached hereto either as Exhibit C-1B or as Exhibit C-2B (except that, in the case of any proposed transfer of a Class R Certificate, such prospective Transferee may provide a certificate substantially in the form







 attached hereto as Exhibit C-2B only); or (ii) an Opinion of Counsel satisfactory to the Certificate Administrator to the effect that such prospective Transferee is an Institutional Accredited Investor or a Qualified Institutional Buyer (except that, in the case of any proposed transfer of a Class R Certificate, such Opinion of Counsel must be to the effect that such prospective Transferee is a Qualified Institutional Buyer) and such Transfer may be made without registration under the Securities Act (which Opinion of Counsel shall not be an expense of the Trust Fund or of the Depositor, the Master Servicers, the Special Servicers, the Tax Administrator, the Certificate Administrator, the Trustee, the Custodian or the Certificate Registrar in their respective capacities as such), together with the written certification(s) as to the facts surrounding such Transfer from the Certificateholder desiring to effect such Transfer and/or such Certificateholder's prospective Transferee on which such Opinion of Counsel is based.



 If a Transfer of any interest in the Rule 144A Global Certificate for any Class of Book-Entry Non-Registered Certificates is to be made without registration under the Securities Act (other than in connection with the initial issuance of the Book-Entry Non-Registered Certificates or a Transfer of any interest therein by the Depositor, any Underwriter or any of their respective Affiliates), then the Certificate Owner desiring to effect such Transfer shall be required to obtain either (i) a certificate from such Certificate Owner's prospective Transferee substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit C-2B, or (ii) an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that the prospective Transferee is a Qualified Institutional Buyer, and that such Transfer may be made without registration under the Securities Act.  Except as provided in the following two paragraphs, no interest in the Rule 144A Global Certificate for any Class of Book-Entry Non-Registered Certificates shall be transferred to any Person who takes delivery other than in the form of an interest in such Rule 144A Global Certificate.  If any Transferee of an interest in the Rule 144A Global Certificate for any Class of Book-Entry Non-Registered Certificates does not, in connection with the subject Transfer, deliver to the Transferor the Opinion of Counsel or the certification described in the preceding sentence, then such Transferee shall be deemed to have represented and warranted that all the certifications set forth in Exhibit C-2B hereto are, with respect to the subject Transfer, true and correct.



 Notwithstanding the preceding paragraph, any interest in the Rule 144A Global Certificate for a Class of Book-Entry Non-Registered Certificates may be transferred (without delivery of any certificate or Opinion of Counsel described in clauses (i) and (ii) of the first sentence of the preceding paragraph) by the Depositor, any Affiliate of the Depositor or any Person designated in writing by the Depositor to any Person who takes delivery in the form of a beneficial interest in the Regulation S Global Certificate for such Class of Certificates upon delivery to the Certificate Registrar of (x) a certificate to the effect that the Certificate Owner desiring to effect such Transfer is the Depositor or an Affiliate of the Depositor and (y) such written orders and instructions as are required under the applicable procedures of the Depository, Clearstream and Euroclear to direct the Certificate Administrator to debit the account of a Depository Participant by a denomination of interests in such Rule 144A Global Certificate, and credit the account of a Depository Participant by a denomination of interests in such Regulation S Global Certificate, that is equal to the denomination of beneficial interests in the Book-Entry Non-Registered Certificates to be transferred.  Upon delivery to the Certificate Registrar of such certification and such orders and instructions, the Certificate Administrator, subject to and in accordance with the applicable procedures of the Depository, shall reduce the denomination of the Rule 144A Global Certificate in respect of the applicable Class of







 Book-Entry Non-Registered Certificates and increase the denomination of the Regulation S Global Certificate for such Class, by the denomination of the beneficial interest in such Class specified in such orders and instructions.



 Also notwithstanding the foregoing, any interest in a Rule 144A Global Certificate with respect to any Class of Book-Entry Non-Registered Certificates may be transferred by any Certificate Owner holding such interest to any Institutional Accredited Investor (other than a Qualified Institutional Buyer) that takes delivery in the form of a Definitive Certificate of the same Class as such Rule 144A Global Certificate upon delivery to the Certificate Registrar and the Certificate Administrator of (i) such certifications and/or opinions as are contemplated by the second paragraph of this Section 5.02(b) and (ii) such written orders and instructions as are required under the applicable procedures of the Depository to direct the Certificate Administrator to debit the account of a Depository Participant by the denomination of the transferred interests in such Rule 144A Global Certificate.  Upon delivery to the Certificate Registrar of the certifications and/or opinions contemplated by the second paragraph of this Section 5.02(b), the Certificate Administrator, subject to and in accordance with the applicable procedures of the Depository, shall reduce the denomination of the subject Rule 144A Global Certificate by the denomination of the transferred interests in such Rule 144A Global Certificate, and shall cause a Definitive Certificate of the same Class as such Rule 144A Global Certificate, and in a denomination equal to the reduction in the denomination of such Rule 144A Global Certificate, to be executed, authenticated and delivered in accordance with this Agreement to the applicable Transferee.  Correspondingly, any interest in a Non-Registered Certificate (other than a Class V or Class R Certificate) held as a Definitive Certificate may be transferred by any Certificateholder holding such interest to any Qualified Institutional Buyer that takes delivery in the form of a beneficial interest in a Rule 144A Global Certificate upon delivery to the Certificate Registrar and the Certificate Administrator of (i) a certificate from the Certificateholder desiring to effect such Transfer substantially in the form of attached hereto as Exhibit C-2A and a certificate from such Certificateholder's prospective Transferee substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit C-2B and (ii) such written orders and instructions as are required under the applicable procedures of the Depository to direct the Certificate Administrator to credit the account of a Depository Participant by the denomination of the transferred interests in such Rule 144A Global Certificate.  Upon surrender of the Definitive Certificate, the Certificate Administrator, subject to and in accordance with the applicable procedures of the Depository, shall increase the denomination of the subject Rule 144A Global Certificate by the denomination of the surrendered Definitive Certificate.



 Except as provided in the next paragraph, no beneficial interest in the Regulation S Global Certificate for any Class of Book-Entry Non-Registered Certificates shall be transferred to any Person who takes delivery other than in the form of a beneficial interest in such Regulation S Global Certificate.  On and prior to the Release Date, each Certificate Owner desiring to effect any Transfer of an interest in the Regulation S Global Certificate for any Class of Book-Entry Non-Registered Certificates to another Person who takes delivery in the form of a beneficial interest in such Regulation S Global Certificate shall be required to obtain from such Certificate Owner's prospective Transferee a written certification substantially in the form set forth in Exhibit C-3B hereto certifying that such Transferee is not a United States Securities Person.  On or prior to the Release Date, beneficial interests in the Regulation S Global Certificate for each Class of Book-Entry Non-Registered Certificates may be held only through







 Euroclear or Clearstream.  The Regulation S Global Certificate for each Class of Book-Entry Non-Registered Certificates shall be deposited with the Certificate Administrator as custodian for the Depository and registered in the name of Cede & Co. as nominee of the Depository.



 Notwithstanding the preceding paragraph, after the Release Date, any interest in the Regulation S Global Certificate for a Class of Book-Entry Non-Registered Certificates may be transferred by a Certificate Owner to any Person who takes delivery in the form of a beneficial interest in the Rule 144A Global Certificate for such Class of Certificates upon delivery to the Certificate Registrar and the Certificate Administrator of (x) a certificate from the Certificate Owner desiring to effect such Transfer substantially in the form of attached hereto as Exhibit C-2A and a certificate from such Certificate Owner's prospective Transferee substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit C-2B and (y) such written orders and instructions as are required under the applicable procedures of the Depository, Clearstream and Euroclear to direct the Certificate Administrator to debit the account of a Depository Participant by a denomination of interests in such Regulation S Global Certificate, and credit the account of a Depository Participant by a denomination of interests in such Rule 144A Global Certificate, that is equal to the denomination of beneficial interests in such Class of Book-Entry Non-Registered Certificates to be transferred.  Upon delivery to the Certificate Registrar and the Certificate Administrator of such certification and orders and instructions, the Certificate Administrator, subject to and in accordance with the applicable procedures of the Depository, shall reduce the denomination of the Regulation S Global Certificate in respect of such Class of Book-Entry Non-Registered Certificates, and increase the denomination of the Rule 144A Global Certificate for such Class, by the denomination of the beneficial interest in such Class specified in such orders and instructions.



 None of the Depositor, the Underwriters, the Certificate Administrator, the Trustee, the Master Servicers, the Special Servicers, the Trust Advisor, the Tax Administrator or the Certificate Registrar is obligated to register or qualify any Class of Non-Registered Certificates under the Securities Act or any other securities law or to take any action not otherwise required under this Agreement to permit the Transfer of any Non-Registered Certificate or interest therein without registration or qualification.  Any Certificateholder or Certificate Owner desiring to effect a Transfer of any Non-Registered Certificate or interest therein shall, and does hereby agree to, indemnify the Depositor, the Underwriters, the Certificate Administrator, the Trust Advisor, the Trustee, the Master Servicers, the Special Servicers, the Tax Administrator and the Certificate Registrar against any liability that may result if such Transfer is not exempt from the registration and/or qualification requirements of the Securities Act and any applicable state or foreign securities laws or is not made in accordance with such federal, state or foreign laws.



 (c) No Transfer of a Certificate or any interest therein shall be made (A) to any Plan or (B) to any Person who is directly or indirectly purchasing such Certificate or interest therein on behalf of, as named fiduciary of, as trustee of, or with assets of a Plan, if the purchase and holding of such Certificate or interest therein by the prospective Transferee would result in a violation of Section 406 or 407 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, or a similar violation under Similar Law, or would result in the imposition of an excise tax under Section 4975 of the Code.  Except in connection with the initial issuance of the Non-Registered Certificates or any Transfer of a Non-Registered Certificate or any interest therein by the Depositor, any







 Underwriter or any of their respective Affiliates or, in the case of a Global Certificate for any Class of Book-Entry Non-Registered Certificates, any Transfer thereof to a successor Depository or to the applicable Certificate Owner(s) in accordance with Section 5.03, the Certificate Registrar shall refuse to register the Transfer of a Definitive Non-Registered Certificate unless it has received from the prospective Transferee, and any Certificate Owner transferring an interest in a Global Certificate for any Class of Book-Entry Non-Registered Certificates shall be required to obtain from its prospective Transferee, either (i) a certification to the effect that such prospective Transferee is not a Plan and is not directly or indirectly purchasing such Certificate or interest therein on behalf of, as named fiduciary of, as trustee of, or with assets of a Plan; or (ii) alternatively, but only in the case of a Certificate that is not a Class R or Class V Certificate, a certification to the effect that the purchase and holding of such Certificate or interest therein by such prospective Transferee is exempt from the prohibited transaction provisions of Sections 406(a) and (b) and 407 of ERISA and the excise taxes imposed on such prohibited transactions by Sections 4975(a) and (b) of the Code, by reason of Sections I and III of PTCE 95-60; or (iii) alternatively, but only in the case of a Non-Registered Certificate that is an Investment Grade Certificate (other than, if applicable, a Class R or Class V Certificate), determined at date of acquisition, that is being acquired by or on behalf of a Plan in reliance on the Exemption, a certification to the effect that such Plan (X) is an "accredited investor" as defined in Rule 501(a)(1) of Regulation D under the Securities Act, (Y) is not sponsored (within the meaning of Section 3(16)(B) of ERISA) by any member of the Restricted Group, and (Z) agrees that it will obtain from each of its Transferees a written certification described in clause (i) above, a written certification described in clause (ii) above or a written representation that such Transferee satisfies the requirements of the immediately preceding clauses (iii)(X) and (iii)(Y), together with a written agreement that such Transferee will obtain from each of its Transferees a similar written certification or representation.  It is hereby acknowledged that the forms of certification attached hereto as Exhibit D-1 (in the case of Definitive Non-Registered Certificates) and Exhibit D-2 (in the case of ownership interests in Book-Entry Non-Registered Certificates) are acceptable for purposes of the preceding sentence.  In lieu of one of the foregoing certifications, a prospective Transferee may deliver to the Certificate Registrar a certification of facts and an Opinion of Counsel which establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Trustee that such Transfer will not result in a violation of Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, or a similar violation under Similar Law, or result in the imposition of an excise tax under Section 4975 of the Code, and will not subject the Trustee, the Depositor, the Certificate Administrator, the Master Servicers, the Special Servicers, the Certificate Registrar, the initial purchasers or a Sub-Servicer to any obligation in addition to those undertaken in this Agreement; in the case of an ownership interest in a Book-Entry Certificate, the prospective Transferee shall also deliver to the Certificate Owner from whom it is acquiring the interest a copy of such certification of facts and Opinion of Counsel, and a certification that these documents have been delivered to the Certificate Registrar.  If any Transferee of a Certificate (including a Registered Certificate) or any interest therein does not, in connection with the subject Transfer, deliver to the Certificate Registrar (in the case of a Definitive Certificate) or the Transferor (in the case of ownership interests in a Book-Entry Non-Registered Certificate) any certification and/or Opinion of Counsel contemplated by the second preceding sentence, then such Transferee shall be deemed to have represented and warranted that either:  (i) such Transferee is not a Plan and is not directly or indirectly purchasing such Certificate or interest therein on behalf of, as named fiduciary of, as trustee of, or with assets of a Plan; or (ii) the







 purchase and holding of such Certificate or interest therein by such Transferee are exempt from the prohibited transaction provisions of Sections 406(a) and (b) and 407 of ERISA and the excise taxes imposed on such prohibited transactions by Sections 4975(a) and (b) of the Code by reason of the Exemption (in the case of such a Certificate that is an Investment Grade Certificate) or by reason of Sections I and III of PTCE 95-60 (in the case of such a Certificate that is not an Investment Grade Certificate) or, in the case of a Plan subject to Similar Law does not result in a violation of Similar Law.



 (d) (i)  Each Person who has or who acquires any Ownership Interest in a Class R Certificate shall be deemed by the acceptance or acquisition of such Ownership Interest to have agreed to be bound by the following provisions and to have irrevocably authorized the Certificate Administrator under clause (ii)(A) below to deliver payments to a Person other than such Person and to have irrevocably authorized the Certificate Administrator under clause (ii)(B) below to negotiate the terms of any mandatory disposition and to execute all instruments of Transfer and to do all other things necessary in connection with any such disposition.  The rights of each Person acquiring any Ownership Interest in a Class R Certificate are expressly subject to the following provisions:



 (A) Each Person holding or acquiring any Ownership Interest in a Class R Certificate shall be a Permitted Transferee and shall promptly notify the Tax Administrator and the Certificate Administrator of any change or impending change in its status as a Permitted Transferee.



 (B) In connection with any proposed Transfer of any Ownership Interest in a Class R Certificate, the Certificate Registrar shall require delivery to it, and shall not register the Transfer of any Class R Certificate until its receipt, of an affidavit and agreement substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit E-1 (a "Transfer Affidavit and Agreement"), from the proposed Transferee, representing and warranting, among other things, that such Transferee is a Permitted Transferee, that it is not acquiring its Ownership Interest in the Class R Certificate that is the subject of the proposed Transfer as a nominee, trustee or agent for any Person that is not a Permitted Transferee.



 (C) Notwithstanding the delivery of a Transfer Affidavit and Agreement by a proposed Transferee under clause (B) above, if a Responsible Officer of either the Certificate Administrator or the Certificate Registrar has actual knowledge that the proposed Transferee is not a Permitted Transferee, no Transfer of an Ownership Interest in a Class R Certificate to such proposed Transferee shall be effected.



 (D) Each Person holding or acquiring any Ownership Interest in a Class R Certificate shall agree (1) to require a Transfer Affidavit and Agreement from any prospective Transferee to whom such Person attempts to Transfer its Ownership Interest in such Class R Certificate and (2) not to Transfer its Ownership Interest in such Class R Certificate unless it provides to the Certificate Registrar a certificate substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit E-2







 stating that, among other things, it has no actual knowledge that such prospective Transferee is not a Permitted Transferee.



 (E) Each Person holding or acquiring an Ownership Interest in a Class R Certificate, by purchasing such Ownership Interest, agrees to give the Tax Administrator and the Certificate Administrator written notice that it is a "pass-through interest holder" within the meaning of temporary Treasury Regulations Section 1.67-3T(a)(2)(i)(A) immediately upon acquiring an Ownership Interest in a Class R Certificate, if it is, or is holding an Ownership Interest in a Class R Certificate on behalf of, a "pass-through interest holder."



 (ii) (A)  If any purported Transferee shall become a Holder of a Class R Certificate in violation of the provisions of this Section 5.02(d), then the last preceding Holder of such Class R Certificate that was in compliance with the provisions of this Section 5.02(d) shall be restored, to the extent permitted by law, to all rights as Holder thereof retroactive to the date of registration of such Transfer of such Class R Certificate.  None of the Depositor, the Certificate Administrator, the Trustee or the Certificate Registrar shall be under any liability to any Person for any registration of Transfer of a Class R Certificate that is in fact not permitted by this Section 5.02(d) or for making any payments due on such Certificate to the Holder thereof or for taking any other action with respect to such Holder under the provisions of this Agreement.



 (B) If any purported Transferee shall become a Holder of a Class R Certificate in violation of the restrictions in this Section 5.02(d), then, to the extent that retroactive restoration of the rights of the preceding Holder of such Class R Certificate as described in clause (ii)(A) above shall be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the Certificate Administrator shall have the right, but not the obligation, to cause the Transfer of such Class R Certificate to a Permitted Transferee selected by the Certificate Administrator on such terms as the Certificate Administrator may choose, and the Certificate Administrator shall not be liable to any Person having an Ownership Interest in such Class R Certificate as a result of the Certificate Administrator's exercise of such discretion.  Such purported Transferee shall promptly endorse and deliver such Class R Certificate in accordance with the instructions of the Certificate Administrator.  Such Permitted Transferee may be the Certificate Administrator itself or any Affiliate of the Certificate Administrator.



 (iii) The Tax Administrator shall make available to the IRS and to those Persons specified by the REMIC Provisions all information furnished to it by the other parties hereto necessary to compute any tax imposed (A) as a result of the Transfer of an Ownership Interest in a Class R Certificate to any Person who is a Disqualified Organization, including the information described in Treasury Regulations Sections 1.860D-1(b)(5) and 1.860E-2(a)(5) with respect to the "excess inclusions" of such Class R Certificate and (B) as a result of any regulated investment company, real estate investment trust, common trust fund, partnership, trust, estate or organization described in Section 1381 of the Code that holds an Ownership Interest in a Class R Certificate having as among its record holders at any time any Person which is a







 Disqualified Organization, and each of the other parties hereto shall furnish to the Tax Administrator all information in its possession necessary for the Tax Administrator to discharge such obligation.  The Person holding such Ownership Interest shall be responsible for the reasonable compensation of the Tax Administrator for providing information thereto pursuant to this subsection (d)(iii) and Section 10.01(d)(i).



 (iv) The provisions of this Section 5.02(d) set forth prior to this clause (iv) may be modified, added to or eliminated, provided that there shall have been delivered to the Certificate Administrator and the Tax Administrator the following:



 (A) A Rating Agency Confirmation with respect to such modification of, addition to or elimination of such provisions; and



 (B) an Opinion of Counsel, in form and substance satisfactory to the Certificate Administrator and the Tax Administrator, obtained at the expense of the party seeking such modification of, addition to or elimination of such provisions (but in no event at the expense of the Trustee, the Tax Administrator or the Trust), to the effect that doing so will not (1) cause any REMIC Pool to cease to qualify as a REMIC or be subject to an entity level tax caused by the Transfer of any Class R Certificate to a Person which is not a Permitted Transferee or (2) cause a Person other than the prospective Transferee to be subject to a REMIC-related tax caused by the Transfer of a Class R Certificate to a Person that is not a Permitted Transferee.



 (e) If a Person is acquiring any Non-Registered Certificate or interest therein as a fiduciary or agent for one or more accounts, such Person shall be required to deliver to the Certificate Registrar (or, in the case of an interest in a Book-Entry Non-Registered Certificate, to the Certificate Owner that is transferring such interest) a certification to the effect that, and such other evidence as may be reasonably required by the Certificate Administrator (or such Certificate Owner) to confirm that, it has (i) sole investment discretion with respect to each such account and (ii) full power to make the applicable foregoing acknowledgments, representations, warranties, certifications and agreements with respect to each such account as set forth in subsections (b), (c) and/or (d), as appropriate, of this Section 5.02.



 (f) Subject to the preceding provisions of this Section 5.02, upon surrender for registration of transfer of any Certificate at the offices of the Certificate Registrar maintained for such purpose, the Certificate Registrar shall execute and the Authenticating Agent shall authenticate and deliver, in the name of the designated transferee or transferees, one or more new Certificates of the same Class in authorized denominations evidencing a like aggregate Percentage Interest in such Class.



 (g) At the option of any Holder, its Certificates may be exchanged for other Certificates of authorized denominations of the same Class evidencing a like aggregate Percentage Interest in such Class upon surrender of the Certificates to be exchanged at the offices of the Certificate Registrar maintained for such purpose.  Whenever any Certificates are so surrendered for exchange, the Certificate Registrar shall execute and the Authenticating Agent







 shall authenticate and deliver the Certificates which the Certificateholder making the exchange is entitled to receive.



 (h) Every Certificate presented or surrendered for transfer or exchange shall (if so required by the Certificate Registrar) be duly endorsed by, or be accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in the form satisfactory to the Certificate Registrar duly executed by, the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing.



 (i) No service charge shall be imposed for any transfer or exchange of Certificates, but the Certificate Administrator or Certificate Registrar may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any transfer or exchange of Certificates.



 (j) All Certificates surrendered for transfer and exchange shall be physically canceled by the Certificate Registrar, and the Certificate Registrar shall dispose of such canceled Certificates in accordance with its standard procedures.

 (b) The Certificate Administrator, the Master Servicers, the Special Servicers, the Trustee, the Depositor and the Certificate Registrar may for all purposes, including the making of payments due on the Book-Entry Certificates, deal with the Depository as the authorized representative of the Certificate Owners with respect to such Certificates for the purposes of exercising the rights of Certificateholders hereunder.

 Exhibit K-1 hereto (or such other form as shall be reasonably acceptable to the Certificate Administrator) and shall, to the extent required by the Certificate Administrator, specify the Class and Certificate Principal Balance or Certificate Notional Amount, as the case may be, of the Book-Entry Certificate beneficially owned; provided, that none of the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator or the Certificate Registrar shall knowingly recognize such Person as a Certificate Owner if such Person, to the actual knowledge of a Responsible Officer of the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator or the Certificate Registrar, as the case may be, acquired its Ownership Interest in a Book-Entry Certificate in violation of Section 5.02(c), or if such Person's certification that it is a Certificate Owner is in direct conflict with information actually known by a Responsible Officer of the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator or the Certificate Registrar, with respect to the identity of a Certificate Owner.  The Trustee, the Certificate Administrator and the Certificate Registrar shall each exercise its reasonable discretion in making any determination under this Section 5.06 and shall afford any Person providing information with respect to its beneficial ownership of any Book-Entry Certificate an opportunity to resolve any discrepancies between the information provided and any other information available to the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator or the Certificate Registrar, as the case may be.



 Section 5.07 Appointment of Authenticating Agents.



 (a) The Certificate Administrator may appoint at its expense an Authenticating Agent, which shall be authorized to act on behalf of the Certificate Administrator in authenticating Certificates.

Each Authenticating Agent shall be subject to the same obligations, standard of care, protection and indemnities as would be imposed on, or would protect, the Certificate Administrator hereunder.  The appointment of an Authenticating Agent shall not relieve the Certificate Administrator from any of its obligations hereunder, and the Certificate Administrator shall remain responsible for all acts and omissions of the Authenticating Agent.  In the absence of any other Person appointed in accordance herewith acting as Authenticating Agent, the Certificate Administrator hereby agrees to act in such capacity in accordance with the terms hereof.  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if the Certificate Administrator is no longer the Authenticating Agent, any provision or requirement herein requiring notice or any information or documentation to be provided to the Authenticating Agent shall be construed to require that such notice, information or documentation also be provided to the Certificate Administrator.



 (b) Any Person into which any Authenticating Agent may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any Person resulting from any merger, conversion, or consolidation to which any Authenticating Agent shall be a party, or any Person succeeding to the corporate agency business of any Authenticating Agent, shall continue to be the Authenticating Agent without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator or the Authenticating Agent.







 (c) Any Authenticating Agent appointed in accordance with this Section 5.07 may at any time resign by giving at least thirty (30) days' advance written notice of resignation to the Certificate Administrator, the Trustee, the Certificate Registrar and the Depositor.  The Certificate Administrator may at any time terminate the agency of any Authenticating Agent appointed in accordance with this Section 5.07 by giving written notice of termination to such Authenticating Agent, the Trustee, the Certificate Registrar and the Depositor.  Upon receiving a notice of such a resignation or upon such a termination, or in case at any time any Authenticating Agent shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section 5.07, the Certificate Administrator may appoint a successor Authenticating Agent, in which case the Certificate Administrator shall give written notice of such appointment to the Trustee, the Certificate Registrar and the Depositor and shall mail notice of such appointment to all Holders of Certificates; provided, that no successor Authenticating Agent shall be appointed unless eligible under the provisions of this Section 5.07.  Any successor Authenticating Agent upon acceptance of its appointment hereunder shall become vested with all the rights, powers, duties and responsibilities of its predecessor hereunder, with like effect as if originally named as Authenticating Agent.

In addition, the Depositor shall have the right to make or cause exchanges on the Closing Date pursuant to instructions delivered to the Certificate Administrator on the Closing Date.



 (b) In connection with any exchange of Exchangeable Certificates, the Certificate Registrar shall reduce the outstanding aggregate Class Principal Balance of such Class or Classes of Exchangeable Certificates surrendered by the applicable Holder on the Certificate Register and shall increase the outstanding Class Principal Balance of the related Class or Classes of Exchangeable Certificates received by such Holder in such exchange on the

Exchangeable Certificates shall be exchangeable on the books of the Depository for the corresponding Exchangeable Certificates on and after the Closing Date, by notice to the Certificate Administrator substantially in the form of Exhibit V attached hereto.



 (d) The Certificate Administrator shall make the first distribution on an Exchangeable Certificate received by a Certificateholder in any exchange on the Distribution Date in the month following the month of exchange to the Certificateholder of record as of the applicable Record Date for such Certificate and Distribution Date.  If an Exchange Date occurs in any month before the Distribution Date in such month, then any distributions to be made on such Distribution Date on any Certificates surrendered in the exchange shall be so made to the Certificateholder of record as of the applicable Record Date for such Certificates and such Distribution Date.  Neither the Certificate Administrator nor the Depositor will have any obligation to ensure the availability in the market of the applicable Certificates to accomplish any exchange.

The Depositor, the Trust Advisor, the Master Servicers, the Special Servicers and any director, member, manager, officer, employee or agent of any such party may rely in good faith on any document of any kind conforming to the requirements of this Agreement for the truth and accuracy of the contents of that document (and as to certificates and opinions, including Opinions of Counsel, for the truth of the statements made therein and the correctness of the opinions expressed therein) reasonably believed or in good faith believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties, which document, prima facie, is properly executed and submitted by any Person, or any employee or agent of any Person (including legal counsel as to opinions), respecting any matters arising hereunder.  The Depositor, the Trust Advisor, the Master Servicers, the Special Servicers (each in its capacity as such or in its individual capacity) and any member, manager, director, officer, employee or agent of any such party, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Trust Fund out of the Collection Accounts and the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Custodial Account, as applicable, as provided in Section 3.05(a), or the Distribution Account, as provided in Section 3.05(b), against any loss, liability, claim, damages, penalty, fine, cost or expense (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) incurred in connection with any actual or threatened legal action or claim relating to this Agreement, the Certificates or the Trust, other than any loss, liability, cost or expense:  (i) specifically required to be borne by such party, without right of reimbursement, pursuant to the terms hereof; (ii) incurred in connection with any legal action or claim against such party resulting from any breach of a representation or warranty made by such Person herein, or (iii) incurred in connection with any legal action or claim against such party resulting from any willful misfeasance, bad faith or negligence in the performance of such Person's obligations and duties hereunder or resulting from negligent disregard of such obligations and duties.

Any indemnification payments or reimbursements of costs or expenses described in the preceding paragraph to which the Trust Advisor may become entitled shall constitute Trust Advisor Expenses and the payment of such Trust Advisor Expenses (other than those that constitute Designated Trust Advisor Expenses) shall be subject to the limitations set forth in Section 4.05.  The Trust Advisor shall not be entitled to reimbursement of expenses for its services except those for which it is entitled to indemnification as described above.

Insofar as any such loss, liability, claim, damages, penalty, fine, cost or expense related to any Serviced Loan Combination is so paid by withdrawal from the Collection Accounts or Distribution Account and funds are subsequently received and allocable to the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan(s), then the applicable Master Servicer shall deposit the amount of such loss, liability, claim, damages, penalty, fine, cost or expense into the applicable Collection Account from such funds so received and allocable to the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan.



 (b) In addition, none of the Depositor, the Trust Advisor, the Master Servicers or the Special Servicers or any director, member, manager, officer, employee or agent of any such party shall have any liability with respect to, and each of the Depositor, the Trust Advisor, the Master Servicers, the Special Servicers and any director, member, manager, officer, employee or agent of any such party shall be entitled to rely, as to the truth of the statements made therein and the correctness of the opinions expressed therein, on any documents, certificates or opinions, including Opinions of Counsel, furnished to, and reasonably believed or in good faith believed by such Person to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties, which document, certificate or opinion, prima facie, is properly executed and submitted by any Person, or any employee or agent of any Person (including legal counsel as to opinions), respecting any matters arising hereunder.  Each of the Master Servicers, the Special Servicers and the Trust Advisor may rely in good faith on information provided to it by the other parties hereto (unless the provider and the recipient of such information are the same Person or Affiliates) and by the Borrowers and property managers, and will have no duty to investigate or verify the accuracy thereof.  Each of the Master Servicers, the Special Servicers and the Trust Advisor may rely, and shall be protected in acting or refraining from acting upon, any resolution, officer's certificate, certificate of auditors or any other certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, consent, order, financial statement, agreement, appraisal, bond or other document (in electronic or paper format) as contemplated by and in accordance with this Agreement and reasonably believed or in good faith believed by the applicable Master Servicer, the applicable Special Servicer or the Trust Advisor, or directors, members, officers, employees or agents of any such party as the case may be, to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties and each of them may consult with counsel, in which case any written advice of counsel or Opinion of Counsel shall be full and complete authorization and protection with respect to any action taken or suffered or omitted by it hereunder in good faith and in accordance with such advice or Opinion of Counsel.







 Furthermore, none of the Master Servicers, the Special Servicers and the Trust Advisor or directors, members, managers, officers, employees or agents of any such party shall have any liability under this Agreement for any failure of any other such Person (or any other party to this Agreement) to perform such Person's obligations or duties hereunder.



 Section 6.04 Resignation of a Master Servicer or a Special Servicer.



 (a) Each of the Master Servicers and the Special Servicers may resign from the obligations and duties hereby imposed on it, upon a determination that its duties hereunder are no longer permissible under applicable law or are in material conflict by reason of applicable law with any other activities carried on by it (the other activities of such Master Servicer or such Special Servicer, as the case may be, so causing such a conflict being of a type and nature carried on by such Master Servicer or such Special Servicer, as the case may be, at the date of this Agreement).  Any such determination requiring the resignation of that Master Servicer or that Special Servicer shall be evidenced by an Opinion of Counsel to such effect which shall be delivered to the Trustee, with a copy to the Certificate Administrator, the Subordinate Class Representative and the Majority Subordinate Certificateholder (and each affected Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder).  Unless applicable law requires the resignation of such Master Servicer or such Special Servicer (as the case may be) to be effective immediately, and the Opinion of Counsel delivered pursuant to the prior sentence so states, no such resignation shall become effective until the Trustee or other successor shall have assumed the responsibilities and obligations of the resigning party in accordance with Section 6.05 or Section 7.02 hereof; provided that, if no successor to such Master Servicer or such Special Servicer, as the case may be, shall have been so appointed and have accepted appointment within ninety (90) days after such Master Servicer or such Special Servicer, as the case may be, has given notice of such resignation, the resigning Master Servicer or Special Servicer, as the case may be, may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor thereto.



 (b) In addition, each of the Master Servicers and the Special Servicers shall have the right to resign at any other time, provided that (i) a willing successor thereto (including any such successor proposed by the resigning party) has been found that is, solely in the case of a successor to a Special Servicer if it is a resigning special servicer, acceptable to the Subordinate Class Representative (during any Subordinate Control Period), (ii) solely in the case of a Special Servicer if it is the resigning party, the resigning party has consulted with the Subordinate Class Representative (during any Collective Consultation Period) and the Trust Advisor (during any Collective Consultation Period or Senior Consultation Period) with respect to the identity and quality of its proposed successor, (iii) the succession is the subject of a Rating Agency Confirmation from each Rating Agency, (iv) the successor accepts appointment in writing prior to the effectiveness of such resignation and (v) the successor is not a Prohibited Party at the time of such succession unless the Depositor consents to the appointment in its reasonable discretion.



 (c) None of the Master Servicers or the Special Servicers shall be permitted to resign except as contemplated in subsections (a) and (b) of this Section 6.04.  Consistent with the foregoing, none of the Master Servicers or the Special Servicers shall (except in connection with any resignation thereby permitted above in this Section 6.04 or as otherwise expressly provided herein, including the provisions of Section 3.11(a), Section 3.22 and/or Section 6.02) assign or







 transfer any of its rights, benefits or privileges hereunder to any other Person or delegate to, subcontract with, or authorize or appoint any other Person to perform any of the duties, covenants or obligations to be performed by it hereunder.  If, pursuant to any provision hereof, the duties of a Master Servicer or a Special Servicer are transferred to a successor thereto, the entire amount of compensation payable to that Master Servicer or that Special Servicer, as the case may be, that accrues pursuant hereto from and after the date of such transfer shall be payable to such successor, except (in the case of the applicable Special Servicer) to the extent provided in Section 3.11(c).



 (d) Any successor Master Servicer or successor Special Servicer (including any successor Special Servicer appointed pursuant Section 6.05 hereof) shall, in connection with its appointment as successor Master Servicer or successor Special Servicer, (i) deliver to the Depositor and the Other Depositor related to an Other Securitization that includes a Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan, if applicable, the Form 8-K Disclosure Information required pursuant to Item 6.02 of the Form 8-K Current Report regarding itself in its role as successor Master Servicer or successor Special Servicer, as applicable, and (ii) enter into an indemnification agreement reasonably acceptable to the Depositor and such successor Master Servicer or successor Special Servicer, as applicable, pursuant to which the successor Master Servicer or successor Special Servicer, as applicable, agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Depositor, the Other Depositor, their respective directors and officers, and each other Person who controls any such entity within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, against any and all expenses, losses, claims, damages and other liabilities, including without limitation the costs of investigation, legal defense and any amounts paid in settlement of any claim or litigation arising out of (A) the failure of any such Form 8-K Disclosure Information, insofar as such information relates to or is applicable to such successor Master Servicer or successor Special Servicer (either in its individual capacity or its capacity as successor Master Servicer or successor Special Servicer under this Agreement), to satisfy the requirements of the applicable provisions of Regulation AB and (B) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in such Form 8-K Disclosure Information regarding itself in its role as successor Master Servicer or successor Special Servicer, as applicable, or any omission or alleged omission to state in such Form 8-K Disclosure Information regarding itself in its role as successor Master Servicer or successor Special Servicer, as applicable, a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.



 (e) The resigning Master Servicer or Special Servicer, as applicable, shall pay all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses of each party to this Agreement, the Trust and each Rating Agency in connection with the resignation of such party and the transfer of its duties (including, but not limited to, the costs of obtaining Rating Agency Confirmation and reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses associated with transferring Servicing Files to the successor).



 Section 6.05 Replacement of Special Servicers.



 (a) During any Subordinate Control Period, the Majority Subordinate Certificateholder, or the Subordinate Class Representative on its behalf, will have the right to terminate a Special Servicer, with or without cause, and appoint itself or an Affiliate thereof or







 another Person as the successor Special Servicer.  It shall be a condition to such appointment that the successor Special Servicer be a Qualified Replacement Special Servicer and the conditions set forth in subsection (e) be satisfied.



 (b) During any Collective Consultation Period or Senior Consultation Period, upon (i) the written direction of Holders of Principal Balance Certificates evidencing not less than 25% of the aggregate Voting Rights (taking into account the allocation of any Appraisal Reduction Amounts in respect of the Mortgage Loans to notionally reduce the Class Principal Balances of the Principal Balance Certificates to which such Appraisal Reduction Amounts are allocable) of all Certificates on an aggregate basis, requesting a vote to terminate the applicable Special Servicer and appoint a successor Special Servicer, (ii) payment by such Holders to the Certificate Administrator of the reasonable fees and expenses (including any fees and expenses of counsel or any Rating Agency) to be incurred by the Certificate Administrator in connection with administering such vote (which fees and expenses shall not be paid from the Trust Fund) and (iii) delivery by such Holders to the Certificate Administrator of a Rating Agency Confirmation with respect to such termination and appointment of a successor (to be obtained at the expenses solely of such Certificateholders) and the equivalent from each Rating Agency hired to provide ratings with respect to any commercial mortgage-backed securities backed by any Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan, the Certificate Administrator shall post such request on the Certificate Administrator's Website and conduct the solicitation of votes of all Certificates in such regard.  Upon the written direction of Holders of Principal Balance Certificates evidencing at least 75% of the aggregate Voting Rights (taking into account the allocation of any Appraisal Reduction Amounts in respect of the Mortgage Loans to notionally reduce the Class Principal Balances of the Principal Balance Certificates to which such Appraisal Reduction Amounts are allocable) of all Principal Balance Certificates on an aggregate basis, the Certificate Administrator shall terminate all of the rights and obligations of the Special Servicer under this Agreement and appoint the successor Special Servicer that was proposed by the Certificateholders requesting the vote.  Such termination and replacement shall be further conditioned on such successor Special Servicer being a Qualified Replacement Special Servicer and the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 6.05(e) to the extent that such conditions have not otherwise been satisfied.  Such termination shall also be subject to the terminated Special Servicer's rights to indemnification, payment of outstanding fees, reimbursement of Advances, and other rights set forth in this Agreement which survive termination.  If a proposed termination and replacement of the applicable Special Servicer by Certificateholders as described above is not consummated within 180 days following the initial request of the Certificateholders who requested a vote, then the proposed termination and replacement shall have no further force or effect (except that the Certificate Administrator shall be entitled to apply any amounts prepaid by such Certificateholders for expenses to pay any expenses incurred by the Certificate Administrator).



 (c) In addition, during any Senior Consultation Period, if the Trust Advisor determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that the applicable Special Servicer is not performing its duties under this Agreement in accordance with the Servicing Standard, the Trust Advisor will have the right to recommend the replacement of such Special Servicer.  In such event, the Trust Advisor shall deliver to the Trustee and the Certificate Administrator, with a copy to the then-current applicable Special Servicer, a written recommendation in electronic format and in the form of Exhibit O-3 attached hereto (which form may be modified or







 supplemented by the Trust Advisor from time to time to cure any ambiguity or error or to incorporate any additional information as it deems appropriate) detailing the reasons supporting its position and recommending a suggested replacement Special Servicer.  In addition, the Certificate Administrator shall post such recommendation on the Certificate Administrator's Website in accordance with Section 8.12(b), and by mail transmit such recommendation to, conduct the solicitation of votes of, the Holders of all Certificates, according to such procedures (including the establishment of a record date for voting) as it determines.  Such notice and solicitation shall state that the proposed replacement, if approved by the Certificateholders, shall be subject to satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 6.05(e) within 180 days following the initial recommendation of the Trust Advisor and that any approval granted by the requisite Certificateholders in the aggregate may not be revoked or withdrawn at any time.  The Trust Advisor's recommendation to replace a Special Servicer must be confirmed by an affirmative vote of Certificateholders having at least a majority of the aggregate Voting Rights (taking into account the allocation of any Appraisal Reduction Amounts in respect of the Mortgage Loans to notionally reduce the Class Principal Balances of the Principal Balance Certificates to which such Appraisal Reduction Amounts are allocable) of all Principal Balance Certificates on an aggregate basis.  In the event the Holders of such Principal Balance Certificates elect to remove and replace a Special Servicer, the Certificate Administrator shall notify the Trustee, the Trust Advisor and the then-current applicable Special Servicer, and the Certificate Administrator shall promptly request a Rating Agency Confirmation from each of the Rating Agencies with respect to the proposed removal and replacement, unless such Certificateholders themselves deliver such Rating Agency Confirmation.  In the event the Trustee and the Certificate Administrator receive a Rating Agency Confirmation from each of the Rating Agencies (and the successor Special Servicer agrees to be bound by the terms of this Agreement), the Trustee will then be required to terminate all of the rights and obligations of such Special Servicer under this Agreement and to appoint the successor Special Servicer that has been approved by the Certificateholders and constitutes a Qualified Replacement Special Servicer, and the Certificate Administrator shall post such notice on the Certificate Administrator's Website in accordance with Section 8.12(b).  Any such termination of an existing Special Servicer will be subject to the terminated Special Servicer's rights to indemnification, payment of outstanding fees, reimbursement of Advances and other rights set forth in this Agreement which survive termination.  The Trustee and the Trust Advisor shall cooperate in using reasonable efforts to cause the satisfaction of the conditions to the consummation of such replacement set forth in Section 6.05(e).  The reasonable costs and expenses associated with the Trust Advisor's identification of a Qualified Replacement Special Servicer and the Certificate Administrator's obtaining such Rating Agency Confirmations administering the vote of the Certificateholders shall be an Additional Trust Fund Expense.  If a proposed termination and replacement of a Special Servicer recommended by the Trust Advisor as described above is not consummated within 180 days following the initial recommendation of the Trust Advisor, then (i) the proposed termination and replacement shall have no further force or effect, (ii) the Certificate Administrator shall post such notice to the Certificate Administrator's Website in accordance with Section 8.12(b) and (iii) the Certificate Administrator shall notify the Trustee and the then-current applicable Special Servicer.  The costs and expenses of administering the notices, solicitation of votes and otherwise incurred by the Certificate Administrator, the Trustee or the Trust Advisor in connection with the proposed removal and replacement (including the costs and expenses associated with obtaining Rating Agency Confirmations and the Opinion of Counsel referred to in Section 6.05(e)) shall constitute







 expenses of the Trust Fund to be paid by withdrawal from the Distribution Account.  None of the Special Servicers, any Certificateholder or any other Person shall have any cause of action against the Trust Advisor or any other Person based upon or arising from the Trust Advisor's determination under this Section 6.05(c), or the result of the vote of the Certificateholders.



 (d) [Reserved].



 (e) No removal of a Special Servicer and/or appointment of a successor thereto pursuant to this Section 6.05 shall be effective until the Trustee shall have received (A) a Rating Agency Confirmation from each Rating Agency with respect to such removal and/or appointment, (B) an Acknowledgment of Proposed Special Servicer in the form attached hereto as Exhibit I-2, executed by the Person designated to be the successor to that terminated Special Servicer, and (C) an Opinion of Counsel (the expense of which shall be deemed to be part of the expenses of the replacement) substantially to the effect that (1) such designated Person is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization, (2) the Acknowledgment of Proposed Special Servicer, the form of which is attached hereto as Exhibit I-2, has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by such designated Person and (3) upon the execution and delivery of the Acknowledgment of Proposed Special Servicer, such designated Person shall be bound by the terms of this Agreement and, subject to customary bankruptcy and insolvency exceptions and customary equity exceptions, this Agreement shall be enforceable against such designated Person in accordance with its terms.



 (f) Any Special Servicer terminated pursuant to this Section 6.05 shall be deemed to have been so terminated simultaneously with the designated successor's becoming the applicable Special Servicer hereunder; provided that (i) the terminated Special Servicer shall be entitled to receive, in connection with its termination, payment out of the Collection Account of all of its accrued and unpaid Special Servicing Fees, as and to the extent provided in Section 3.05(a), and reimbursement from the successor to such terminated Special Servicer of all outstanding Servicing Advances made by such terminated Special Servicer and all unpaid Advance Interest accrued on such outstanding Servicing Advances (in which case the successor to such terminated Special Servicer shall be deemed to have made such Servicing Advances at the same time that such terminated Special Servicer had actually made them), (ii) such terminated Special Servicer shall thereafter be entitled to Workout Fees, as and to the extent expressly permitted by Section 3.11(c), and (iii) such terminated Special Servicer shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Section 6.03, notwithstanding any such termination; and provided, further, that such terminated Special Servicer shall continue to be obligated to pay (and entitled to receive) all other amounts accrued to (or owing by) it under this Agreement on or prior to the effective date of such termination.  Such terminated Special Servicer shall cooperate (time being of the essence in connection with a termination under Section 6.05(b)) with the Trustee and the replacement to such terminated Special Servicer in effecting the transfer of such terminated Special Servicer's responsibilities and rights hereunder to its successor, including the transfer within two (2) Business Days of its termination becoming effective pursuant to this Section 6.05, to the replacement to such terminated Special Servicer for administration by it of all cash amounts that at the time are or should have been credited by such terminated Special Servicer to the REO Account maintained by it or to any Servicing Account or Reserve Account or should have been delivered to the applicable Master Servicer or that are thereafter received by or on behalf of such terminated Special Servicer with respect to any Mortgage Loan or REO







 Property.  No penalty or fee shall be payable to the terminated Special Servicer in connection with any termination under this Section 6.05.



 Section 6.06 Rights of the Depositor and the Trustee in Respect of the Master Servicers and the Special Servicers.



 Each of the Master Servicers and the Special Servicers shall afford the Depositor and the Trustee, upon reasonable notice, during normal business hours access to all records maintained by it in respect of its rights and obligations hereunder and access to such of its officers as are responsible for such obligations.  Upon reasonable request and as reasonably related to the performance of the obligations of the related Master Servicer and the related Special Servicer, as applicable, pursuant to this Agreement, each of the Master Servicers and the Special Servicers shall furnish the Depositor and the Trustee with its most recent publicly available annual audited financial statements (or, if not available, the most recent publicly available audited annual financial statements of its corporate parent) and such other information as is publicly available regarding its business, affairs, property and condition, financial or otherwise.  Each of the Master Servicers and the Special Servicers may affix to any such information described in this Section 6.06 provided by it any disclaimer it deems appropriate in its reasonable discretion.  The Depositor may, but is not obligated to, enforce the obligations of the Master Servicers or the Special Servicers hereunder and may, but is not obligated to, perform, or cause a designee to perform, any defaulted obligation of any Master Servicer or any Special Servicer hereunder or exercise the rights of a Master Servicer or a Special Servicer hereunder; provided, that neither a Master Servicer nor a Special Servicer shall be relieved of any of its obligations hereunder by virtue of such performance by the Depositor or its designee.  The Depositor shall not have any responsibility or liability for any action or failure to act by a Master Servicer or a Special Servicer and is not obligated to supervise the performance of any Master Servicer or any Special Servicer under this Agreement or otherwise.



 Section 6.07 Master Servicers and Special Servicers May Own Certificates.



 Any Master Servicer, Special Servicer or any of their respective Affiliates may become the Holder of (or, in the case of a Book-Entry Certificate, Certificate Owner with respect to) any Certificate with (except as otherwise set forth in the definition of "Certificateholder") the same rights it would have if it were not a Master Servicer, a Special Servicer or an Affiliate thereof.  If, at any time during which any Master Servicer, Special Servicer or Affiliate of any Master Servicer or any Special Servicer is the Holder of (or, in the case of a Book-Entry Certificate, Certificate Owner with respect to) any Certificate, that Master Servicer or that Special Servicer, as the case may be, proposes to take any action (including for this purpose, omitting to take a particular action) that is not expressly prohibited by the terms hereof and would not, in the reasonable judgment of that Master Servicer or that Special Servicer (as the case may be), violate the Servicing Standard, but that, if taken, might nonetheless, in the reasonable judgment of that Master Servicer or that Special Servicer (as the case may be), be considered by other Persons to violate the Servicing Standard, then that Master Servicer or that Special Servicer, as the case may be, may (but need not) seek the approval of the Certificateholders to such action by delivering to the Certificate Administrator (with a copy to the Trustee) a written notice that (a) states that it is delivered pursuant to this Section 6.07, (b) identifies the Percentage Interest in each Class of Certificates beneficially owned by that







 Master Servicer or that Special Servicer, as the case may be, or by an Affiliate thereof and (c) describes in reasonable detail the action that such Master Servicer or such Special Servicer, as the case may be, proposes to take.  The Certificate Administrator, upon receipt of such notice, shall forward it to the Certificateholders (other than that Master Servicer and its Affiliates or that Special Servicer and its Affiliates, as appropriate), together with a request for approval by the Certificateholders of each such proposed action.  If at any time Certificateholders holding greater than 50% of the Voting Rights of all Certificateholders (calculated without regard to the Certificates beneficially owned by that Master Servicer or its Affiliates or that Special Servicer or its Affiliates, as the case may be) shall have consented in writing (with a copy to each related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder, if a Serviced Loan Combination is involved) to the proposal described in the written notice, and if that Master Servicer or that Special Servicer, as the case may be, shall act as proposed in the written notice, such action shall be deemed to comply with the Servicing Standard.  The Certificate Administrator shall be entitled to reimbursement from that Master Servicer or that Special Servicer, as applicable, for the reasonable expenses of the Certificate Administrator incurred pursuant to this paragraph.  It is not the intent of the foregoing provision that a Master Servicer or a Special Servicer be permitted to invoke the procedure set forth herein with respect to routine servicing matters arising hereunder, but rather in the case of unusual circumstances.

 (viii) such Master Servicer or such Special Servicer shall consent to the appointment of a conservator, receiver, liquidator, trustee or similar official in any bankruptcy, insolvency, readjustment of debt, marshalling of assets and liabilities or similar proceedings of or relating to it or of or relating to all or substantially all of its property; or



 (ix) such Master Servicer or such Special Servicer shall admit in writing its inability to pay its debts generally as they become due, file a petition to take advantage of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization statute, make an assignment for the benefit of its creditors, voluntarily suspend payment of its obligations, or take any association or company action in furtherance of the foregoing; or



 (x) either of Moody's or KBRA has (A) qualified, downgraded or withdrawn its rating or ratings of one or more Classes of Rated Certificates, or (B) placed one or more Classes of Rated Certificates on "watch status" in contemplation of possible rating downgrade or withdrawal (and such "watch status" placement shall not have been withdrawn by Moody's or KBRA, as applicable, within sixty (60) days of such actual knowledge by such Master Servicer or such Special Servicer, as the case may be), and, in case of either of clause (A) or (B), citing servicing concerns with such Master Servicer or such Special Servicer as the sole or a material factor in such rating action;



 (xi) such Master Servicer ceases to have a Master Servicer rating of at least "CMS3" from Fitch and that rating is not reinstated within thirty (30) days or such Special Servicer ceases to have a Special Servicer rating of at least "CSS3" from Fitch and that rating is not reinstated within thirty (30) days, as the case may be;

 When a single entity acts as two or more of the capacities of a Master Servicer and a Special Servicer, a Servicer Termination Event (other than an event described in clauses (x), (xi) or (xii) above) in one capacity shall constitute a Servicer Termination Event in both or all such capacities.



 (b) If any Servicer Termination Event with respect to a Master Servicer or a Special Servicer (in either case, for purposes of this Section 7.01(b), the "Affected Party") shall occur and be continuing, then, and in each and every such case, so long as the Servicer Termination Event shall not have been remedied, the Trustee may, and at the written direction of either the Holders of Certificates entitled to not less than 25% of the Voting Rights (determined without notionally reducing the Class Principal Balances of the Certificates by any Appraisal Reduction Amounts), or, alternatively, if a Servicer Termination Event on the part of the applicable Special Servicer has occurred that affects a Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder, at the written direction of such Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder with respect to the related Loan Combination, or, alternatively, if a Servicer Termination Event on the part of the applicable Special Servicer has occurred, at the written direction of the Subordinate Class Representative during a Subordinate Control Period, or, alternatively, if a Servicer Termination Event under Section 7.01(a)(xiv) on the part of the Affected Party has occurred, at the written direction of the Depositor, the Trustee shall, terminate, by notice in writing to the Affected Party (with a copy of such notice to each other party hereto), all of the rights and obligations (accruing from and after such notice) of the Affected Party under this Agreement (other than as a Holder of any Certificate or as holder of a Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan, entitlements to amounts payable to the terminated party at the time of termination and any entitlements of the terminated party that survive the termination including any Excess Servicing Fee Rights).  From and after the receipt by the Affected Party of such written notice, all of the responsibilities, duties, authority and power of the Affected Party under this Agreement (and in







 the case of a termination of a Special Servicer at the direction of a Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder with respect to a Serviced Loan Combination, solely as they relate to such Serviced Loan Combination), whether with respect to the Certificates, the Mortgage Loans or otherwise (other than as a Holder of any Certificate or as a Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder, if applicable), shall pass to and be vested in the Trustee pursuant to and under this Section, and, without limitation, the Trustee is hereby authorized and empowered to execute and deliver, on behalf of and at the expense of the Affected Party, as attorney-in-fact or otherwise, any and all documents and other instruments, and to do or accomplish all other acts or things necessary or appropriate to effect the purposes of such notice of termination, whether to complete the transfer and endorsement or assignment of the Mortgage Loans and related documents, or otherwise (provided, that each of a Master Servicer and a Special Servicer shall, if terminated pursuant to this Section 7.01(b), continue to be obligated to pay and entitled to receive all amounts accrued or owing by or to it under this Agreement on or prior to the date of such termination, whether in respect of Advances or otherwise, and it and its members, managers, directors, officers, employees and agents shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Section 6.03 notwithstanding any such termination).  Each of a Master Servicer and a Special Servicer agrees that, if it is terminated pursuant to this Section 7.01(b), it shall promptly (and in any event no later than twenty (20) days subsequent to its receipt of the notice of termination) provide the Trustee with all documents and records requested thereby to enable the Trustee to assume the functions hereunder of such Master Servicer or such Special Servicer, as the case may be, and shall otherwise cooperate with the Trustee in effecting the termination of the rights and responsibilities hereunder of such Master Servicer or such Special Servicer, as the case may be, including the transfer within five (5) Business Days to the Trustee for administration by it of all cash amounts that at the time are or should have been credited by the applicable Master Servicer to the Collection Account or any Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Custodian Account, the Distribution Account or any Servicing Account or Reserve Account held by it (if it is the Affected Party) or by the applicable Special Servicer to its REO Account, the Collection Account, the Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Custodial Account or any Servicing Account or Reserve Account held by it (if it is the Affected Party) or that are thereafter received by or on behalf of it with respect to any Mortgage Loan or REO Property (provided, that if such Master Servicer or such Special Servicer is terminated pursuant to this Section 7.01(b), such Master Servicer or such Special Servicer, as the case may be, shall continue to be obligated to pay and entitled to receive all amounts accrued or owing by or to it under this Agreement on or prior to the date of such termination, whether in respect of Advances or otherwise, and it and its members, managers, directors, officers, employees and agents shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Section 6.03 notwithstanding any such termination).  Any costs or expenses (including those of any other party hereto or successor master servicer or special servicer) incurred in connection with any actions to be taken by a terminated Master Servicer or Special Servicer pursuant to this paragraph (including, but not limited to, in connection with transferring Mortgage Files, Servicing Files and related information, records and reports to the successor master servicer or special servicer and amending this Agreement to reflect (as well as providing appropriate notices to borrowers, ground lessors, insurers and other applicable third parties regarding) such succession as successor master servicer or special servicer) shall be borne by the applicable Master Servicer or the applicable Special Servicer, as the case may be (and, in the case of the Trustee's costs and expenses, if not paid within a reasonable time, shall be borne by the Trust out of the Collection Account).







 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 7.04, the Trustee shall not waive any Servicer Termination Event under Section 7.01(a)(xiv) without the prior written consent of the Depositor.  If a Servicer Termination Event under Section 7.01(a)(xiii) occurs on the part of a Master Servicer, or if any other Servicer Termination Event occurs on the part of a Master Servicer affecting a Serviced Loan Combination and such Master Servicer is not terminated pursuant to the provisions set forth above, whether as a result of a waiver or otherwise, any affected Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder shall be entitled to require such Master Servicer to appoint, in accordance with Section 3.22 and with the delivery of a Rating Agency Confirmation, a Sub-Servicer to be selected by such Master Servicer, that will be responsible for primary servicing such Serviced Loan Combination.



 (c) Notwithstanding Section 7.01(b) of this Agreement, if a Master Servicer receives a notice of termination solely due to a Servicer Termination Event under Section 7.01(a)(x), (xi) or (xii), and the terminated Master Servicer provides the Trustee with the appropriate "request for proposal" materials within the five (5) Business Days after such termination, then such Master Servicer shall continue to serve as Master Servicer, if requested to do so by the Trustee, and the Trustee shall promptly thereafter (using such "request for proposal" materials provided by the terminated Master Servicer) solicit good faith bids for the rights to master service the Mortgage Loans and Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan under this Agreement from at least three (3) Persons qualified to act as successor Master Servicer hereunder in accordance with Section 6.02 and Section 7.02 for which the Trustee has received Rating Agency Confirmation from each Rating Agency obtained by the terminated Master Servicer (any such Person so qualified, a "Qualified Bidder") or, if three (3) Qualified Bidders cannot be located, then from as many Persons as the Trustee can determine are Qualified Bidders; provided, that (i) at the Trustee's request, the terminated Master Servicer shall supply the Trustee with the names of Persons from whom to solicit such bids; and (ii) the Trustee shall not be responsible if less than three (3) or no Qualified Bidders submit bids for the right to master service the subject Mortgage Loans and Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan under this Agreement.  The bid proposal shall require any Successful Bidder (as defined below), as a condition of such bid, to enter into this Agreement as successor Master Servicer and to agree to be bound by the terms hereof, within forty-five (45) days after the receipt by such Master Servicer of a notice of termination.  The Trustee shall solicit bids (i) on the basis of such successor Master Servicer retaining all applicable Sub-Servicers to continue the sub-servicing of the applicable Serviced Mortgage Loans pursuant to the terms of the respective Sub-Servicing Agreements and entering into a Sub-Servicing Agreement with the terminated Master Servicer to service each of the Serviced Mortgage Loans not subject to a Sub-Servicing Agreement at a sub-servicing fee rate per annum equal to, for each Serviced Mortgage Loan serviced, the related Master Servicing Fee Rate minus the sum of one (1) basis point and the related Excess Servicing Fee Rate (each, a "Servicing-Retained Bid") and (ii) on the basis of terminating each applicable Sub-Servicing Agreement and each applicable Sub-Servicer that it is permitted to terminate in accordance with Section 3.22 and having no obligation to enter into a Sub-Servicing Agreement with the terminated Master Servicer (each, a "Servicing-Released Bid").  The Trustee shall select the Qualified Bidder with the highest cash Servicing-Retained Bid (or, if none, the highest cash Servicing-Released Bid) (the "Successful Bidder") to act as successor Master Servicer hereunder.  The Trustee shall direct the Successful Bidder to enter into this Agreement as successor Master Servicer pursuant to the terms hereof (and, if the successful bid was a Servicing-Retained Bid, to enter into a Sub-Servicing Agreement with the terminated Master







 Servicer as contemplated above), no later than forty-five (45) days after the termination of the terminated Master Servicer.



 (d) Upon the assignment and acceptance of the master servicing rights hereunder to and by the Successful Bidder, the Trustee shall remit or cause to be remitted to the terminated Master Servicer the amount of such cash bid received from the Successful Bidder (net of reasonable "out-of-pocket" expenses incurred in connection with obtaining such bid and transferring servicing).



 (e) If the Successful Bidder has not entered into this Agreement as successor Master Servicer within forty-five (45) days after the related Master Servicer received a notice of termination or no Successful Bidder was identified within such 45 day period, the terminated Master Servicer shall reimburse the Trustee for all reasonable "out-of-pocket" expenses incurred by the Trustee in connection with such bid process and the Trustee shall have no further obligations under Section 7.01(c).  The Trustee thereafter may act or may select a successor to act as Master Servicer hereunder in accordance with Section 7.02.



 Section 7.02 Trustee to Act; Appointment of Successor.



 (a) On and after the time a Master Servicer or a Special Servicer resigns pursuant to Section 6.04(a) (and a successor Master Servicer or Special Servicer, as applicable, has not been appointed by the resigning Master Servicer or Special Servicer, as applicable, under Section 6.04), or receives a notice of termination pursuant to Section 7.01, the Trustee shall be the successor in all respects to that Master Servicer or that Special Servicer, as the case may be, in its capacity as such under this Agreement and the transactions set forth or provided for herein and shall be subject to all the responsibilities, duties and liabilities relating thereto and arising thereafter placed on such Master Servicer or such Special Servicer, as the case may be, by the terms and provisions hereof, including, if the Master Servicer is the resigning or terminated party, the applicable Master Servicer's obligation to make Advances; provided, that (i) any failure to perform such duties or responsibilities caused by the failure of a Master Servicer or a Special Servicer, as the case may be, to cooperate or to provide information or monies as required by Section 7.01 shall not be considered a default by the Trustee hereunder and (ii) in the case of a terminated Master Servicer, the Trustee shall cease to act as successor Master Servicer if an alternative successor is appointed pursuant to Section 7.01(c).  Neither the Trustee nor any other successor shall be liable for any of the representations and warranties of the resigning or terminated party or for any losses incurred by the resigning or terminated party pursuant to Section 3.06 hereunder nor shall the Trustee or any other successor be required to purchase any Mortgage Loan hereunder.  As compensation therefor, the Trustee shall be entitled to all fees and other compensation which the resigning or terminated party would have been entitled to for future services rendered if the resigning or terminated party had continued to act hereunder.  Notwithstanding the above, if it is unwilling to so act, the Trustee may (and, if it is unable to so act, or if the Trustee is not approved as an acceptable master servicer or special servicer, as the case may be, by each Rating Agency, or if the Holders of Certificates entitled to a majority of all the Voting Rights (determined without notionally reducing the Class Principal Balances of the Certificates by any Appraisal Reduction Amounts) (or, alternatively, if a Servicer Termination Event on the part of the applicable Special Servicer has occurred during a Subordinate Control Period, the Subordinate Class Representative) so requests in writing, the Trustee shall), promptly







 appoint, or petition a court of competent jurisdiction to appoint, any established and qualified institution as the successor to the resigning or terminated Master Servicer or Special Servicer, as the case may be, hereunder in the assumption of all or any part of the responsibilities, duties or liabilities of such Master Servicer or such Special Servicer, as the case may be, hereunder; provided, that (i) such appointment is the subject of a Rating Agency Confirmation from each Rating Agency, and (ii) if such successor (in the case of a successor to the resigning or terminated Master Servicer) does not have a master servicer rating from Fitch that is "CMS3" or above, such successor is reasonably acceptable to the Subordinate Class Representative and, if such successor has a master servicer rating from Fitch that is "CMS3" or above, the Subordinate Class Representative shall have been consulted with respect to the identity of (although it need not have approved) such successor.  No appointment of a successor to a Master Servicer or a Special Servicer hereunder shall be effective until the assumption by such successor of all its responsibilities, duties and liabilities hereunder, and pending such appointment and assumption, the Trustee shall act in such capacity as hereinabove provided.  In connection with any such appointment and assumption, the Trustee may make such arrangements for the compensation of such successor out of payments on the Mortgage Loans or otherwise as it and such successor shall agree; provided, that no such compensation shall be in excess of that permitted the resigning or terminated party hereunder.  The Depositor, the Trustee, such successor and each other party hereto shall take such action, consistent with this Agreement, as shall be necessary to effectuate any such succession.



 If the Trustee or an Affiliate acts pursuant to this Section 7.02 as successor to the resigning or terminated Master Servicer and if the Excess Servicing Fee Rate is a rate per annum that is greater than zero (0) basis points, it may reduce the Excess Servicing Fee Rate to the extent that the Trustee's or such Affiliate's compensation as successor Master Servicer would otherwise be below the market rate servicing compensation.  If the Trustee elects to appoint a successor to the resigning or terminated Master Servicer other than itself or an Affiliate pursuant to this Section 7.02, it may reduce the Excess Servicing Fee Rate to the extent reasonably necessary (in the sole discretion of the Trustee) for the Trustee to appoint a qualified successor Master Servicer that meets the requirements of this Section 7.02.



 Section 7.03 Notification to Certificateholders.



 (a) Upon any resignation of a Master Servicer or a Special Servicer pursuant to Section 6.04, any replacement of a Special Servicer pursuant to Section 6.05, any termination of a Master Servicer or a Special Servicer pursuant to Section 7.01, any appointment of a successor to a Master Servicer or a Special Servicer pursuant to Section 6.02, 6.04 or 7.02 or the effectiveness of any designation of a new Special Servicer, the Trustee shall promptly notify (i) the Certificate Administrator, who shall give prompt written notice thereof to Certificateholders at their respective addresses appearing in the Certificate Register, (ii) the Rule 17g-5 Information Provider, who shall promptly post such information on the Rule 17g-5 Information Provider's Website in accordance with Section 8.12(b) and (iii) to any Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder.



 (b) Not later than the later of (i) sixty (60) days after the occurrence of any event which constitutes or, with notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a Servicer Termination Event and (ii) five (5) days after a Responsible Officer of the Trustee has actual







 knowledge of the occurrence of such an event, the Trustee shall notify the Depositor and the Certificate Administrator, who shall transmit by mail to all Certificateholders notice of such occurrence, unless such default shall have been cured.



 Section 7.04 Waiver of Servicer Termination Event.



 The Holders of Certificates representing at least 66-2/3% of the Voting Rights allocated to each Class of Certificates (and any affected Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder(s)) affected by any Servicer Termination Event hereunder (determined without notionally reducing the Class Principal Balances of the Certificates by any Appraisal Reduction Amounts) may waive such Servicer Termination Event without the consent of any other Person; provided, however that:



 (a) a Servicer Termination Event under clause (i), clause (ii), clause (iii), clause (x), clause (xi) or clause (xii) of Section 7.01(a) may be waived only by all of the Certificateholders of the affected Classes (and the affected Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder(s));



 (b) each Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder shall be exclusively entitled to waive a Servicer Termination Event under Section 7.01(a)(xiii) that arises with respect to the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan;



 (c) the Depositor shall be exclusively entitled to waive any Servicer Termination Event described in Section 7.01(a)(xiv);



 (d) no waiver of any Servicer Termination Event by one or more Persons will have any force or effect unless and until the Person requesting the waiver at its own expense has reimbursed the Trustee and the Certificate Administrator for any monies spent by them in connection with such Servicer Termination Event, together with interest thereon from and including the date so spent to but excluding the date of reimbursement and payment to the Trustee and the Certificate Administrator.



 Upon any such waiver of a Servicer Termination Event, such Servicer Termination Event shall cease to exist and shall be deemed to have been remedied for every purpose hereunder.  No such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Servicer Termination Event or impair any right consequent thereon except to the extent expressly so waived.  Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, for purposes of waiving any Servicer Termination Event pursuant to this Section 7.04, Certificates registered in the name of the Depositor or any Affiliate of the Depositor shall be entitled to the same Voting Rights with respect to the matters described above as they would if registered in the name of any other Person.



 Section 7.05 Additional Remedies of Trustee Upon Servicer Termination Event.



 During the continuance of any Servicer Termination Event, so long as such Servicer Termination Event shall not have been remedied, the Trustee, in addition to the rights specified in Section 7.01, shall have the right (exercisable subject to Section 8.01(a)), in its own name and as trustee of an express trust (in the case of any matter affecting a Serviced Loan







 Combination) on behalf of the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder(s), to take all actions now or hereafter existing at law, in equity or by statute to enforce its rights and remedies and to protect the interests, and enforce the rights and remedies, of the Certificateholders and such participants  (including the institution and prosecution of all judicial, administrative and other proceedings and the filings of proofs of claim and debt in connection therewith).  Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, no remedy provided for by this Agreement shall be exclusive of any other remedy, and each and every remedy shall be cumulative and in addition to any other remedy, and no delay or omission to exercise any right or remedy shall impair any such right or remedy or shall be deemed to be a waiver of any Servicer Termination Event.

 THE CERTIFICATE ADMINISTRATOR AND THE TAX ADMINISTRATOR



 Section 8.01 Duties of the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator and the Tax Administrator.



 (a) The Trustee, prior to the occurrence of a Servicer Termination Event and after the curing or waiver of all Servicer Termination Events which may have occurred, undertakes to perform such duties and only such duties as are specifically set forth in this Agreement.  If a Servicer Termination Event occurs and is continuing, the Trustee shall exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it by this Agreement, and use the same degree of care and skill in their exercise as a prudent person would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of such person's own affairs.  Any permissive right of the Trustee contained in this Agreement shall not be construed as a duty.  The Trustee, the Certificate Administrator and the Tax Administrator shall be liable in accordance herewith only to the extent of the respective obligations specifically imposed upon and undertaken by the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator and the Tax Administrator.



 (b) Upon receipt of all resolutions, certificates, statements, opinions, reports, documents, orders or other instruments furnished to the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator or the Tax Administrator, as applicable, which are specifically required to be furnished pursuant to any provision of this Agreement (other than the Mortgage Files, the review of which is specifically governed by the terms of Article II), the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator or the Tax Administrator, as applicable, shall examine them to determine whether they conform on their face to the requirements of this Agreement.  If any such instrument is found not to conform to the requirements of this Agreement in a material manner, the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator or the Tax Administrator, as applicable, shall take such action as it deems appropriate to have the instrument corrected.  The Trustee, the Certificate Administrator or the Tax Administrator, as applicable, shall not be responsible or liable for the accuracy or content of any resolution, certificate, statement, opinion, report, document, order or other instrument furnished by the Depositor, a Master Servicer, a Special Servicer, any Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder, any actual or prospective Certificateholder or Certificate Owner or any Rating Agency, and accepted by the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator or the Tax Administrator in good faith, pursuant to this Agreement.







 (c) No provision of this Agreement shall be construed to relieve the Trustee, the Tax Administrator or the Certificate Administrator from liability for its own negligent action, its own negligent failure to act or its own willful misconduct; provided, that:



 (i) prior to the occurrence of a Servicer Termination Event, and after the curing or waiver of all Servicer Termination Events which may have occurred, the duties and obligations of the Trustee shall be determined solely by the express provisions of this Agreement, the Trustee shall not be liable except for the performance of such duties and obligations as are specifically set forth in this Agreement, no implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this Agreement against the Trustee;



 (ii) in the absence of bad faith on the part of the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator or the Tax Administrator, the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator or the Tax Administrator, as applicable, may conclusively rely, as to the truth of the statements and the correctness of the opinions expressed therein, upon any certificates or opinions furnished to the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator or the Tax Administrator, as applicable, and conforming to the requirements of this Agreement;



 (iii) none of the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator or the Tax Administrator shall be liable for an error of judgment made in good faith by a Responsible Officer or Responsible Officers of such entity unless it shall be proved that such entity was negligent in ascertaining the pertinent facts;



 (iv) the Trustee shall not be liable with respect to any action taken, suffered or omitted to be taken by the Trustee, in good faith in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the direction of Holders of Certificates entitled to at least 25% (or, as to any particular matter, any higher percentage as may be specifically provided for hereunder) of the Voting Rights relating to the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred upon the Trustee, under this Agreement;



 (v) neither the Certificate Administrator nor the Trustee shall be required to take action with respect to, or be deemed to have notice or knowledge of, any default or Servicer Termination Event (other than a Master Servicer's failure to deliver any monies, including P&I Advances, or to provide any report, certificate or statement, to the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator or the Tax Administrator, as applicable, when required pursuant to this Agreement) unless a Responsible Officer of the Trustee or the Certificate Administrator shall have received written notice or otherwise have actual knowledge thereof.  Otherwise, the Trustee and the Certificate Administrator may conclusively assume that there is no such default or Servicer Termination Event;



 (vi) subject to the other provisions of this Agreement, and without limiting the generality of this Section 8.01, none of the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator or the Tax Administrator shall have any duty, except, in the case of the Trustee, as expressly provided in Section 2.01(b) or Section 2.01(e) or in its capacity as successor to a Master Servicer or a Special Servicer, (A) to cause any recording, filing, or depositing of this Agreement or any agreement referred to herein or any financing statement or







 continuation statement evidencing a security interest, or to cause the maintenance of any such recording or filing or depositing or to any re-recording, refiling or redepositing of any thereof, (B) to cause the maintenance of any insurance, (C) to confirm or verify the truth, accuracy or contents of any reports or certificates of a Master Servicer, a Special Servicer, any actual or prospective or any Certificateholder or Certificate Owner or any Rating Agency, delivered to the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator or the Tax Administrator pursuant to this Agreement reasonably believed by the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator or the Tax Administrator, as applicable, to be genuine and without error and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties, (D) subject to Section 10.01(f), to see to the payment or discharge of any tax levied against any part of the Trust Fund other than from funds available in the Collection Account or the Distribution Account, and (E) to see to the payment of any assessment or other governmental charge or any lien or encumbrance of any kind owing with respect to, assessed or levied against, any part of the Trust Fund other than from funds available in the Collection Account or the Distribution Account (provided that such assessment, charge, lien or encumbrance did not arise out of the Trustee's, the Certificate Administrator's or the Tax Administrator's, as applicable, willful misfeasance, bad faith or negligence);



 (vii) for as long as the Person that serves as the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator or the Tax Administrator hereunder also serves as Custodian and/or Certificate Registrar, the protections, immunities and indemnities afforded to that Person in its capacity as Trustee, Certificate Administrator or Tax Administrator, as applicable, hereunder shall also be afforded to such Person in its capacity as Custodian and/or Certificate Registrar, as the case may be; and



 (viii) if the same Person is acting in two or more of the capacities of Trustee, Certificate Administrator, Tax Administrator, Custodian or Certificate Registrar, then any notices required to be given by such Person in one such capacity shall be deemed to have been timely given to itself in any other such capacity.



 (d) Upon receipt by the Trustee or the Certificate Administrator of any notice regarding the transfer of a Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan by a Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder or the transfer of an interest in a mezzanine loan related to a Mortgage Loan by the related mezzanine lender, the Certificate Administrator or the Tax Administrator, as applicable, shall promptly forward a copy of such notice to the applicable Master Servicer and the applicable Special Servicer.



 (e) Based on information in its possession, the Certificate Administrator promptly shall provide written notice to the Trust Advisor, the Subordinate Class Representative, each Master Servicer and each Special Servicer of (i) the existence of a Collective Consultation Period or a Senior Consultation Period and (ii) the end of any Collective Consultation Period or Senior Consultation Period.  The Trust Advisor, a Master Servicer or a Special Servicer may at any time request from the Certificate Administrator written confirmation of whether there existed a Collective Consultation Period or a Senior Consultation Period during the current and/or previous calendar year and the Certificate Administrator shall deliver such confirmation to the requesting party within 10 days of such request.

 (viii) none of the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator or the Tax Administrator shall be responsible for any act or omission of a Master Servicer or a Special Servicer (unless, in the case of the Trustee, it is acting as a Master Servicer or a Special Servicer, as the case may be) or of the Trust Advisor, any Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder or the Depositor;

 The recitals contained herein and in the Certificates (other than the statements attributed to, and the representations and warranties of, the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator and/or the Tax Administrator in Article II, and the signature of the Certificate Registrar set forth on each outstanding Certificate) shall not be taken as the statements of the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator or the Tax Administrator, and none of the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator or the Tax Administrator assumes any responsibility for their correctness.  None of the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator or the Tax Administrator makes any representation as to the validity or sufficiency of this Agreement (except as regards the enforceability of this Agreement against it) or of any Certificate (other than as to the signature of the Certificate Administrator set forth thereon) or of any Mortgage Loan or related document.  None of the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator or the Tax Administrator shall be accountable for the use or application by the Depositor of any of the Certificates issued to it or of the proceeds of such Certificates, or for the use or application of any funds paid to the Depositor in respect of the assignment of the Mortgage Loans to the Trust, or any funds (other than with respect to any funds held by the Certificate Administrator) deposited in or withdrawn from the Collection Account or any other account by or on behalf of the Depositor, the applicable Master Servicer or the applicable Special Servicer (unless, in the case of the Trustee, it is acting in such capacity).  None of the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator or the Tax Administrator shall be responsible for the legality or validity of this Agreement (other than insofar as it relates to the representations and warranties of the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator or the Tax Administrator, as the case may be, hereunder) or the validity, priority, perfection or sufficiency of any security, lien or security interest granted to it hereunder or the filing of any financing statements or continuation statements, except to the extent set forth in Section 2.01(b) and Section 2.01(e) or to the extent the Trustee is acting as a Master Servicer or a Special Servicer and such Master Servicer or such Special Servicer, as the case may be, would be so responsible hereunder.  Except as contemplated by Section 12.02(a), none of the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator or the Tax Administrator shall be required to record this Agreement.



 Section 8.04 The Trustee, the Certificate Administrator and the Tax Administrator May Own Certificates.



 The Trustee (in its individual or any other capacity), the Certificate Administrator or the Tax Administrator or any of their respective Affiliates may become the owner or pledgee of Certificates with (except as otherwise provided in the definition of "Certificateholder") the







 same rights it would have if it were not the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator or the Tax Administrator or one of their Affiliates, as the case may be.



 Section 8.05 Fees and Expenses of the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator and the Tax Administrator; Indemnification of and by the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator and the Tax Administrator.



 (a) On each Distribution Date, the Certificate Administrator shall withdraw from the Distribution Account, out of general collections on the Mortgage Loans and REO Properties on deposit therein, prior to any distributions to be made therefrom to Certificateholders on such date, and pay to itself all Certificate Administrator Fees, and to the Trustee all Trustee Fees (which shall be a portion of the Certificate Administrator Fee), earned in respect of the Mortgage Loans and any successor REO Mortgage Loans through the end of the then most recently ended calendar month as compensation for all services rendered by the Trustee hereunder.  As to each Mortgage Loan and REO Mortgage Loan, the Trustee Fee and the Certificate Administrator Fee shall accrue during each calendar month, commencing with April 2014, at the Trustee Fee Rate or Certificate Administrator Fee Rate, as the case may be, on a principal amount equal to the Stated Principal Balance of such Mortgage Loan or REO Mortgage Loan, as the case may be, immediately following the Distribution Date in such calendar month (or, in the case of April 2014, on a principal amount equal to the Cut-off Date Principal Balance of the particular Mortgage Loan).  The Trustee Fee and Certificate Administrator Fee accrued during each calendar month shall be payable in the next succeeding calendar month.  With respect to each Mortgage Loan and REO Mortgage Loan, the Trustee Fee and the Certificate Administrator Fee shall be calculated on the same Interest Accrual Basis as is applicable to the accrual or deemed accrual of interest on such Mortgage Loan or REO Mortgage Loan, as the case may be.  The Trustee Fee (which shall not be limited by any provision of law in regard to the compensation of a trustee of an express trust) and the Certificate Administrator Fee (the latter of which includes the Tax Administrator Fee) shall constitute the sole compensation of the Trustee and the Certificate Administrator and the Tax Administrator, respectively, for such services to be rendered by it.  The Certificate Administrator shall be responsible for the payment of the Tax Administrator Fee.



 Notwithstanding the prior paragraph, if and to the extent that any loss, liability, cost or expense that is, pursuant to the prior paragraph, required to be borne by the Trust out of the Distribution Account or a Collection Account, relates to any Mortgage Loan that is part of a Serviced Loan Combination, (i) such loss, liability, cost or expense shall be payable out of amounts on deposit in respect of such Serviced Loan Combination in the Collection Account and any related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Custodial Account collectively, prior to payment from funds in the Distribution Account; and (ii) such loss, liability, cost or expense shall be payable out of amounts on deposit in the Collection Account and the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Custodial Account (withdrawals from those accounts shall be made in accordance with the related Intercreditor Agreement and pro rata according to the respective outstanding principal balances of the Mortgage Loan and Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan included in the related Serviced Loan Combination).  Insofar as any such loss, liability, cost or expense related to any Serviced Loan Combination is so paid by withdrawal from the Collection Account or Distribution Account and funds are subsequently received and allocable to the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan(s), then the applicable Master Servicer shall deposit the







 amount of such loss, liability, cost or expense into the Collection Account from such funds so received and allocable to the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan.



 (b) The Trustee, the Certificate Administrator and the Tax Administrator (each in its capacity as such or in its individual capacity) and any of their respective directors, officers, employees, agents or affiliates are entitled to be indemnified and held harmless by the Trust Fund out of the Collection Account and/or the Distribution Account, as and to the extent provided in Section 3.05, for and against any loss, liability, claim or expense (including costs and expenses of litigation, and of investigation, reasonable counsel fees, damages, judgments and amounts paid in settlement) arising out of, or incurred in connection with, this Agreement, the Certificates, the Mortgage Loans (unless, in the case of the Trustee, it incurs any such expense or liability in the capacity of successor to the applicable Master Servicer or the applicable Special Servicer (as the case may be), in which case such expense or liability will be reimbursable thereto in the same manner as it would be for any other Master Servicer or Special Servicer, as the case may be) or any act or omission of the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator or the Tax Administrator relating to the exercise and performance of any of the rights and duties, including the appointment of a replacement Trust Advisor, of the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator or the Tax Administrator hereunder; provided, that none of the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator or the Tax Administrator shall be entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Section 8.05(b) for (1) allocable overhead, such as costs for office space, office equipment, supplies and related expenses, employee salaries and related expenses and similar internal costs and expenses, (2) any cost or expense that does not constitute an "unanticipated expense" within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.860G-1(b)(3)(ii), (3) any expense or liability specifically required to be borne thereby pursuant to the terms hereof or (4) any loss, liability, claim or expense incurred by reason of any breach on the part of the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator or the Tax Administrator of any of their respective representations, warranties or covenants contained herein or any willful misconduct, bad faith, fraud or negligence in the performance of, or negligent disregard of, the Trustee's, the Certificate Administrator's or the Tax Administrator's obligations and duties hereunder.



 (c) The Master Servicers and the Special Servicers each shall indemnify the Trust, the Trustee, the Custodian, the Certificate Administrator and the Tax Administrator (each in their respective capacity as such and in their individual capacity) for and hold each of them harmless against any loss, liability, claim or expense that is a result of such Master Servicer's or such Special Servicer's, as the case may be, negligent acts or omissions in connection with this Agreement, including the negligent use by such Master Servicer or such Special Servicer, as the case may be, of any powers of attorney delivered to it by the Trustee pursuant to the provisions hereof and the Mortgage Loans serviced by the applicable Master Servicer or the applicable Special Servicer, as the case may be; provided, that, if the Trustee, the Custodian, the Certificate Administrator or the Tax Administrator has been reimbursed for such loss, liability, claim or expense pursuant to Section 8.05(b), then the indemnity in favor of such Person provided for in this Section 8.05(c) with respect to such loss, liability, claim or expense shall be for the benefit of the Trust.  For the purposes of this paragraph, a Master Servicer or Special Servicer will be deemed not to have committed negligent acts or omissions in connection with this Agreement if such Master Servicer or Special Servicer, as applicable, fails to follow the terms of the Mortgage Loan Documents because such Master Servicer or Special Servicer, as applicable, in its reasonably exercised judgment determines that following the terms of the Mortgage Loan







 Documents would or potentially would result in an Adverse REMIC Event (for which determination, each Master Servicer and each Special Servicer shall be entitled to rely on advice of counsel, the cost of which shall be reimbursed as an Additional Trust Fund Expense).  In no event shall the Master Servicers or the Special Servicers be liable for special, punitive, indirect or consequential loss or damage of any kind whatsoever (including but not limited to lost profits), even if the Master Servicers or the Special Servicers have been advised of the likelihood of such loss or damage and regardless of the form of action.



 (d) Each of the Trustee, the Custodian, the Certificate Administrator and the Tax Administrator shall indemnify each of the Trust, the Master Servicers and the Special Servicers and each other (each in their respective capacity as such and in their individual capacity) for and hold each of them harmless against any loss, liability, claim or expense that is a result of the Trustee's, the Certificate Administrator's, the Custodian's or the Tax Administrator's, as the case may be, negligent acts or omissions in connection with this Agreement; provided, that if such indemnified person has been reimbursed for such loss, liability, claim or expense pursuant to Section 6.03 or Section 8.05(b), as the case may be, then the indemnity in favor of such Person otherwise provided for in this Section 8.05(d) with respect to such loss, liability, claim or expense shall be for the benefit of the Trust.



 (e) The Certificate Administrator shall indemnify and hold harmless the Depositor, each Mortgage Loan Seller and each Underwriter from and against any claims, losses, damages, penalties, fines, forfeitures, legal fees and expenses and related costs, judgments and other costs and expenses incurred by the Depositor, each Mortgage Loan Seller, each Underwriter or any of their respective Affiliates that arise out of or are based upon (i) a breach by the Certificate Administrator, in its capacity as Rule 17g-5 Information Provider, of its obligations under this Agreement or (ii) negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct on the part of the Certificate Administrator, in its capacity as Rule 17g-5 Information Provider, in the performance of such obligations or its negligent disregard of its obligations and duties under this Agreement.



 (f) This Section 8.05 shall survive the termination of this Agreement or the resignation or removal of the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator, the Tax Administrator, a Master Servicer or a Special Servicer as regards rights and obligations prior to such termination, resignation or removal.

In addition:  (i) the Trustee shall at all times meet the requirements of Section 26(a)(1) of the Investment Company Act; and (ii) the Trustee may not have any affiliations or act in any other capacity with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby that would cause the Exemption to be unavailable with respect to any Class of Certificates as to which it would otherwise be available.  Furthermore, the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator and the Tax Administrator shall at all times maintain a long-term unsecured debt rating of at least ''A-'' by Fitch and "A1" by Moody's (or "A2 by Moody's if the applicable entity has a short term unsecured debt rating of at least "P-1" by Moody's) and, if rated by KBRA, an equivalent rating by KBRA and a short-term unsecured debt rating of at least "F-1" by Fitch and "P-1" by Moody's (or, in the case of any such Rating Agency, such lower rating as is the subject of a Rating Agency Confirmation by such Rating Agency).

 (b) If at any time the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator or the Tax Administrator shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of Section 8.06 and shall fail to resign after written request therefor by the Depositor or a Master Servicer, or if at any time the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator or the Tax Administrator shall become incapable of acting, or shall be adjudged bankrupt or insolvent, or a receiver of the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator or the Tax Administrator or of its property shall be appointed, or any public officer shall take charge or control of the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator or the Tax Administrator or of its property or affairs for the purpose of rehabilitation, conservation or liquidation, or if the Trustee's, Certificate Administrator's or Tax Administrator's continuing to act in such capacity would result in an Adverse Rating Event with respect to any Class of Rated Certificates rated by a Rating Agency for the Rated Certificates, as confirmed in writing to the Depositor by each applicable Rating Agency, then the Depositor may (and, if it fails to do so within ten (10) Business Days, the requesting Master Servicer shall as soon as practicable) remove the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator or the Tax Administrator, as the case may be, and appoint a successor trustee, certificate administrator or tax administrator, as the case may be, by written instrument, in duplicate, which instrument shall be delivered to the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator or the Tax Administrator, as the case may be, so removed and to the successor trustee, certificate administrator or tax administrator, as the case may be.  A copy of such instrument shall be delivered to the other parties hereto and to the Certificateholders by the Depositor.



 (c) The Holders of Certificates entitled to more than 50% of the Voting Rights may at any time remove the Trustee, Certificate Administrator or Tax Administrator and appoint a successor trustee, certificate administrator or tax administrator, as the case may be, by written instrument or instruments signed by such Holders or their attorneys-in-fact duly authorized, one complete set of which instruments shall be delivered to the Depositor, one complete set to the Trustee, Certificate Administrator or Tax Administrator, as the case may be, so removed, and one complete set to the successor so appointed.

 (e) Upon resignation, assignment, merger, consolidation, or transfer of the Trustee or its business to a successor, or upon the removal of the Trustee, the outgoing Trustee at its own expense (without right of reimbursement therefor) shall ensure that, prior to consummation of such transaction or as part of its transfer of duties to any successor, (i) the original executed Mortgage Note for each Mortgage Loan (to the extent that the original executed Mortgage Note for each Mortgage Loan was endorsed to the outgoing trustee) is endorsed (without recourse, representation or warranty, express or implied) to the order of the successor, as trustee for the Certificateholders (with the endorsement to recite as endorsee "[name of successor Trustee], as Trustee for the registered holders of RBS Commercial Funding Inc., Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2014-C19"), or in blank, and further showing a complete, unbroken chain of endorsement from the originator (if such originator is not the applicable Mortgage Loan Seller) (or, alternatively, if the original executed Mortgage Note has been lost, a lost note affidavit and indemnity with a copy of such Mortgage Note), and (ii) in the case of the other Mortgage Loan Documents, the same are assigned (and, other than in connection with the removal of the Trustee pursuant to Section 8.07(c), recorded as appropriate) to such successor (with the assignment to recite as assignee "[name of successor Trustee], as Trustee for the registered holders of RBS Commercial Funding Inc., Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2014-C19"), or in blank, and such successor shall review the documents delivered to it or the Custodian with respect to each Mortgage Loan, and certify in writing that, as to each Mortgage Loan then subject to this Agreement, such endorsement and assignment has been made.  The outgoing Trustee shall provide copies of the documentation provided for in items (i) and (ii) above to the applicable Master Servicer, in each case to the extent such copies are not already in the applicable Master Servicer's possession.  If the Trustee is removed pursuant to Section 8.07(c), the Mortgage Loan Documents identified in clause (ii) of the preceding sentence shall, if appropriate, be recorded by the successor trustee if so requested by the applicable Master Servicer or the applicable Special Servicer and at the expense of the Trust (i) during any Subordinate Control Period, with the consent of the Subordinate Class Representative, (ii) during any Collective Consultation Period, after consultation with the Subordinate Class Representative and the Trust Advisor and (iii) during any Senior Consultation Period, after consultation with the Trust Advisor.

 Section 8.10 Appointment of Co-Trustee or Separate Trustee.



 (a) Notwithstanding any other provisions hereof, at any time, for the purpose of meeting any legal requirements of any jurisdiction in which any part of the Trust Fund or property securing the same may at the time be located, the Master Servicers and the Trustee acting jointly shall have the power and shall execute and deliver all instruments to appoint one or more Persons approved by the Trustee to act as co-trustee or co-trustees, jointly with the Trustee, or separate trustee or separate trustees, of all or any part of the Trust Fund, and to vest in such Person or Persons, in such capacity, such title to the Trust Fund, or any part thereof, and, subject to the other provisions of this Section 8.10, such powers, duties, obligations, rights and trusts as the Master Servicers and the Trustee may consider necessary or desirable.  If the Master Servicers shall not have joined in such appointment within fifteen (15) days after the receipt by it of a request to do so, or in case a Servicer Termination Event in respect of the applicable Master Servicer shall have occurred and be continuing, the Trustee alone shall have the power to make such appointment.  No co-trustee or separate trustee hereunder shall be required to meet the terms of eligibility as a successor trustee under Section 8.06, and no notice to Holders of Certificates of the appointment of co-trustee(s) or separate trustee(s) shall be required under Section 8.08.



 (b) In the case of any appointment of a co-trustee or separate trustee pursuant to this Section 8.10, all rights, powers, duties and obligations conferred or imposed upon the Trustee shall be conferred or imposed upon and exercised or performed by the Trustee and such separate trustee or co-trustee jointly, except to the extent that under any law of any jurisdiction in which any particular act or acts are to be performed (whether as Trustee hereunder or when acting as a Master Servicer or Special Servicer hereunder), the Trustee shall be incompetent or unqualified to perform such act or acts, in which event such rights, powers, duties and obligations (including the holding of title to the Trust Fund or any portion thereof in any such jurisdiction) shall be exercised and performed by such separate trustee or co-trustee at the direction of the Trustee.







 (c) Any notice, request or other writing given to the Trustee shall be deemed to have been given to each of the then separate trustees and co-trustees, as effectively as if given to each of them.  Every instrument appointing any separate trustee or co-trustee shall refer to this Agreement and the conditions of this Article VIII.  Each separate trustee and co-trustee, upon its acceptance of the trusts conferred, shall be vested with the estates or property specified in its instrument of appointment, either jointly with the Trustee or separately, as may be provided therein, subject to all the provisions of this Agreement, specifically including every provision of this Agreement relating to the conduct of, affecting the liability of, or affording protection to, the Trustee.

 (d) Any separate trustee or co-trustee may, at any time, constitute the Trustee, its agent or attorney in fact, with full power and authority, to the extent not prohibited by law, to do any lawful act under or in respect of this Agreement on its behalf and in its name.  If any separate trustee or co-trustee shall die, become incapable of acting, resign or be removed, all of its estates, properties, rights, remedies and trusts shall vest in and be exercised by the Trustee, to the extent permitted by law, without the appointment of a new or successor trustee.

The Custodian may at any time resign by giving at least thirty (30) days' advance written notice of resignation to the Certificate Administrator, the Trustee, the Master Servicers, the Special Servicers and the Depositor.  The resigning Custodian shall be required to pay all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses of each party to this Agreement, the Trust and each Rating Agency in connection with the resignation of the Custodian and the transfer of its duties (including, but not limited to, reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses associated with the engagement of a successor, transferring Mortgage Files and related information, records and reports to the successor).  The Custodian shall comply with the requirements for Trustees set forth in Section 8.06 and shall have in place a fidelity bond and errors and omissions policy, each in such form and amount as is customarily required of custodians acting on behalf of Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae (or shall self-insure, to the extent that the Custodian is otherwise permitted to self-insure by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac).  The Custodian may be removed by the Holders of Certificates entitled to more than 50% of the Voting Rights in a manner consistent with the provisions of Section 8.07 (to the extent applicable).

 Following the date on which the aggregate Certificate Principal Balance of the Class A-1, Class A-2, Class A-3, Class A-4, Class A-5, Class A-SB and Class D Certificates and the Class A-S, Class B and Class C Regular Interests is reduced to zero, the Sole Certificateholder(s) shall have the right to exchange all of the Certificates for all of the Mortgage Loans and each REO Property or, in the case of any REO Property related to any Serviced Loan Combination, the beneficial interest of the Trust Fund in such REO Property, remaining in the Trust Fund as contemplated by clause (ii) of Section 9.01(a) by giving written notice to all the parties hereto no later than sixty (60) days prior to the anticipated date of exchange.  If the Sole Certificateholder(s) elect(s) to exchange all of the Certificates for all of the Mortgage Loans and each REO Property remaining in the Trust Fund in accordance with the preceding sentence, such Sole Certificateholder(s), not later than the Business Day prior to the Distribution Date on which the final distribution on the Certificates is to occur, shall deposit in the Collection Account of the General Master Servicer an amount in immediately available funds equal to all amounts then due and owing to the Depositor, the Master Servicers, the Special Servicers, the Certificate Administrator, the Tax Administrator and/or the Trustee hereunder (and their respective agents) that may be withdrawn from the Collection Account, pursuant to Section 3.05(a), or that may be withdrawn from the Distribution Account, pursuant to Section 3.05(b), but only to the extent that such amounts are not already on deposit in the Collection Account.  In addition, each Master Servicer shall transfer to the Distribution Account all amounts required to be transferred by it to such account on the Master Servicer Remittance Date from its Collection Account pursuant to the first paragraph of Section 3.04(b).  Upon confirmation that such final deposits have been made and following the surrender of all the Certificates on the Final Distribution Date, the Trustee shall release or cause to be released to the Sole Certificateholder(s) (or any designee thereof), the Mortgage Files for the remaining Mortgage Loans and shall execute all assignments, endorsements and other instruments furnished to it by the Sole Certificateholder(s) as shall be necessary to effectuate transfer of the remaining Mortgage Loans and REO Properties to the Sole Certificateholder(s) (or any designee thereof).  For federal income tax purposes, such surrender and release shall be treated as a purchase of such Mortgage Loans and REO Properties for an amount of cash equal to all amounts due in respect thereof after the distribution of amounts remaining in the Distribution Account, and a crediting of such amounts as a final







 distribution on all remaining REMIC I Regular Interests, REMIC II Regular Interests, Regular Certificates and the Class A-S, Class B and Class C Regular Interests.



 (c) Notice of any termination shall be given promptly by the Certificate Administrator by letter to Certificateholders posted to the Certificate Administrator's Website and mailed (x) if such notice is given in connection with the purchase of all the Mortgage Loans and each REO Property remaining in the Trust Fund by a Master Servicer, a Special Servicer or any Subordinate Class Certificateholder(s), not earlier than the 15th day and not later than the 25th day of the month next preceding the month of the final distribution on the Certificates and (y) otherwise during the month of such final distribution on or before the Master Servicer Remittance Date in such month, in any event specifying (i) the Distribution Date upon which the Trust Fund will terminate and final payment on the Certificates will be made, (ii) the amount of any such final payment in respect of each Class of Certificates and (iii) that the Record Date otherwise applicable to such Distribution Date is not applicable, payments being made only upon presentation and surrender of the Certificates at the office or agency of the Certificate Administrator therein designated.  The Certificate Administrator shall give such notice to the other parties hereto at the time such notice is given to Certificateholders.



 (d) Upon presentation and surrender of the Certificates by the Certificateholders on the Final Distribution Date, the Certificate Administrator shall distribute to each Certificateholder so presenting and surrendering its Certificates such Certificateholder's Percentage Interest of that portion of the amounts on deposit in the Distribution Account that is allocable to payments on the relevant Class in accordance with Section 4.01.  Any funds not distributed to any Holder or Holders of Certificates of any Class on the Final Distribution Date because of the failure of such Holder or Holders to tender their Certificates shall, on such date, be set aside and held uninvested in trust and credited to the account or accounts of the appropriate non-tendering Holder or Holders.  If any Certificates as to which notice has been given pursuant to this Section 9.01 shall not have been surrendered for cancellation within six (6) months after the time specified in such notice, the Certificate Administrator shall mail a second notice to the remaining non-tendering Certificateholders to surrender their Certificates for cancellation in order to receive the final distribution with respect thereto.  If within one year after the second notice all such Certificates shall not have been surrendered for cancellation, the Certificate Administrator, directly or through an agent, shall take such reasonable steps to contact the remaining non-tendering Certificateholders concerning the surrender of their Certificates as it shall deem appropriate.  The costs and expenses of holding such funds in trust and of contacting such Certificateholders following the first anniversary of the delivery of such second notice to the non-tendering Certificateholders shall be paid out of such funds.  No interest shall accrue or be payable to any former Holder on any amount held in trust hereunder.  If by the second anniversary of the delivery of such second notice, all of the Certificates shall not have been surrendered for cancellation, then, subject to applicable escheat laws, the Certificate Administrator shall distribute to the Class R Certificateholders all unclaimed funds and other assets which remain subject hereto.

 (b) By their acceptance of Certificates, the Holders of the Certificates hereby authorize the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator and the Tax Administrator to prepare and adopt, on behalf of the Trust, a plan of complete liquidation of each REMIC Pool in the form of the notice of termination provided for in Section 9.01(c) and in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, which authorization shall be binding upon all successor Certificateholders.

The Tax Administrator may consult with counsel to make such written advice, and the cost of same shall be borne by the party seeking to take the action not permitted by this Agreement (and in no event by the Trust Fund or the Tax Administrator).



 (f) If any tax is imposed on any REMIC Pool, including "prohibited transactions" taxes as defined in Section 860F(a)(2) of the Code, any tax on "net income from foreclosure property" as defined in Section 860G(c) of the Code, any taxes on contributions to any REMIC Pool after the Startup Day pursuant to Section 860G(d) of the Code, and any other tax imposed by the Code or any applicable provisions of state or local tax laws (other than any tax permitted to be incurred by a Special Servicer pursuant to Section 3.17(a)), then such tax, together with all incidental costs and expenses (including penalties and reasonable attorneys' fees), shall be charged to and paid by:  (i) the Trustee, if such tax arises out of or results from a breach of any of its obligations under Article IV, Article VIII or this Section 10.01 (which breach constitutes negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct); (ii) the Certificate Administrator, if such tax arises out of or results from a breach by the Certificate Administrator of any of its obligations under Article IV, Article VIII or this Section 10.01 (which breach constitutes negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct); (iii) a Tax Administrator, if such tax arises out of or results from a breach by the Tax Administrator of any of its obligations under Article IV, Article VIII or this Section 10.01 (which breach constitutes negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct); (iv) a Master Servicer, if such tax arises out of or results from a breach by such Master Servicer of any of its obligations under Article III or this Section 10.01 (which breach constitutes negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct); (v) the applicable Special Servicer, if such tax arises out of or results from a breach by such Special Servicer of any of its obligations under Article III or this Section 10.01 (which breach constitutes negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct); or (vi) the Trust, out of the Trust Fund, in all other instances.  Consistent with the foregoing, any tax permitted to be incurred by the applicable Special Servicer pursuant to Section 3.17(a) shall be charged to and paid by the Trust.  Any such amounts payable by the Trust in respect of taxes shall be paid by the Trustee out of amounts on deposit in the Distribution Account.







 (g) The Tax Administrator shall, for federal income tax purposes, maintain books and records with respect to each REMIC Pool on a calendar year and an accrual basis.



 (h) Following the Startup Day for each REMIC Pool, the Trustee shall not (except as contemplated by Section 2.03) accept any contributions of assets to any REMIC Pool unless it shall have received an Opinion of Counsel (at the expense of the party seeking to cause such contribution and in no event at the expense of the Trust Fund or the Trustee) to the effect that the inclusion of such assets in such REMIC Pool will not result in an Adverse REMIC Event in respect of such REMIC Pool.



 (i) None of the Master Servicers, the Special Servicers or the Trustee shall consent to or, to the extent it is within the control of such Person, permit:  (i) the sale or disposition of any Mortgage Loan (except in connection with (A) a Breach or Document Defect regarding any Mortgage Loan, (B) the foreclosure, default or reasonably foreseeable material default of a Mortgage Loan, including the sale or other disposition of a Mortgaged Property acquired by foreclosure, deed in lieu of foreclosure or otherwise, (C) the bankruptcy of any REMIC Pool, or (D) the termination of the Trust pursuant to Article IX of this Agreement); (ii) the sale or disposition of any investments in any Investment Account for gain; or (iii) the acquisition of any assets for the Trust (other than a Mortgaged Property acquired through foreclosure, deed in lieu of foreclosure or otherwise in respect of a Defaulted Mortgage Loan, other than a Replacement Mortgage Loan substituted for a Deleted Mortgage Loan and other than Permitted Investments acquired in connection with the investment of funds in an Account or an interest in a single-member limited liability company, as provided in Section 3.16); in any event unless it has received an Opinion of Counsel (at the expense of the party seeking to cause such sale, disposition, or acquisition and in no event at the expense of the Trust Fund or the Trustee) to the effect that such sale, disposition, or acquisition will not result in an Adverse REMIC Event in respect of any REMIC Pool.



 (j) Except as otherwise permitted by Section 3.17(a), none of the Master Servicers, the Special Servicers or the Trustee shall enter into any arrangement by which any REMIC Pool will receive a fee or other compensation for services or, to the extent it is within the control of such Person, permit any REMIC Pool to receive any income from assets other than "qualified mortgages" as defined in Section 860G(a)(3) of the Code or "permitted investments" as defined in Section 860G(a)(5) of the Code.  At all times as may be required by the Code, each of the respective parties hereto (to the extent it is within its control) shall take necessary actions within the scope of its responsibilities as more specifically set forth in this Agreement such that it does not cause substantially all of the assets of each REMIC Pool to fail to consist of "qualified mortgages" as defined in Section 860G(a)(3) of the Code and "permitted investments" as defined in Section 860G(a)(5) of the Code.

The Tax Administrator shall also perform on behalf of the Grantor Trust Pool all reporting and other tax compliance duties that are the responsibility of such Grantor Trust Pool under the Code or any compliance guidance issued by the IRS or any state or local taxing authorities.  The expenses of preparing and filing such returns shall be borne by the Tax Administrator.



 (b) The Tax Administrator shall pay out of its own funds any and all routine tax administration expenses of the Trust Fund incurred with respect to the Grantor Trust Pool (but not including any professional fees or expenses related to audits or any administrative or judicial proceedings with respect to the Trust Fund that involve the IRS or state tax authorities which extraordinary expenses shall be payable or reimbursable to the Tax Administrator from the assets in the Grantor Trust Pool, unless otherwise provided in Section 10.02(e) or 10.02(f)).



 (c) The Tax Administrator shall prepare or cause to be prepared, submit to the Trustee for execution (and the Trustee shall timely execute and timely return to the Tax Administrator) and timely file all of the Tax Returns in respect of the Grantor Trust Pool.  The expenses of preparing and filing such returns shall be borne by the Tax Administrator without any right of reimbursement therefor.

There shall be appended to each such form a schedule for each Certificateholder indicating such Certificateholder's share of income and expenses of the Trust for the portion of the preceding calendar year in which such Certificateholder possessed an Ownership Interest in a Certificate.  Such form shall be prepared in sufficient detail to enable reporting on the cash or accrual method of accounting, as applicable, and to report on such Certificateholder's fiscal year if other than the calendar year.



 (d) The other parties hereto shall provide on a timely basis to the Tax Administrator or its designee such information with respect to the Grantor Trust Pool as is in its possession and reasonably requested by the Tax Administrator to enable it to perform its obligations under this Section 10.02.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Depositor, within ten (10) days following the Tax Administrator's request therefor, shall provide in writing to the Tax Administrator such information as is reasonably requested by the Tax Administrator for tax purposes, and the Tax Administrator's duty to perform its reporting and other tax compliance obligations under this Section 10.02 shall be subject to the condition that it receives from the Depositor such information possessed by the Depositor that is necessary to permit the Tax Administrator to perform such obligations.



 (e) The Tax Administrator shall perform on behalf of the Grantor Trust Pool all reporting and other tax compliance duties that are required in respect thereof under the Code, the Grantor Trust Provisions or other compliance guidance issued by the IRS or any state or local taxing authority, including the furnishing to Certificateholders of the schedules described in Section 10.02(c).







 (f) The Tax Administrator shall perform its duties hereunder so as to maintain the status of the Grantor Trust Pool as Grantor Trust under the Grantor Trust Provisions (and the Trustee, the Master Servicers and the Special Servicers shall assist the Tax Administrator to the extent reasonably requested by the Tax Administrator and to the extent of information within the Trustee's, the Master Servicers' or the Special Servicers' possession or control).  None of the Tax Administrator, Master Servicers, the Special Servicers or the Trustee shall knowingly take (or cause the Grantor Trust Pool to take) any action or fail to take (or fail to cause to be taken) any action that, under the Grantor Trust Provisions, if taken or not taken, as the case may be, could result in an Adverse Grantor Trust Event, unless the Tax Administrator has obtained or received an Opinion of Counsel (at the expense of the party requesting such action or at the expense of the Trust Fund if the Tax Administrator seeks to take such action or to refrain from taking any action for the benefit of the Certificateholders) to the effect that the contemplated action will not result in an Adverse Grantor Trust Event.  None of the other parties hereto shall take any action or fail to take any action (whether or not authorized hereunder) as to which the Tax Administrator has advised it in writing that the Tax Administrator has received or obtained an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that an Adverse Grantor Trust Event could result from such action or failure to act.  In addition, prior to taking any action with respect to the Grantor Trust Pool, or causing the Trust Fund to take any action, that is not expressly permitted under the terms of this Agreement, the Master Servicers and the Special Servicers shall consult with the Tax Administrator or its designee, in writing, with respect to whether such action could cause an Adverse Grantor Trust Event to occur.  The Tax Administrator may consult with counsel to make such written advice, and the cost of same shall be borne by the party seeking to take the action not permitted by this Agreement, but in no event at the cost or expense of the Trust Fund, the Tax Administrator or the Trustee.



 (g) If any tax is imposed on the Grantor Trust Pool pursuant to the Code or any applicable provisions of state or local tax laws, then such tax, together with all incidental costs and expenses (including penalties and reasonable attorneys' fees), shall be charged to and paid by:  (i) the Trustee, if such tax arises out of or results from a breach of any of its obligations under Article IV, Article VIII or this Section 10.02 (which breach constitutes negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct); (ii) the Certificate Administrator, if such tax arises out of or results from a breach by the Certificate Administrator of any of its obligations under Article IV, Article VIII or this Section 10.02 (which breach constitutes negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct); (iii) the Tax Administrator, if such tax arises out of or results from a breach by the Tax Administrator of any of its obligations under Article IV, Article VIII or this Section 10.02 (which breach constitutes negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct); (iv) a Master Servicer, if such tax arises out of or results from a breach by such Master Servicer of any of its obligations under Article III or this Section 10.02 (which breach constitutes negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct); (v) a Special Servicer, if such tax arises out of or results from a breach by such Special Servicer of any of its obligations under Article III or this Section 10.02 (which breach constitutes negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct); or (vi) the Trust, out of the Trust Fund, in all other instances.  Any such amounts payable by the Trust in respect of taxes shall be paid by the Trustee out of amounts on deposit in the Distribution Account.



 (h) The Grantor Trust is a WHFIT that is a WHMT.  The Tax Administrator will report as required under the WHFIT Regulations to the extent such information as is reasonably necessary to enable the Tax Administrator to do so is provided to the Tax







 Administrator on a timely basis.  The Certificate Administrator shall provide such information in its possession to the Tax Administrator on a timely basis.  With respect to the Class A-S, Class B, Class C and Class PEX Certificates, the Tax Administrator is hereby directed to assume that DTC is the only "middleman" as defined by the WHFIT Regulations unless the Depositor provides the Tax Administrator with the identities of other "middlemen" that are Certificateholders.  With respect to the Class V Certificates, if the Tax Administrator receives notice that any Class V Certificate is held through a nominee, the Tax Administrator will treat such nominee as the "middleman" with respect to such certificate unless it has actual knowledge to the contrary or the Depositor provides the Tax Administrator with the identities of other "middlemen" that are Certificateholders.  The Tax Administrator will report as required under the WHFIT Regulations solely to the extent such information as is reasonably necessary to enable it to do so (and is not in its possession) is provided to the Tax Administrator on a timely basis.  The Tax Administrator will not be liable for any tax reporting penalties that may arise under the WHFIT Regulations as a result of a determination by the IRS that is contrary to the first sentence of this paragraph, the assumption with respect to the Exchangeable Certificates or that the notice received with respect to a Class V Certificate as described above is incorrect.



 (i) The Tax Administrator, in its discretion, will report required WHFIT information using either the cash or accrual method, except to the extent the WHFIT Regulations specifically require a different method.  The Tax Administrator will be under no obligation to determine whether any Certificateholder uses the cash or accrual method.  The Tax Administrator will make available WHFIT information to Certificateholders annually.  In addition, the Tax Administrator will not be responsible or liable for providing subsequently amended, revised or updated information to any Certificateholder, unless requested by the Certificateholder.



 (j) The Tax Administrator shall not be liable for failure to meet the reporting requirements of the WHFIT Regulations nor for any penalties thereunder if such failure is due to:  (i) the lack of reasonably necessary information being provided to the Tax Administrator or (ii) incomplete, inaccurate or untimely information being provided to the Tax Administrator.  Each owner of a class of securities representing, in whole or in part, beneficial ownership of an interest in a WHFIT, by acceptance of its interest in such class of securities, will be deemed to have agreed to provide the Tax Administrator with information regarding any sale of such securities, including the price, amount of proceeds and date of sale.  Absent receipt of such information, and unless informed otherwise by the Depositor, the Tax Administrator will assume there is no secondary market trading of WHFIT interests.



 (k) To the extent required by the WHFIT Regulations, the Tax Administrator will use reasonable efforts to publish on an appropriate website the CUSIPs for the Certificates that represent ownership of a WHFIT.  The CUSIPs so published will represent the Rule 144A CUSIPs. The Tax Administrator will not publish any associated Regulation S CUSIPs. The Tax Administrator will make reasonable good faith efforts to keep the website accurate and updated to the extent CUSIPs have been received.  Absent the receipt of a CUSIP, the Tax Administrator will use a reasonable identifier number in lieu of a CUSIP.  The Tax Administrator will not be liable for investor reporting delays that result from the receipt of inaccurate or untimely CUSIP information.







 Section 10.03 The Depositor, the Master Servicers and the Special Servicers to Cooperate with the Tax Administrator.   (a)  The Depositor shall provide or cause to be provided to the Tax Administrator, within ten (10) days after the Closing Date, all information or data that the Tax Administrator reasonably determines to be relevant for tax purposes as to the valuations and Issue Prices of the Certificates, including the price, yield, prepayment assumption and projected cash flow of the Certificates.



 (b) Each of the Master Servicers and the Special Servicers shall furnish such reports, certifications and information in its possession, and access to such books and records maintained thereby, as may relate to the Certificates or the Trust Fund and as shall be reasonably requested by the Tax Administrator in order to enable it to perform its duties under this Article X.

The Depositor, the Certificate Administrator and the Trustee shall exercise its rights to request delivery of information or other performance under these provisions in reasonable good faith, and shall not exercise any such rights for purposes other than compliance with the Dodd-Frank Act, the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and, in each case, the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder.  The parties to this Agreement acknowledge that interpretations of the requirements of Regulation AB may change over time due to interpretive guidance provided by the Commission or its staff, including guidance provided to the Depositor or other issuers through comments by the Commission on any Exchange Act filings or other filings, and agree to comply with reasonable requests made by the Depositor (or any Other Depositor or Other Trustee of any Other Securitization that includes a Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan) or the Certificate Administrator in reasonable good faith for delivery of information under these provisions on the basis of such evolving interpretations of Regulation AB (to the extent such interpretations require compliance and are not "grandfathered").  In connection with this transaction and any Other Securitization subject to Regulation AB that includes a Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan, subject to the preceding sentence, each of the parties to this Agreement shall cooperate fully with the Depositor and the Certificate Administrator and any Other Depositor or Other Trustee of any Other Securitization subject to Regulation AB that includes a Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan, deliver or make available to the Depositor or the Certificate Administrator (including any of their assignees or designees) (i) any and all information in its possession and necessary in the reasonable good faith determination of the Depositor, the Certificate Administrator or such Other Depositor or Other Trustee, as applicable, to permit the Depositor to comply with the provisions of Regulation AB and (ii) such disclosure relating to the applicable Master Servicer, the applicable Special







 Servicer, the Certificate Administrator, the Trustee, as applicable, or the servicing of the Mortgage Loans (or, if applicable, a related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan), in each case reasonably believed by the Depositor, the Certificate Administrator or the related Other Depositor or the related Other Trustee, as applicable, in good faith to be necessary in order to effect such compliance.  In addition, with respect to each Servicing Function Participant that is a Designated Sub-Servicer of a party to this Agreement, such party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause such Designated Sub-Servicer to deliver or make available to the Depositor or the Certificate Administrator and any such Other Depositor or Other Trustee, as applicable, (including any of their assignees or designees) (i) any and all information in its possession and necessary in the reasonable good faith determination of the Depositor or the Certificate Administrator to permit the Depositor to comply with the provisions of Regulation AB and (ii) such disclosure relating to the Servicing Function Participant or the Servicing of the Mortgage Loans (or, if applicable, the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan), in each case reasonably believed by the Depositor or the Certificate Administrator or the related Other Depositor or related Other Trustee, as applicable, in good faith to be necessary in order to effect such compliance.  Each party to this Agreement shall have a reasonable period of time to comply with any written request made under this Section 11.01, but in any event, shall, upon reasonable advance written request, provide information in sufficient time to allow the Depositor or the Certificate Administrator, as applicable, to satisfy any related filing requirements.



 For purposes of this Article XI, to the extent any party has an obligation to exercise commercially reasonable efforts to cause a third party to perform, such party hereunder shall not be required to bring any legal action against such third party in connection with such obligation.

 proactively solicit or procure from such parties any Form 8-K Disclosure Information; provided that to the extent that the Certificate Administrator is notified of such Reportable Event and it does not receive the necessary Form 8-K Disclosure Information, it shall notify the Depositor that it has not received such information and, provided, further, that the limitation on liability provided by this sentence shall not be applicable if the Reportable Event relates to the Certificate Administrator or any party that the Certificate Administrator has engaged to perform its obligations under this Agreement.  Any reasonable fees assessed and any expenses incurred by the Certificate Administrator in connection with including any Form 8-K Disclosure Information on Form 8-K pursuant to this paragraph shall be reimbursable to the Certificate Administrator out of the Collection Account as an Additional Trust Fund Expense.

After filing with the Commission, the Certificate Administrator will, pursuant to Section 8.12(b), make available on the Certificate Administrator's Website a final executed copy of each Form 8-K prepared and filed by the Certificate Administrator.  The parties to this Agreement acknowledge that the performance by the Certificate Administrator of its duties under this Section 11.10 related to the timely preparation and filing of Form 8-K is contingent upon such parties observing all applicable deadlines in the performance of their duties under this Section 11.10.  The Certificate Administrator shall have no liability for any loss, expense, damage, claim arising out of or with respect to any failure to properly prepare, arrange for execution and/or timely file such Form 8-K, where such failure results from the Certificate Administrator's inability or failure to receive approved Form 8-K Disclosure Information within the applicable timeframes set forth in this Section 11.10 and not resulting from the Certificate Administrator's own negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct (provided that to the extent that the Certificate Administrator is notified of such Reportable Event and it does not receive the necessary Form 8-K Disclosure Information, it will notify the Depositor that it has not received such information and further provided that the limitation on liability provided by this sentence shall not be applicable if the Reportable Event relates to the Certificate Administrator or any party that the Certificate Administrator has engaged to perform its obligations under this Agreement).

 (b) If the Certificate Administrator is unable to timely file with the Commission all or any required portion of any Form 8-K, Form 10-D or Form 10-K required to be filed by this Agreement because required disclosure information either was not delivered to it or was delivered to it after the delivery deadlines set forth in this Agreement or for any other reason, the Certificate Administrator shall promptly notify (which notice (which may be sent by fax or by email notwithstanding the provisions of Section 12.05) shall include the identity of those Reporting Servicers who either did not deliver such information or delivered such information to it after the delivery deadlines set forth in this Agreement) the Depositor and each Reporting Servicer that failed to make such delivery.  In the case of Form 10-D and Form 10-K, each such Reporting Servicer shall cooperate with the Depositor and the Certificate Administrator to prepare and file a Form 12b-25 and a Form 10-D/A and Form 10-K/A as applicable, pursuant to Rule 12b-25 under the Exchange Act.

Any Form 12b-25 or any amendment to Form 8-K, Form 10-D or Form 10-K shall be signed by the Depositor.  The parties to this Agreement acknowledge that the performance by the Certificate Administrator of its duties under this Section 11.11 related to the timely preparation and filing of a Form 12b-25 or any amendment to Form 8-K, 10-D or 10-K is contingent upon the Master Servicers, the Special Servicers and the Depositor performing their duties under this Section.  The Certificate Administrator shall have no liability for any loss, expense, damage, claim arising out of or with respect to any failure to properly prepare and/or timely file any such Form 12b-25 or any amendments to Forms 8-K, Form 10-D or Form 10-K, where such failure results from the Certificate Administrator's inability or failure to receive, on a timely basis, any information from any other party hereto needed to prepare, arrange for execution or file such Form 12b-25 or any amendments to Form 8-K, Form 10-D or Form 10-K, not resulting from its own negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct.

 The Master Servicers, the Special Servicers, the Certificate Administrator, the Trustee and the Trust Advisor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause each related Servicing Function Participant (other than any party to this Agreement) with which it has entered into a servicing relationship with respect to the Mortgage Loans, to indemnify and hold harmless the Certification Parties from and against any losses, damages, penalties, fines, forfeitures, legal fees and expenses and related costs, judgments and other costs and expenses incurred by such Certification Party arising out of a breach of its obligations to provide any of the annual compliance statements or annual assessment of servicing criteria or attestation reports pursuant to this Agreement, or the applicable Sub-Servicing Agreement or primary servicing agreement, as applicable.



 If the indemnification provided for herein is unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless any Certification Party, then the Master Servicers, the Special Servicers, the Certificate Administrator, the Trustee, the Trust Advisor, each Additional Servicer or other Servicing Function Participant (the "Performing Party") shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause each Servicing Function Participant (other than any party to this Agreement) with which it has entered into a servicing relationship with respect to the Mortgage Loans, to contribute to the amount paid or payable to the Certification Party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities of the Certification Party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the Certification Party on the one hand and the Performing Party on the other in connection with a breach of the Performing Party's obligations pursuant to this Article XI.  The Master Servicers, the Special Servicers, the Certificate Administrator, the Trust Advisor and the Trustee







 shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause each related Servicing Function Participant (other than any party to this Agreement) with which it has entered into a servicing relationship with respect to the Mortgage Loans to agree to the foregoing indemnification and contribution obligations.



 Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party hereunder, notify in writing the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof; but the omission to so notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party under this Agreement except to the extent that such omission to notify materially prejudices the indemnifying party.  In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party, after the indemnifying party has been notified of the commencement of such action, such indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein (at its own expense) and, to the extent that it may wish, shall be entitled to assume the defense thereof (jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified) with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), and after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election to so assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party for any expenses subsequently incurred in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation.  In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have agreed to the retention of such counsel, (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them or (iii) the indemnifying party fails, within a reasonable period of time, to designate counsel that is reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).  In no event shall the indemnifying parties be liable for fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) in any one jurisdiction separate from their own counsel for all indemnified parties in connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances.  An indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent.  However, if settled with such consent, the indemnifying party shall indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement to the extent that the indemnifying party is otherwise required to do so under this Agreement.  If an indemnifying party assumes the defense of any proceeding, it shall be entitled to settle such proceeding with the consent of the indemnified party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) or, if such settlement (i) provides for an unconditional release of the indemnified party in connection with all matters relating to the proceeding that have been asserted against the indemnified party in such proceeding by the other parties to such settlement and (ii) does not require an admission of fault by the indemnified party, without the consent of the indemnified party.

 A "Permitted Transferee" is any Transferee other than a "Disqualified Organization", a "Disqualified Non-United States Tax Person" or a "Disqualified Partnership" (each as defined in the Agreement) and other than a foreign permanent establishment or fixed







 base (each within the meaning of any applicable income tax treaty) of a United States Tax Person or any other Person as to whom the transfer of this Certificate may cause any REMIC Pool to fail to qualify as a REMIC at any time that any Certificate is outstanding.



 As provided in the Agreement and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of this Certificate is registrable in the Certificate Register upon surrender of this Certificate for registration of transfer at the offices of the Certificate Registrar, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in the form satisfactory to the Certificate Registrar duly executed by, the Holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Certificates of the same Class in authorized denominations evidencing the same aggregate Percentage Interest will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.

 (To Issuer Letter of Representations)



 SAMPLE OFFERING DOCUMENT LANGUAGE

 DESCRIBING BOOK-ENTRY-ONLY ISSUANCE

 (Prepared by DTC--bracketed material may be applicable only to certain issues)



 1.           The Depository Trust Company ("DTC"), New York, NY, will act as securities depository for the securities (the "Securities"). The Securities will be issued as fully-registered securities registered in the name of Cede & Co. (DTC's partnership nominee) or such other name as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC.   One fully-registered Security certificate will be issued for [each issue of] the Securities, [each] in the aggregate principal amount of such issue, and will be deposited with DTC.  [If, however, the aggregate principal amount of [any] issue exceeds $500 million, one certificate will be issued with respect to each $500 million of principal amount, and an additional certificate will be issued with respect to any remaining principal amount of such issue.]



 2.           DTC, the world's largest securities depository, is a limited-purpose trust company organized under the New York Banking Law, a "banking organization" within the meaning of the New York Banking Law, a member of the Federal Reserve System, a "clearing corporation" within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code, and a "clearing agency" registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. DTC holds and provides asset servicing for over 3.5 million issues of UxxPDSxxPD and non-UxxPDSxxPD equity issues, corporate and municipal debt issues, and money market instruments (from over 100 countries) that DTC's participants ("Direct Participants") deposit with DTC. DTC also facilitates the post-trade settlement among Direct Participants of sales and other securities transactions in deposited securities, through electronic computerized book-entry transfers and pledges between Direct Participants' accounts. This eliminates the need for physical movement of securities certificates. Direct Participants include both UxxPDSxxPD and non-UxxPDSxxPD securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations, and certain other organizations. DTC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation ("DTCC"). DTCC is the holding company for DTC, National Securities Clearing Corporation and Fixed Income Clearing Corporation, all of which are registered clearing agencies. DTCC is owned by the users of its regulated subsidiaries. Access to the DTC system is also available to others such as both UxxPDSxxPD and non-UxxPDSxxPD securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, and clearing corporations that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Direct Participant, either directly or indirectly ("Indirect Participants"). DTC has a Standard & Poor's rating of AA+.  The DTC Rules applicable to its Participants are on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

 3.           Purchases of Securities under the DTC system must be made by or through Direct Participants, which will receive a credit for the Securities on DTC's records. The ownership interest of each actual purchaser of each Security ("Beneficial Owner ") is in turn to be recorded on the Direct and Indirect Participants' records.  Beneficial Owners will not receive written confirmation from DTC of their purchase. Beneficial Owners are, however, expected to receive written confirmations providing details of the transaction, as well as periodic statements of their holdings, from the Direct or Indirect Participant through which the Beneficial Owner entered into the transaction.  Transfers of ownership interests in the Securities are to be accomplished by entries made on the books of Direct and Indirect Participants acting on behalf of Beneficial Owners. Beneficial Owners will not receive certificates representing their ownership interests in Securities, except in the event that use of the book-entry system for the Securities is discontinued.



 4.           To facilitate subsequent transfers, all Securities deposited by Direct Participants with DTC are registered in the name of DTC's partnership nominee, Cede & Co., or such other name as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC. The deposit of Securities with DTC and their registration in the name of Cede & Co. or such other DTC nominee do not effect any change in beneficial ownership. DTC has no knowledge of the actual Beneficial Owners of the Securities; DTC's records reflect only the identity of the Direct Participants to whose accounts such Securities are credited, which may or may not be the Beneficial Owners. The Direct and Indirect Participants will remain responsible for keeping account of their holdings on behalf of their customers.

(To Issuer Letter of Representations)



 5.           Conveyance of notices and other communications by DTC to Direct Participants, by Direct Participants to Indirect Participants, and by Direct Participants and Indirect Participants to Beneficial Owners will be governed by arrangements among them, subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements as may be in effect from time to time. [Beneficial Owners of Securities may wish to take certain steps to augment the transmission to them of notices of significant events with respect to the Securities, such as redemptions, tenders, defaults, and proposed amendments to the Security documents. For example, Beneficial Owners of Securities may wish to ascertain that the nominee holding the Securities for their benefit has agreed to obtain and transmit notices to Beneficial Owners. In the alternative, Beneficial Owners may wish to provide their names and addresses to the registrar and request that copies of notices be provided directly to them.]



 [6.           Redemption notices shall be sent to DTC. If less than all of the Securities within an issue are being redeemed, DTC's practice is to determine by lot the amount of the interest of each Direct Participant in such issue to be redeemed.]



 7.           Neither DTC nor Cede & Co. (nor any other DTC nominee) will consent or vote with respect to Securities unless authorized by a Direct Participant in accordance with DTC's MMI Procedures.  Under its usual procedures, DTC mails an Omnibus Proxy to Issuer as soon as possible alter the record date. The Omnibus Proxy assigns Cede & Co.'s consenting or voting rights to those Direct Participants to whose accounts Securities are credited on the record date (identified in a listing attached to the Omnibus Proxy).



 8.           Redemption proceeds, distributions, and dividend payments on the Securities will be made to Cede & Co., or such other nominee as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC. DTC's practice is to credit Direct Participants' accounts upon DTC's receipt of funds and corresponding detail information from Issuer or Agent, on payable date in accordance with their respective holdings shown on DTC's records. Payments by Participants to Beneficial Owners will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices, as is the case with securities held for the accounts of customers in bearer form or registered in "street name," and will be the responsibility of such Participant and not of DTC, Agent, or Issuer, subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements as may be in effect from time to time. Payment of redemption proceeds, distributions, and dividend payments to Cede & Co. (or such other nominee as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC) is the responsibility of Issuer or Agent, disbursement of such payments to Direct Participants will be the responsibility of DTC, and disbursement of such payments to the Beneficial Owners will be the responsibility of Direct and Indirect Participants.



 [9.           A Beneficial Owner shall give notice to elect to have its Securities purchased or tendered, through its Participant, to [Tender/Remarketing] Agent, and shall effect delivery of such Securities by causing the Direct Participant to transfer the Participant's interest in the Securities, on DTC's records, to [Tender/Remarketing] Agent.  The requirement for physical delivery of Securities in connection with an optional tender or a mandatory purchase will be deemed satisfied when the ownership rights in the Securities are transferred by Direct Participants on DTC's records and followed by a book-entry credit of tendered Securities to [Tender/Remarketing] Agent's DTC amount.]



 10.        DTC may discontinue providing its services as depository with respect to the Securities at any time by giving reasonable notice to Issuer or Agent.  Under such circumstances, in the event that a successor depository is not obtained, Security certificates are required to be printed and delivered.



 11.         Issuer may decide to discontinue use of the system of book-entry-only transfers through DTC (or a successor securities depository).  In that event, Security certificates will be printed and delivered to DTC.



 12.         The information in this section concerning DTC and DTC's book-entry system has been obtained from sources that Issuer believes to be reliable, but Issuer takes no responsibility for the accuracy thereof.

 Ladies and Gentlemen:

 To induce DTC to accept the Securities as eligible for deposit at DTC, and to act in accordance with DTC's Rules with respect to the Securities, Issuer represents to DTC that Issuer will comply with the requirements stated in DTC's Operational Arrangements, as they may be amended from time to time.

 SAMPLE OFFERING DOCUMENT LANGUAGE

 DESCRIBING BOOK-ENTRY-ONLY ISSUANCE

 (Prepared by DTC--bracketed material may be applicable only to certain issues)



 1.           The Depository Trust Company ("DTC"), New York, NY, will act as securities depository for the securities (the "Securities"). The Securities will be issued as fully-registered securities registered in the name of Cede & Co. (DTC's partnership nominee) or such other name as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC.   One fully-registered Security certificate will be issued for [each issue of] the Securities, [each] in the aggregate principal amount of such issue, and will be deposited with DTC.  [If, however, the aggregate principal amount of [any] issue exceeds $500 million, one certificate will be issued with respect to each $500 million of principal amount, and an additional certificate will be issued with respect to any remaining principal amount of such issue.]



 2.           DTC, the world's largest securities depository, is a limited-purpose trust company organized under the New York Banking Law, a "banking organization" within the meaning of the New York Banking Law, a member of the Federal Reserve System, a "clearing corporation" within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code, and a "clearing agency" registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. DTC holds and provides asset servicing for over 3.5 million issues of UxxPDSxxPD and non-UxxPDSxxPD equity issues, corporate and municipal debt issues, and money market instruments (from over 100 countries) that DTC's participants ("Direct Participants") deposit with DTC. DTC also facilitates the post-trade settlement among Direct Participants of sales and other securities transactions in deposited securities, through electronic computerized book-entry transfers and pledges between Direct Participants' accounts. This eliminates the need for physical movement of securities certificates. Direct Participants include both UxxPDSxxPD and non-UxxPDSxxPD securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations, and certain other organizations. DTC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation ("DTCC"). DTCC is the holding company for DTC, National Securities Clearing Corporation and Fixed Income Clearing Corporation, all of which are registered clearing agencies. DTCC is owned by the users of its regulated subsidiaries. Access to the DTC system is also available to others such as both UxxPDSxxPD and non-UxxPDSxxPD securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, and clearing corporations that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Direct Participant, either directly or indirectly ("Indirect Participants"). DTC has a Standard & Poor's rating of AA+.  The DTC Rules applicable to its Participants are on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. More information about DTC can be found at www.dtcc.com.



 3.           Purchases of Securities under the DTC system must be made by or through Direct Participants, which will receive a credit for the Securities on DTC's records. The ownership interest of each actual purchaser of each Security ("Beneficial Owner ") is in turn to be recorded on the Direct and Indirect Participants' records.  Beneficial Owners will not receive written confirmation from DTC of their purchase. Beneficial Owners are, however, expected to receive written confirmations providing details of the transaction, as well as periodic statements of their holdings, from the Direct or Indirect Participant through which the Beneficial Owner entered into the transaction.  Transfers of ownership interests in the Securities are to be accomplished by entries made on the books of Direct and Indirect Participants acting on behalf of Beneficial Owners. Beneficial Owners will not receive certificates representing their ownership interests in Securities, except in the event that use of the book-entry system for the Securities is discontinued.



 4.           To facilitate subsequent transfers, all Securities deposited by Direct Participants with DTC are registered in the name of DTC's partnership nominee, Cede & Co., or such other name as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC. The deposit of Securities with DTC and their registration in the name of Cede & Co. or such other DTC nominee do not effect any change in beneficial ownership. DTC has no knowledge of the actual Beneficial Owners of the Securities; DTC's records reflect only the identity of the Direct Participants to whose accounts such Securities are credited, which may or may not be the Beneficial Owners. The Direct and Indirect Participants will remain responsible for keeping account of their holdings on behalf of their customers.

Conveyance of notices and other communications by DTC to Direct Participants, by Direct Participants to Indirect Participants, and by Direct Participants and Indirect Participants to Beneficial Owners will be governed by arrangements among them, subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements as may be in effect from time to time. [Beneficial Owners of Securities may wish to take certain steps to augment the transmission to them of notices of significant events with respect to the Securities, such as redemptions, tenders, defaults, and proposed amendments to the Security documents. For example, Beneficial Owners of Securities may wish to ascertain that the nominee holding the Securities for their benefit has agreed to obtain and transmit notices to Beneficial Owners. In the alternative, Beneficial Owners may wish to provide their names and addresses to the registrar and request that copies of notices be provided directly to them.]

(nor any other DTC nominee) will consent or vote with respect to Securities unless authorized by a Direct Participant in accordance with DTC's MMI Procedures.  Under its usual procedures, DTC mails an Omnibus Proxy to Issuer as soon as possible alter the record date. The Omnibus Proxy assigns Cede & Co.'s consenting or voting rights to those Direct Participants to whose accounts Securities are credited on the record date (identified in a listing attached to the Omnibus Proxy).



 8.           Redemption proceeds, distributions, and dividend payments on the Securities will be made to Cede & Co., or such other nominee as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC. DTC's practice is to credit Direct Participants' accounts upon DTC's receipt of funds and corresponding detail information from Issuer or Agent, on payable date in accordance with their respective holdings shown on DTC's records. Payments by Participants to Beneficial Owners will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices, as is the case with securities held for the accounts of customers in bearer form or registered in "street name," and will be the responsibility of such Participant and not of DTC, Agent, or Issuer, subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements as may be in effect from time to time. Payment of redemption proceeds, distributions, and dividend payments to Cede & Co. (or such other nominee as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC) is the responsibility of Issuer or Agent, disbursement of such payments to Direct Participants will be the responsibility of DTC, and disbursement of such payments to the Beneficial Owners will be the responsibility of Direct and Indirect Participants.



 [9.           A Beneficial Owner shall give notice to elect to have its Securities purchased or tendered, through its Participant, to [Tender/Remarketing] Agent, and shall effect delivery of such Securities by causing the Direct Participant to transfer the Participant's interest in the Securities, on DTC's records, to [Tender/Remarketing] Agent.  The requirement for physical delivery of Securities in connection with an optional tender or a mandatory purchase will be deemed satisfied when the ownership rights in the Securities are transferred by Direct Participants on DTC's records and followed by a book-entry credit of tendered Securities to [Tender/Remarketing] Agent's DTC amount.]



 10.        DTC may discontinue providing its services as depository with respect to the Securities at any time by giving reasonable notice to Issuer or Agent.  Under such circumstances, in the event that a successor depository is not obtained, Security certificates are required to be printed and delivered.



 11.         Issuer may decide to discontinue use of the system of book-entry-only transfers through DTC (or a successor securities depository).  In that event, Security certificates will be printed and delivered to DTC.



 12.         The information in this section concerning DTC and DTC's book-entry system has been obtained from sources that Issuer believes to be reliable, but Issuer takes no responsibility for the accuracy thereof.

 Ladies and Gentlemen:



 This letter is delivered to you in connection with the transfer by __________ (the "Transferor") to _________ (the "Transferee") of the Transferred Certificates.  The Certificates, including the Transferred Certificates, were issued pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement dated as of March 1, 2014 (the "Pooling and Servicing Agreement"), among RBS Commercial Funding Inc., as Depositor (the "Depositor"), Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as General Master Servicer, NCB, FSB, as NCB Master Servicer, LNR Partners, LLC, as General Special Servicer, NCB, FSB, as Co-op Special Servicer, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Certificate Administrator, as Tax Administrator and as Custodian, Trimont Real Estate Advisors, Inc., as Trust Advisor, and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as Trustee.

 1.           The Transferor is the lawful owner of the Transferred Certificates with the full right to transfer such Certificates free from any and all claims and encumbrances whatsoever.



 2.           Neither the Transferor nor anyone acting on its behalf has (a) offered, sold, pledged or otherwise transferred any Transferred Certificate, any interest in any Transferred Certificate or any other similar security to any person in any manner, (b) solicited any offer to buy or accept a pledge or other transfer of any Transferred Certificate, any interest in any Transferred Certificate or any other similar security from any person in any manner, (c) otherwise approached or negotiated with respect to any Transferred Certificate, any interest in any Transferred Certificate or any other similar security with any person in any manner, (d) made any general solicitation with respect to

 any Transferred Certificate, any interest in a Transferred Certificate or any other similar security by means of general advertising or in any other manner or (e) taken any other action with respect to any Transferred Certificate, any interest in a Transferred Certificate or any other similar security, which (in the case of any of the acts described in clauses (a) through (e) hereof) would constitute a distribution of any Transferred Certificate under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), would render the offer, sale, pledge or other transfer of any Transferred Certificate a violation of Section 5 of the Securities Act or any applicable state or foreign securities laws, or would require registration or qualification of any Transferred Certificate pursuant to the Securities Act or any applicable state or foreign securities laws.  The Transferor will not act, nor has it authorized or will it authorize any person to act, in any manner set forth in the foregoing sentence with respect to any Transferred Certificate, any interest in any Transferred Certificate or any other similar security.



 3.           The Transferor and any person acting on behalf of the Transferor in this matter reasonably believe that the Transferee is a "qualified institutional buyer" (a "Qualified Institutional Buyer") as that term is defined in Rule 144A ("Rule 144A") under the Securities Act, purchasing for its own account or for the account of another person that is itself a Qualified Institutional Buyer.  In determining whether the Transferee is a Qualified Institutional Buyer, the Transferor and any person acting on behalf of the Transferor in this matter have relied upon the following method(s) of establishing the Transferee's ownership and discretionary investments of securities (check one or more):



        ____   (a)   The Transferee's most recent publicly available financial statements, which statements present the information as of a date within 16 months preceding the date of sale of the Transferred Certificates in the case of a UxxPDSxxPD purchaser and within 18 months preceding such date of sale for a foreign purchaser; or



        ____   (b)   The most recent publicly available information appearing in documents filed by the Transferee with the Securities and Exchange Commission or another United States federal, state, or local governmental agency or self-regulatory organization, or with a foreign governmental agency or self-regulatory organization, which information is as of a date within 16 months preceding the date of sale of the Transferred Certificates in the case of a UxxPDSxxPD purchaser and within 18 months preceding such date of sale for a foreign purchaser; or



        ____   (c)   The most recent publicly available information appearing in a recognized securities manual, which information is as of a date within 16 months preceding the date of sale of the Transferred Certificates in the case of a UxxPDSxxPD purchaser and within 18 months preceding such date of sale for a foreign purchaser; or



        ____   (d)   A certification by the chief financial officer, a person fulfilling an equivalent function, or other executive officer of the Transferee,



 C-2A-2



        specifying the amount of securities owned and invested on a discretionary basis by the Transferee as of a specific date on or since the close of the Transferee's most recent fiscal year, or, in the case of a Transferee that is a member of a "family of investment companies", as that term is defined in Rule 144A(a)(1)(iv), a certification by an executive officer of the investment adviser specifying the amount of securities owned by the "family of investment companies" as of a specific date on or since the close of the Transferee's most recent fiscal year.



 4.           The Transferor and any person acting on behalf of the Transferor understand that in determining the aggregate amount of securities owned and invested on a discretionary basis by an entity for purposes of establishing whether such entity is a Qualified Institutional Buyer:



 (a)           the following instruments and interests shall be excluded:  securities of issuers that are affiliated with such entity; securities that are part of an unsold allotment to or subscription by such entity, if such entity is a dealer; securities of issuers that are part of such entity's "family of investment companies", if such entity is a registered investment company; bank deposit notes and certificates of deposit; loan participations; repurchase agreements; securities owned but subject to a repurchase agreement; and currency, interest rate and commodity swaps;



 (b)           the aggregate value of the securities shall be the cost of such securities, except where the entity reports its securities holdings in its financial statements on the basis of their market value, and no current information with respect to the cost of those securities has been published, in which case the securities may be valued at market;



 (c)           securities owned by subsidiaries of the entity that are consolidated with the entity in its financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles may be included if the investments of such subsidiaries are managed under the direction of the entity, except that, unless the entity is a reporting company under Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, securities owned by such subsidiaries may not be included if the entity itself is a majority-owned subsidiary that would be included in the consolidated financial statements of another enterprise.



 5.           The Transferor or a person acting on its behalf has taken reasonable steps to ensure that the Transferee is aware that the Transferor is relying on the exemption from the provisions of Section 5 of the Securities Act provided by Rule 144A.

The Transferor or a person acting on its behalf has furnished, or caused to be furnished, to the Transferee all information regarding (a) the parties to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, (b) the Transferred Certificates and distributions thereon, (c) the nature, performance and servicing of the Mortgage Loans, (d) the Trust and Trust Fund,

 C-2B-3

        ___   Other.  (Please supply a brief description of the entity and a cross-reference to the paragraph and subparagraph under subsection (a)(1) of Rule 144A pursuant to which it qualifies.  Note that registered investment companies should complete Annex 2 rather than this Annex 1.)



 3.           For purposes of determining the aggregate amount of securities owned and/or invested on a discretionary basis by any Person, the Transferee did not include (i) securities of issuers that are affiliated with such Person, (ii) securities that are part of an unsold allotment to or subscription by such Person, if such Person is a dealer,



 C-2B-4

 5.           The Transferee is familiar with Rule 144A and understands that the Transferor and other parties related to the Transferred Certificates are relying and will continue to rely on the statements made herein because one or more Transfers to the Transferee may be in reliance on Rule 144A.



 ___           ___           Will the Transferee be acquiring interests in the Transferred

 Yes           No             Certificates only for the Transferee's own account?



 6.           If the answer to the foregoing question is "no", then in each case where the Transferee is acquiring any interest in a Transferred Certificate for an account other than its own, such account belongs to a third party that is itself a "qualified institutional buyer" within the meaning of Rule 144A, and the "qualified institutional buyer" status of such third party has been established by the Transferee through one or more of the appropriate methods contemplated by Rule 144A.



 7.           The Transferee will notify each of the parties to which this certification is made of any changes in the information and conclusions herein.  Until such notice is given, the Transferee's acquisition of any interest in the Transferred Certificates will constitute a reaffirmation of this certification as of the date of such acquisition.  In addition, if the Transferee is a bank or savings and loan as provided above, the Transferee agrees that it will furnish to such parties any updated annual financial statements that become available on or before the date of such acquisition, promptly after they become available.

As indicated below, the undersigned is the chief financial officer, a person fulfilling an equivalent function, or other executive officer of the entity acquiring interests in the Transferred Certificates (the "Transferee") or, if the Transferee is a "qualified institutional buyer" as that term is defined in Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended ("Rule 144A") because the Transferee is part of a Family of Investment Companies (as defined in paragraph 3 below), is an executive officer of the investment adviser (the "Adviser").



 2.           The Transferee is a "qualified institutional buyer" as defined in Rule 144A because (i) the Transferee is an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, and (ii) as marked below, the Transferee alone owned and/or invested on a discretionary basis, or the Transferee's Family of Investment Companies owned, at least $100,000,000, in securities (other than the excluded securities referred to in paragraph 4 below) as of the end of the Transferee's most recent fiscal year.  For purposes of determining the amount of securities owned by the Transferee or the Transferee's Family of Investment Companies, the cost of such securities was used, unless the Transferee or any member of the Transferee's Family of Investment Companies, as the case may be, reports its securities holdings in its financial statements on the basis of their market value, and no current information with respect to the cost of those securities has been published, in which case the securities of such entity were valued at market.



        ___   The Transferee owned and/or invested on a discretionary basis $____ in securities (other than the excluded securities referred to below) as of the end of the Transferee's most recent fiscal year (such amount being calculated in accordance with Rule 144A).



        ___   The Transferee is part of a Family of Investment Companies which owned in the aggregate $____ in securities (other than the excluded securities referred to below) as of the end of the Transferee's most recent fiscal year (such amount being calculated in accordance with Rule 144A).



 3.           The term "Family of Investment Companies" as used herein means two or more registered investment companies (or series thereof) that have the same investment adviser or investment advisers that are affiliated (by virtue of being majority-owned



 C-2B-7



 subsidiaries of the same parent or because one investment adviser is a majority-owned subsidiary of the other).



 4.           The term "securities" as used herein does not include (i) securities of issuers that are affiliated with the Transferee or are part of the Transferee's Family of Investment Companies, (ii) bank deposit notes and certificates of deposit, (iii) loan participations, (iv) repurchase agreements, (v) securities owned but subject to a repurchase agreement, and (vi) currency, interest rate and commodity swaps.  For purposes of determining the aggregate amount of securities owned and/or invested on a discretionary basis by the Transferee, or owned by the Transferee's Family of Investment Companies, the securities referred to in this paragraph were excluded.



 5.           The Transferee is familiar with Rule 144A and understands that the Transferor and other parties related to the Transferred Certificates are relying and will continue to rely on the statements made herein because one or more Transfers to the Transferee will be in reliance on Rule 144A.



 ___           ___           Will the Transferee be acquiring interests in the Transferred

 Yes           No           Certificates only for the Transferee's own account?



 6.           If the answer to the foregoing question is "no", then in each case where the Transferee is acquiring any interest in the Transferred Certificates for an account other than its own, such account belongs to a third party that is itself a "qualified institutional buyer" within the meaning of Rule 144A, and the "qualified institutional buyer" status of such third party has been established by the Transferee through one or more of the appropriate methods contemplated by Rule 144A.



 7.           The undersigned will notify the parties to which this certification is made of any changes in the information and conclusions herein.  Until such notice, the Transferee's acquisition of any interest in the Transferred Certificates will constitute a reaffirmation of this certification by the undersigned as of the date of such acquisition.

 2.           The Purchaser is acquiring Class R Certificates representing [___]% of the residual interest in each of the real estate mortgage investment conduits (each, a ''REMIC'') designated as ''REMIC I'', "REMIC II" and "REMIC III", respectively, relating to the Certificates for which an election has been or is to be made under Section 860D of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the "Code").



 3.           The Purchaser is a Permitted Transferee (as defined in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement) and the Purchaser's UxxPDSxxPD taxpayer identification number is __________.  The Purchaser is not a "Disqualified Organization", and that the Purchaser is not acquiring the Class R Certificates for the account of, or as agent or nominee of, or with a view to the transfer of direct or indirect record or beneficial ownership thereof, to a person that is not a Permitted Transferee or to a Disqualified Organization.  For the purposes hereof, a Disqualified Organization is any of the following:  (i) the United States or a possession thereof, any State or any political subdivision thereof, or any agency or instrumentality of any of the foregoing (other than an instrumentality which is a corporation if all of its activities are subject to tax and, except for the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, a majority of its board of directors is not selected by any such governmental unit), (ii) a foreign government, international organization, or







 any agency or instrumentality of either of the foregoing, (iii) any organization (except certain farmers' cooperatives described in Section 521 of the Code) which is exempt from the tax imposed by Chapter 1 of the Code (unless such organization is subject to the tax imposed by Section 511 of the Code on unrelated business taxable income), (iv) rural electric and telephone cooperatives described in Section 1381 of the Code or (v) any other Person so designated by the Tax Administrator, based upon an Opinion of Counsel delivered to the Tax Administrator (but not at the Tax Administrator's expense) to the effect that the holding of an Ownership Interest in a Class R Certificate by such Person may cause the Trust or any Person having an Ownership Interest in any Class of Certificates, other than such Person, to incur a liability for any federal tax imposed under the Code that would not otherwise be imposed but for the Transfer of an Ownership Interest in a Class R Certificate to such Person.  The terms "United States", "State" and "international organization" shall have the meanings set forth in Section 7701 of the Code or successor provisions.



 4.           The Purchaser is not a foreign permanent establishment or a fixed base (within the meaning of any applicable income tax treaty between the United States and any foreign jurisdiction) of a United States Tax Person.

The Purchaser will not cause the income from the Class R Certificates to be attributable to a foreign permanent establishment or fixed base (within the meaning of any applicable income tax treaty between the United States and any foreign jurisdiction) of a United States Tax Person.



 6.           The Purchaser acknowledges that Section 860E(e) of the Code would impose a substantial tax on the transferor or, in certain circumstances, on an agent for the transferee, with respect to any transfer of any interest in any Class R Certificates to a Disqualified Organization.



 7.           No purpose of the acquisition of the Class R Certificates is to impede the assessment or collection of tax.

 Ladies and Gentlemen:



 This letter is delivered to you in connection with the transfer by _________________ (the "Transferor") to _________________ (the "Transferee") of the Transferred Certificates pursuant to Section 5.02 of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement (the "Pooling and Servicing Agreement"), dated as of March 1, 2014 among RBS Commercial Funding Inc., as Depositor, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as General Master Servicer, NCB, FSB, as NCB Master Servicer, LNR Partners, LLC, as General Special Servicer, NCB, FSB, as Co-op Special Servicer, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Certificate Administrator, as Tax Administrator and as Custodian, Trimont Real Estate Advisors, Inc., as Trust Advisor, and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as Trustee.  All capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined shall have the respective meanings set forth in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.  The Transferor hereby certifies, represents and warrants to you as Certificate Registrar, as follows:



 1.           No purpose of the Transferor relating to the transfer of the Residual Interest Certificates by the Transferor to the Transferee is or will be to impede the assessment or collection of any tax.



 2.           The Transferor understands that the Transferee has delivered to you a Transfer Affidavit and Agreement in the form attached to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement as Exhibit E-1.  The Transferor does not know or believe that any representation contained therein is false.



 3.           The Transferor has at the time of this transfer conducted a reasonable investigation of the financial condition of the Transferee (or the beneficial owners of the Transferee if the Transferee is classified as a partnership under the Code) as contemplated by Treasury Regulation Section 1.860E-1(c)(4)(i) and, as a result of that investigation, the Transferor has determined that the Transferee has historically paid its debts as they became due







 and has found no significant evidence to indicate that the Transferee will not continue to pay its debts as they become due in the future.  The Transferor understands that the transfer of the Residual Interest Certificates may not be respected for United States income tax purposes (and the Transferor may continue to be liable for United States income taxes associated therewith) unless the Transferor has conducted such an investigation.

 W-8



 (as defined in the Loan Documents) under the Loan, except that under no conditions shall clause (i) (with respect to increase principal amount only), or clause (viii) be modified without the written consent of Subordinated Lender.  In addition and notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 2, any amounts funded by the Lender under the Loan Documents as a result of (A) the making of any protective advances or other advances by the Lender, or (B) interest accruals or accretions and any compounding thereof (including default interest), shall not be deemed to contravene this Section 2.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if an Event of Default exists under the Subordinated Loan Documents, Subordinated Lender shall be permitted to modify or amend the Subordinated Loan Documents in connection with a work out or other surrender, compromise, release, renewal or modification of the Subordinated Loan except that under no conditions shall clause (i), with respect to increases in principal amounts only, clause (ii), clause (iii) (with respect to shortening the maturity only), clause (iv) or clause (v) be modified without the written consent of the Lender.  In addition and notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 6(b), any amounts funded by the Subordinated Lender under the Subordinated Loan Documents as a result of (A) the making of any Protective Advances or other advances by the Subordinated Lender, or (B) interest accruals or accretions and any compounding thereof (including default interest), shall not be deemed to contravene this Section 6(b).



 (c)           Lender shall deliver to Subordinated Lender copies of any and all modifications, amendments, extensions, consolidations, spreaders, restatements, alterations, changes or revisions to any one or more of the Loan Documents (including, without limitation, any side letters, waivers or consents entered into, executed or delivered by Lender) within a reasonable time after any of such applicable instruments have been executed by Lender.



 (d)           Subordinated Lender shall deliver to Lender copies of any and all modifications, amendments, extensions, consolidations, spreaders, restatements, alterations,



 W-9



 changes or revisions to any one or more of the Subordinated Loan Documents (including, without limitation, any side letters, waivers or consents entered into, executed or delivered by Subordinated Lender) within a reasonable time after any of such applicable instruments have been executed by Subordinated Lender.



 5.           Default Notice.



 (a)           Subordinated Lender shall give Lender notice of any default under the Subordinated Loan Documents promptly upon the giving of such notice of default to Borrower and in all instances prior to accelerating the Subordinated Loan on account of such default.  Lender may, but shall not be obligated to, cure any such default, in which event Subordinated Lender shall accept such cure by Lender as and for the cure by Borrower.



 (b)           Lender shall give Subordinated Lender notice of any default under the Loan Documents promptly upon the giving of such notice of default to Borrower and in all instances prior to accelerating the Loan on account of such default.  Subordinated Lender may, but shall not be obligated to, cure any such default, in which event Lender shall accept such cure by Subordinated Lender as and for the cure by Borrower.



 6.           Casualty and Condemnation.  In the event of a casualty to the buildings or improvements constructed on any portion of the Project or a condemnation or taking under a power of eminent domain of all or any portion of the Project, Lender shall have a first and prior interest in and to any payments, awards, proceeds, distributions, or consideration arising from any such event (the "Award").  Subordinated Lender acknowledges and agrees that so long as the Loan is outstanding, it has no lien on or security interest in any Award, nor any rights with respect to any Award except as expressly provided in this Agreement, and Subordinated Lender assigns its rights to any Award to Lender up to an amount equal to the then outstanding amount of the Loan.  Subordinated Lender agrees to promptly, upon request by Lender, execute and deliver to Lender and/or to any other party as so directed by Lender, a written confirmation of the terms set forth in the immediately preceding sentence and take sure other actions reasonably requested by Lender to further evidence the foregoing agreement (although failure of Subordinated Lender to do so shall not affect the foregoing agreement).  If the amount of the Award is in excess of all amounts owed to Lender under the Loan Documents, however, and either the Loan has been paid in full or Borrower is entitled to a remittance of same under the Loan Documents other than to restore the Project, such excess Award or portion to be so remitted to Borrower shall, to the extent permitted in the Loan Documents and required by the Subordinated Loan Documents, be paid to or at the direction of Subordinated Lender, unless other Persons have claimed the right to such awards or proceeds, in which case Lender shall only be required to provide notice to Subordinated Lender of such excess Award and of any other claims thereto.  In the event of any competing claims for any such excess Award, Lender shall continue to hold such excess Award until Lender receives an agreement signed by all Persons making a claim to the excess Award or a final order of a court of competent jurisdiction directing Lender as to how and to which Person(s) the excess Award is to be distributed.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of a casualty or condemnation, Lender shall release the Award from any such event to the Borrower if and to the extent required by the terms and conditions of the Loan Documents in order to repair and restore the Project in accordance with the terms and provisions of the Loan Documents.  Any portion of the Award made available to the Borrower



 W-10



 for the repair or restoration of the Project shall not be subject to attachment by Subordinated Lender.



 7.           Foreclosure of the Subordinated Mortgage:  Subordinated Lender expressly agrees that, for so long as a Loan shall remain outstanding, (A) due notice of the commencement of any foreclosure of the Subordinated Loan Documents shall be given to Lender, and true copies of all papers served or entered in such action will be delivered to Lender, (B) no portion of the rents, issues and profits of the Project shall be collected in connection with the foreclosure of the Subordinated Loan Documents except through a receiver appointed by the court in which such foreclosure action is brought, after due notice for the appointment of such receiver shall have been given to Lender, (C) the rents, issues and profits collected by any such receiver shall be applied first to the payment of taxes, maintenance and operating charges and disbursements incurred in connection with the operation and maintenance of the Project and next to the payment of principal and interest (including, without limitation, default interest and late payment charges) due under the Loan Documents, and (D) if during the pendency of any such foreclosure action an action shall be brought for the foreclosure of the Loan Documents and an application shall be made for an extension of the receivership for the benefit of Lender, all such rents, issues and profits held by such receiver as of the date of such application shall be applied by the receiver solely for the benefit of Lender, and the Subordinated Lender shall not be entitled to any portion thereof until Lender has received all amounts then due to it.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Subordinated Lender consents to, and shall not object to, any action or proceeding at any time initiated by Lender for the appointment of a receiver and Subordinated Lender further agrees that it shall not institute any action or proceeding for the appointment of a receiver at any time during which a receiver shall have already been appointed for the benefit of Lender, and if Subordinated Lender shall have appointed or caused the appointment of a receiver prior to Lender's initiation of proceedings to do so, Subordinated Lender agrees to take all action reasonably necessary to terminate such appointment in order to facilitate Lender's appointment of same.



 8.           Rights of Subrogation.  No payment or distribution to Lender pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement and no Protective Advance by Subordinated Lender shall entitle Subordinated Lender to exercise any right of subrogation in respect thereof prior to the payment in full of the Loan, and Subordinated Lender agrees that, except with respect to the enforcement of its remedies under the Subordinated Loan Documents permitted hereunder, prior to the satisfaction of all obligations under the Loan it shall not acquire, by subrogation or otherwise, any lien, estate, right or other interest in any portion of the Project or any other collateral now securing the Loan or the proceeds therefrom that is or may be prior to, or of equal priority to, any of the Loan Documents or the liens, rights, estates and interests created thereby.



 9.           Transfer of Subordinated Loan or Loan.  Subordinated Lender shall not Transfer more than 49% of its beneficial interest in the Subordinated Loan unless either (i) a Rating Agency Confirmation has been given with respect to such Transfer, in which case the related transferee shall thereafter be deemed to be a "Qualified Transferee" for all purposes of this Agreement, or (ii) such Transfer is to a Qualified Transferee.  Any such transferee must assume in writing the obligations of Subordinated Lender hereunder and agree to be bound by the terms and provisions hereof.  Such proposed transferee shall also remake each of the representations and warranties contained herein for the benefit of the Lender.



 W-11



 At least five (5) days prior to a transfer to a Qualified Transferee, the Subordinated Lender shall provide to Lender a certification that such transfer will be made in accordance with this Section 9, such certification to include the name and contact information of the Qualified Transferee, and a statement as to how it meets the definition of Qualified Transferee.



 Subordinated Lender acknowledges that any Rating Agency Confirmation may be granted or denied by the Rating Agencies in their sole and absolute discretion and that such Rating Agencies may charge customary fees in connection with any such action, which fee, together with any and all other reasonable costs and expenses of Rating Agencies or Lender incurred in connection with the processing of same, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and costs, shall be paid by Subordinated Lender.



 Lender may, from time to time, in its sole discretion Transfer all or any of the Loan or any interest therein, and notwithstanding any such Transfer or subsequent Transfer, the Loan and the Loan Documents shall be and remain a senior obligation in the respects set forth in this Agreement to the Subordinated Loan and the Subordinated Loan Documents in accordance with the terms and provisions of this Agreement.



 Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement, Subordinated Lender agrees that it shall in no event Transfer all or any part of the Subordinated Loan to Borrower or to any Person which is an Affiliate of Borrower and any such Transfer shall be void ab initio.



 10.           Notices.  All notices required to be given hereunder shall be sent by first class, certified or registered mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested, or delivered by hand, to either party at such party's address first set forth above.  Notices shall be deemed to have been given when received.  Either party may change its address for notices hereunder by written notice to the other party.



 11.           Obligations Hereunder Not Affected.  All rights, interests, agreements and obligations of Lender and Subordinated Lender under this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect irrespective of:



 (i)           any lack of validity or enforceability of the Loan Documents or the Subordinated Loan Documents or any other agreement or instrument relating thereto;



 (ii)           any taking, exchange, release or non-perfection of any other collateral, or any taking, release or amendment or waiver of or consent to or departure from any guaranty, for all or any portion of the Loan or the Subordinated Loan;



 (iii)           any manner of application of collateral, or proceeds thereof, to all or any portion of the Loan or the Subordinated Loan, or any manner of sale or other disposition of any collateral for all or any portion of the Loan or the Subordinated Loan or any other assets of Borrower or any other Affiliates of Borrower;



 (iv)           any change, restructuring or termination of the corporate structure or existence of Borrower or any other Affiliates of Borrower; or



 W-12



 (v)           any other circumstance which might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, Borrower or a subordinated creditor or a Lender subject to the terms hereof.



 12.           Continued Effectiveness; Reinstatement.  This Agreement shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time any payment of all or any portion of the Loan is rescinded or must otherwise be returned by Lender or Subordinated Lender upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of Borrower or otherwise, all as though such payment had not been made.



 13.           Estoppel.



 (a)           Subordinated Lender shall, within ten (10) days following a request from Lender, provide Lender with a written statement setting forth the then current outstanding principal balance of the Subordinated Loan, the aggregate accrued and unpaid interest under the Subordinated Loan, and stating whether to Subordinated Lender's knowledge any default or Event of Default exists under the Subordinated Loan, it being intended that any such estoppel delivered pursuant to this Section 13 may be relied upon by Lender and by any prospective purchaser of all or any interest in the Loan.



 (b)           Lender shall, within ten (10) days following a request from Subordinated Lender, provide Subordinated Lender with a written statement setting forth the then current outstanding principal balance of the Loan, the aggregate accrued and unpaid interest under the Loan, and stating whether to Lender's knowledge any default or Event of Default exists under the Loan, it being intended that any such estoppel delivered pursuant to this Section 13 may be relied upon by Subordinated Lender and by any prospective purchaser of all or any interest in the Subordinated Loan.

 15.           Counterpart Originals.  This Agreement may be executed in counterpart originals, each of which shall constitute an original, and all of which together shall constitute one and the same agreement.



 16.           No Waiver; Remedies.  No failure on the part of Lender to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right.  The remedies herein provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any remedies provided by law.



 17.           No Joint Venture.  Nothing provided herein is intended to create a joint venture, partnership, tenancy in common or joint tenancy relationship between or among any of the parties hereto.

 20.           No Release.  Nothing herein contained shall operate to release Borrower from (a) its obligation to keep and perform all of the terms, conditions, obligations, covenants and agreements contained in the Loan Documents or (b) any liability of Borrower under the Loan Documents or to release Borrower from (x) its obligation to keep and perform all of the terms, conditions, obligations, covenants and agreements contained in the Subordinated Loan Documents or (y) any liability of Borrower under the Subordinated Loan Documents.



 21.           Severability.  In the event that any provision of this Agreement or the application hereof to any party hereto shall, to any extent, be invalid or unenforceable under any applicable statute, regulation, or rule of law, then such provision shall be deemed inoperative to the extent that it may conflict therewith and shall be deemed modified to conform to such statute, regulation or rule of law, and the remainder of this Agreement and the application of any such invalid or unenforceable provisions to parties, jurisdictions or circumstances other than to whom or to which it is held invalid or unenforceable, shall not be affected thereby nor shall same affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement.



 22.           Expenses.



 (a)           Subordinated Lender agrees upon demand to pay to Lender the amount of any and all reasonable expenses, including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and expenses of its counsel and of any experts or agents, which Lender may incur in connection with the (i) exercise or enforcement of any of the rights of Lender against Subordinated Lender hereunder to the extent that Lender is the prevailing party in any dispute with respect thereto or (ii) failure by Subordinated Lender to perform or observe any of the provisions hereof.

 23.           Injunction.  Lender and Subordinated Lender each acknowledge (and waive any defense based on a claim) that monetary damages are not an adequate remedy to redress a breach by the other hereunder and that a breach by either Lender or Subordinated Lender hereunder would cause irreparable harm to the other.  Accordingly, Lender and Subordinated Lender agree that upon a breach of this Agreement by the other, the remedies of injunction, declaratory judgment and specific performance shall be available to such non breaching party.
